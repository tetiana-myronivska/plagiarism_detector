_Nec aspera terrent._


PROLOGUE.


On the wall over the mantel-piece, here in my quiet study at
Eagle's-Nest, are two crossed swords. One is a battered old sabre worn
at Gettysburg, and Appomattox; the other, a Federal officer's dress
sword captured in 1863.

It was a mere fancy to place them there, as it was a whim to hang upon
that nail yonder, the uniform coat with its stars and braid, which
Stuart wore on his famous ride around McClellan in 1862. Under the
swords hang portraits of Lee, Jackson, and Stuart. Jackson wears his
old coat, and his brow is raised as though he were looking out from
beneath his yellow old cadet cap. Stuart is seated, grasping his sabre,
with his plumed hat resting on his knee. His huge beard flows on his
breast, his eyes are clear and penetrating, and beneath the picture I
have placed a slip cut from one of his letters to me, and containing

Never had the fields of Culpeper witnessed a spectacle more
magnificent. The sunshine darted in lightnings from the long line of
sabres, lit up beautiful faces, and flashed from scarfs, and waving
handkerchiefs, rosy cheeks, and glossy ringlets. All was life, and joy,
and splendor. For once war seemed turned to carnival; and flowers
wreathed the keen edge of the sword.

Among the illustrious figures gazed at by the crowd, two were the
observed of all the observers--those of Lee and Stuart.

Lee sat his powerful horse, with its plain soldierly equipments,
beneath the large flag. He was clad in a gray uniform, almost without
mark of rank. Cavalry boots reached nearly to his knees; as usual he
wore no sword; over his broad brow drooped a plain brown felt hat,
without tassel or decoration. Beneath, you saw a pair of frank and
benignant, but penetrating eyes, ruddy cheeks, and an iron gray
mustache and beard, both cut close. In the poise of the stately head,
as in the whole carriage of his person, there was something calm,
august and imposing. This man, it was plain, was not only great, but
good;--the true type of the race of gentlemen of other times.

Stuart, the chief of cavalry of the army, was altogether different in
appearance. Young, ardent, full of life and abandon, he was the true
reproduction of Rupert, said to be his ancestor. The dark cavalry
feather; the lofty forehead, and dazzling blue eyes; his little
"fighting jacket," as he called it, bright with braid and buttons, made
a picture. 'At a little before four o'clock, Albert drove me out in the
pony-phaeton till nearly six--such a drive! Really to be able to sit in
one's pony-carriage, and to see such wild, beautiful scenery as we
did, the furthest point being only five miles from the house, is an
immense delight.

We drove along Glen Tilt, through a wood overhanging the river Tilt, which
joins the Garry, and as we left the wood we came upon such a lovely
view--Ben-y-Gloe straight before us--and under these high hills the
river Tilt gushing and winding over stones and slates, and the hills
and mountains skirted at the bottom with beautiful trees; the
whole lit up by the sun; and the air so pure and fine; but no description
can at all do it justice, or give an idea of what this drive was.'
The royal pair mount their ponies, and with only one attendant, a
gillie, delight in getting above the world and out of it: 'Not a house,
not a creature near us, but the pretty Highland sheep, with their
horns and black faces, up at the top of Tulloch, surrounded by
beautiful mountains.'
The charms of natural scenery, greatly as they were appreciated, required
now and then to be relieved by a little excitement, and the Queen
and Prince hit upon an ingenious plan of procuring this.

They would issue forth from Balmoral in hired carriages, with horses to
match, and would drive to some Highland town, and dine and dress
at its inn, under assumed names. It was no doubt great fun to Her
Majesty to put up with the accommodation of a third-rate provincial
inn, where 'a ringleted woman did everything' in the way of waiting
at table, and where in place of soup there was mutton-broth with
vegetables, 'which I did not much relish.'

On one of these expeditions, Her Majesty was so unfortunate as to hit
upon the inn at Dalwhinnie as a place of sojourn. 'We went up-stairs:
the inn was much larger than at Fettercairn, but not nearly so nice
and cheerful; there was a drawing-room and a dining-room; and we
had a very good-sized bedroom. Albert had a dressing-room of equal
size.

Mary Andrews (who was very useful and efficient) and Lady Churchill's
maid had a room together, every one being in the house; but unfortunately
there was hardly anything to eat, and there was only tea, and two
miserable starved Highland chickens, without any potatoes! No pudding,
and no _fun_; no little maid (the two there not wishing to come
in), nor our two people--who were wet and drying our and their
things--to wait on us!

It was not a nice supper; and the evening was wet. As it was late, we
soon retired to rest.

Mary and Maxted (Lady Churchill's maid) had been dining below with
Grant, Brown, and Stewart (who came the same as last time, with the
maids) in the "commercial room" at the foot of the stairs.
If the reader has done me the honor to peruse the first volume of my
memoirs, I indulge the vanity of supposing that he will like to be
informed how I became a member of General Stuart's staff.

When oaks crash down they are apt to prostrate the saplings growing
around them. Jackson was a very tall oak, and I a very humble sapling.
When the great trunk fell, the mere twig disappeared. I had served with
Jackson from the beginning of the war; that king of battle dead at
Chancellorsville, I had found myself without a commander, and without a
home. I was not only called upon in that May of 1863, to mourn the
illustrious soldier, who had done me the honor to call me his friend; I
had also to look around me for some other general; some other position
in the army.

When a storm is coming, the civilian seeks shelter; but the soldier
carrying an order, wraps his cape around him, and rides on. I went on
past Brandy and Fleetwood Hill, descended toward the river, entered a
great belt of woods--then night and storm descended simultaneously. An
artillery duel seemed going on in the clouds; the flickering lightnings
amid the branches resembled serpents of fire: the wind rolled through
the black wood, tearing off boughs in its passage.

I pushed my horse to full speed to emerge from this scene of crashing
limbs and tottering trunks. I had just passed a little stream, when
from a by-road on my left came the trample of hoofs. It is good to be
on the watch in the cavalry, and I wheeled to the right,
listening--when all at once a brilliant flash of lightning showed me,
within fifty paces, a column of _blue_ cavalry.

"Halt!" rang out from the column, and a pistol-shot followed.

I did not halt. Capture was becoming a hideous affair in June, 1863. I
passed across the head of the column at full speed, followed by
bullets; struck into a bridle-path on the right, and pushed ahead,
hotly pursued.

They had followed me nearly half a mile, firing on me, and ordering me
to halt, when suddenly a sonorous "Halt!" resounded fifty yards in
front of me; and a moment afterward, a carbine ball passed through my
riding cape.

I drove on at full speed, convinced that these in front were friends;
and the chest of my horse struck violently against that of another in
the darkness.

"Halt, or you are dead!" came in the same commanding voice.

Another flash of lightning showed me a squadron of _gray_ cavalry: at
their head rode a cavalier, well mounted; it was his horse against
which I had struck, and he held a cocked pistol to my breast.

The lightning left nothing in doubt. Gray and blue quickly recognized
each other. The blue cavalry had drawn rein, and, at that moment, the
leader of the grays shouted--"Charge!" A rush of hoofs, and then a
quick clash of sabres followed. The adversaries had hurled together.
The wood suddenly became the scene of a violent combat.

It was a rough affair. For ten minutes the result was doubtful. The
Federal cavalry were apparently commanded by an officer of excellent
nerve, and he fought his men obstinately. For nearly a quarter of an
hour the wood was full of sabre-strokes, carbine-shots, and yells,
which mingled with the roll of the storm. Then the fight ended.

My friend of the cocked pistol threw himself, sabre in hand, upon the
Federal front, and it shook, and gave back, and retreated. The weight
of the onset seemed to sweep it, inch by inch, away. The blue squadron
finally broke, and scattered in every direction. The grays pressed on
with loud cheers, firing as they did so:--five minutes afterward, the
storm-lashed wood had swallowed pursuers and pursued.

The whole had disappeared like phantom horsemen in the direction of the
Rappahannock.


IV.


MOHUN AND HIS PRISONER.


Half an hour afterward, the storm had spent its fury, and I was
standing by a bivouac fire on the banks of the Rappahannock, conversing
with the officer against whom I had driven my horse in the darkness.

Mounted upon a powerful gray, he had led the attack with a sort of
fury, and I now looked at him with some curiosity.

He was a man of about thirty, of gaunt face and figure, wearing a hat
with a black feather, and the uniform of a colonel of cavalry. The
features were regular and might have been called handsome; the eyes,
hair, mustache, and imperial--he wore no beard--coal black; the
complexion so pale that the effect was startling. More curious than all
else, however, was the officer's expression. In the lips and eyes could
be read something bitterly cynical, mingled with a profound and
apparently ineradicable melancholy. After looking at my new
acquaintance for an instant, I said to myself: "This man has either
suffered some great grief, or committed some great crime."

His bearing was cold, but courteous.

"I recognized you as soon as I saw you, colonel," he said, in response
to my salute. "You probably do not know me, however, as I have just
been transferred from the Army of the West. Colonel Mohun, at your
service."

I exchanged a pressure of the hand with Colonel Mohun, or, speaking
more correctly, I grasped his. It did not return the pressure. I then
thanked him for his timely appearance, and he bowed coldly.

"It was lucky that my scout led me in this direction," he said, "that
party is whipped back over the river, and will give us no more trouble
to-night--the woods are full of their dead and wounded."

As he spoke he took a cigar case from his pocket, and presented it.

"Will you smoke, sir?" he said.

I bowed and selected a cigar. Colonel Mohun imitated me, and was about
to commence smoking, when two or three cavalry men were seen
approaching through the gloom, apparently escorting some one.

As they drew nearer the figures became plainer in the firelight. The
cavalry men had in charge a female prisoner.

She was a woman of petite figure, clad in a handsome gray riding-habit,
and mounted upon a superb horse, with rich equipments, apparently
belonging to a Federal officer of high rank. From the horse, I glanced
at the prisoner's face. It was a strange countenance. She was about
twenty-five--her complexion was dead white, except the lips which were
as red as carnations; her eyes were large and brilliant, her hair dark
and worn plain under a small riding-hat. In one delicately gauntleted
hand she held the rein of her horse--with the other, which was
ungloved, she raised a lace handkerchief to her lips. On the finger
sparkled a diamond.

There was something strange in the expression of this woman. She looked
"dangerous" in spite of her calmness.

She sat gazing at some one behind me, with the handkerchief still
raised to her lips. Then she took it away, and I could see a smile upon
them.

What was the origin of that smile, and at whom was she looking? I
turned, and found myself face to face with Colonel Mohun. His
appearance almost frightened me. His countenance wore the hue of a
corpse, his whole frame shook with quick shudders, and his eyes were
distended until the black pupils shone in the centres of two white
circles.

Suddenly his teeth clinched audibly; he passed his hand over his
forehead streaming with cold sweat; and said in a low voice:

"Then you are not dead, madam?"

The already aged Queen continued to reign for only a few years
longer.

The new century had hardly dawned when she was stricken down by the
hand of death. After a brief illness she passed away at Osborne on
22d January 1901, amidst an outburst of sorrow from the whole
civilised world.

Next day the Prince of Wales was proclaimed as King Edward VII.

On Saturday, 2d February, amid a splendid naval and military pageant,
the body of the Queen was borne to St George's Chapel, Windsor, and
on Monday buried in the Frogmore Mausoleum beside Prince Albert.

CHAPTER X.

Summary of Public Events, 1856-93--Civil War in America--Extension
of the Franchise--Disestablishment of Irish Church-Education Act
of 1870--Wars in China and Abyssinia--Purchase of Suez Canal
Shares--Wars in Afghanistan, Zululand, and Egypt--Home Rule
Bill--Growth of the Empire and National Progress.

We now continue our summary of public affairs.

The Crimean War had been finished, and the mutiny had broken out,
whilst Lord Palmerston was prime-minister.

In 1858 he was obliged to resign his post; but he returned to office
next year, and this he held till his death in 1865.

Under him there was quiet both in home and in foreign affairs, and
we managed to keep from being mixed up with the great wars which
raged abroad.

Seldom has a premier been better liked than Lord Palmerston.

Nominally a Whig, but at heart an old-fashioned Tory, he was first
and foremost an Englishman, ever jealous for Britain's credit and
security.

He was not gifted with burning eloquence or biting sarcasm; but his
vigour, straightforwardness, good sense, and kindliness endeared
him even to his adversaries.

Honestly indifferent to domestic reform, but a finished master of foreign
politics, he was of all men the man to guide the nation through
the ten coming years, which at home were a season of calm and
reaction, but troubled and threatening abroad.

Besides the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny, we had another war
with China, as unjust as the opium war of sixteen years before, and
quite as successful.

In 1856, the Canton authorities seized the crew of a Chinese pirate
which carried a British flag.

Under strong pressure from British officials, Commissioner Yeh
surrendered the crew, but refused all apology, whereupon Canton was
bombarded.

A twelvemonth later, it was stormed by the British and French allied
forces; Yeh was captured, and sent off to die at Calcutta; and in
June 1858 a treaty was signed, throwing open all China to British
subjects.

In a third war (1859-60), to enforce the terms of that treaty, Pekin
surrendered, and its vast Summer Palace was sacked and destroyed.

In January 1858, an attempt on the life of the Emperor Napoleon was
made by Orsini, an Italian refugee, who had hatched his plot and
procured his bomb-shells in England.

Lord Palmerston therefore introduced a bill, removing conspiracy to
murder from the class of misdemeanour to that of felony.

The defeat of that bill, as a truckling to France, brought in the second
Derby administration, which lasted sixteen months, and in which a
professed Jew was first admitted to parliament, in the person of
Baron Rothschild. Another Jew, by race but not by creed, Mr Disraeli,
was at the time the leader of the House of Commons. His new Reform Bill
satisfied nobody; its rejection was followed by a dissolution;
and Lord Palmerston returned to office, June 1859.

Sardinia had aided France against Russia, and France was now aiding
Sardinia to expel the Austrians from Italy. The campaign was short
and successful; but rejoice as we might for the cause of Italian
unity, the French emperor's activity suggested his future invasion
of Britain; and to this period belongs the development, if not the
beginning, of our Volunteer army, which, from 150,000 in 1860,
increased to upwards of 200,000 in twenty-five years.

Still, a commercial treaty with France, on free-trade lines, was
negotiated between Louis Napoleon and Mr Cobden; and Mr Gladstone
carried it through parliament in the face of strong opposition.

Lord John Russell again introduced a Reform Bill, but the apathy of Lord
Palmerston, and the pressure of other business, led to its quiet
withdrawal.

The rejection by the Lords of a bill to abolish the duty on paper
seemed likely at one time to lead to a collision between the two
Houses.

Ultimately the Commons contented themselves with a protest against
this unwonted stretch of authority, and the paper-duty was removed
in 1861.

From 1861 to 1865, a civil war raged in America, between the slave-holding
Southern States (the Confederates) and the abolitionist Northern States
(the Federals). At first, British feeling was strongly in favour of the
Northerners; but it changed before long, partly in consequence of
their seizure of two Confederate envoys on a British mail-steamer, the
_Trent_, and of the interruption of our cotton trade, which caused
a cotton famine and great distress in Lancashire.

With the war itself, and the final hard-won triumph of the North, we had
no immediate connection; but the Southern cause was promoted by five
privateers being built in England.

These armed cruisers were not professedly built for the Southerners,
but under false pretences were actually equipped for war against
Northern commerce.

One of them, the _Alabama_, was not merely built in a British
dockyard, but manned for the most part by a British crew. In her two
years' cruise she burned sixty-five Federal merchantmen.
The Federal government protested at the time; but it was not till 1872
that the Alabama question was peacefully settled by arbitration
in a conference at Geneva, and we had to pay three millions sterling
in satisfaction of the American claims.

Other events during the Palmerston administration were a tedious
native rebellion in New Zealand (1860-65); the marriage of the
Prince of Wales to the Princess Alexandra of Denmark (1863); the
cession of the Ionian Isles to Greece (1864); and on the Continent
there was the Schleswig-Holstein War (1864), in which, beset by
both Prussia and Austria, Denmark looked, but looked vainly, for
succour from Britain.

As the Reform Bill of 1832 excluded the great bulk of the
working classes from the franchise, it was felt by many that it
could not be a final measure; and no long time had passed before
agitation for further reform had commenced.

In the year 1854 the veteran Lord John Russell once more brought the
subject before the House of Commons; but the attention of the country
was fixed on the war with Russia, and it was not thought a good
time to deal with the question of reform.

Again, in 1859, the cabinet of Earl Derby brought forward a scheme; but
it also failed.

In the year 1866, Earl Russell was once more at the head of affairs;
and it seemed at one time that the aged statesman would succeed in
giving the country a second Reform Bill.

After many debates, however, Lord Russell's scheme was rejected,
and he resigned.

The Earl of Derby next became premier, with Mr Disraeli as leader
of the House of Commons. These statesmen succeeded at length in
finding a way for settling the vexed question; and the result was
a measure which greatly extended the franchise.

The new bill gave the privilege of voting to all householders in
boroughs who paid poor-rates, without regard to the amount of rent. A
lodger qualification of £10 a year was also introduced.

In the counties all who paid a rent of not less than £12 were
entitled to a vote.
Generally speaking, it may be said that previous to 1832 the upper
classes controlled the representation; the first Reform Bill gave
the franchise to the middle classes; while the second conferred it
on a large section of the working classes.

Such was the Reform Bill of 1867, which made important changes in our
system of election. One of the most pleasing features of this and other
reforms which we have effected, is the fact that they have been
brought about in a peaceful way. While in France and most other European
countries, changes in government have frequently been accompanied by
revolution and civil war, we have been able to improve our laws without
disturbance and without bloodshed.

After the passing of this important act, Mr Gladstone came into
power with a large Liberal majority.

He had long been one of the foremost orators and debaters of the party.
Originally a Conservative, he had become a freetrader with Sir
Robert Peel, and for the next few years was a prominent member of the
Peelite party. During Lord Palmerston's second administration, he
made a most successful Chancellor of the Exchequer.

For some years he had represented Oxford University as a Conservative;
but at the general election of 1865, he lost his seat owing to the liberal
tendencies he had lately shown.

Henceforward he became one of the most decided Liberals; and after
the retirement of Earl Russell in 1866, he became the leader of
that party.

[Illustration: William Ewart Gladstone. (From a Photograph by R.

W.
Thomas.)]

Under him many reforms were carried.

The Protestant Episcopal Church of Ireland, whose adherents formed only
a small minority of the population, was disestablished.

Thus at one blow a very important element of the religious difficulty,
which had caused so much trouble in Ireland, was removed.

A measure was also passed, giving the Irish tenant a greater interest
in the soil which he cultivated.

Of all the great measures for the benefit of the working classes which
have been passed during the present century, none deserves a higher
place than the Education Bill of 1870. A great change for the better had
been made in the condition of the people. Their food had been
cheapened; the conditions under which they performed their daily
toil in the factory or the mine had been improved; and their comforts
greatly increased.

In all these respects their lot compared favourably with that of
other nations.
But in education the English were still far behind some of their
neighbours, and especially the Germans.

For thirty or forty years before the passing of the Education
Act, a great deal had been done by voluntary effort towards supplying
the educational needs of the people in England.

The National Society, and the British and Foreign Society, by building
schools and training teachers, had done much for the children of our
native land.

Parliament also had lent its aid, by voting an annual grant towards the
expenses of the existing schools.

But the population was increasing so rapidly that, in spite of these
efforts, there was still a great lack of schools.

After all that had been done, it was calculated that there yet remained
two-thirds of the juvenile population of the country for whom no provision
had been made.

An inquiry into the condition of education in some of the large
towns showed sad results.

In Birmingham, out of a population of 83,000 children of school
age, only 26,000 were under instruction; Leeds showed a proportion
of 58,000 to 19,000; and so on with other towns.

These figures startled men of all parties; and it was felt that not
a moment more ought to be lost in providing for the educational
needs which had been shown to exist.

Accordingly, Mr Forster, the Vice-president of the Council, a statesman
whose name will be honourably handed down in connection with this
great question, brought in his famous scheme for grappling with the
difficulty.

Like all great measures, it was noted for its simplicity.

It laid down, in the first place, the great principle that 'there should
be efficient school provision in every district of England where it was
wanted; and that every child in the country should have the means
of education placed within its reach.' To carry this principle into
effect, it appointed boards of management, or school boards, to be
elected at intervals of three years by the ratepayers themselves.

The chief duties of these boards were defined to be, the erection
of schools in all places where sufficient provision did not already
exist; and the framing of bylaws, by which they might compel
attendance at school in cases where the parents showed themselves
indifferent to the welfare of their children.

These were the main features of the bill, which passed through
parliament, and speedily became the law of the land.

Since the passing of the Education Act, the results achieved by it
in England have been most gratifying.

The number of children attending school has largely increased; the
quality of the instruction has been greatly improved; and in districts
which were formerly neglected, excellent school buildings have been
erected and fitted up.

By means of the excellent education provided in her parish schools Scotland
had long held a foremost place among the nations of the world.
Yet it was felt that even there the system of education needed improvement.
Accordingly, in 1872, school boards were established and other changes
in education were made in Scotland.

There were other minor but still important changes in other departments.

It was provided that the right to hold the position of commissioned or
higher officers in the army should be given by open examination,
and not be bought as hitherto. All students, without distinction as
to religious creed, were admitted to the privileges of the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Voters were protected in the
exercise of their rights by the introduction of the _Ballot_, or
system of secret voting.

The country now seemed to be tired of reform for a time, and the
Gladstone ministry was overthrown.

During the period of which we treat, though we had no great war,
we had a number of small conflicts.

The series of quarrels with China may be said to have terminated
with our conquest of Pekin in 1860.

In 1869 the conduct of King John of Abyssinia, in unlawfully imprisoning
English subjects, compelled us to send an expedition to rescue them,
which it successfully accomplished; and in 1873 we were obliged
to send another expedition against King Koffee of Ashanti, on the
West African coast, who attacked our allies.

This expedition was also a complete success, as we forced our foes
to agree to a peace advantageous for us.

In addition may be recorded the successful laying of the Atlantic cable
(1866), after nine years of vain endeavour; the passing of an act
(1867), under which British North America is all, except Newfoundland,
now federally united in the vast Dominion of Canada, with a constitution
like that of the mother-country; and the purchase by government
of the telegraph system (1868).

On the fall of the Gladstone ministry in 1874, a Conservative one,
under Mr Disraeli (afterwards Lord Beaconsfield), came into power,
and for some years managed the national affairs.

During these years, several important measures affecting the foreign
affairs of our empire were carried out.

We purchased a large number of shares in the French company which owns
the Suez Canal. British ships going to India pass through that canal,
and therefore it was considered by our rulers that it would be for
our advantage to have a good deal to do with the management of the
company.

In India, since the suppression of the Mutiny, and abolition of the
East India Company, the Queen had the direct rule.

Stuart looked keenly at the wagon, called to the driver to halt, and
demanded whither he was going, and on what business. The old countryman
smiled. The question seemed to strike him as absurd, and his
explanation was simple and calculated to remove all suspicion. He
stated that his name was Brown--that he lived near the village; had
brought in a load of vegetables to sell, on the preceding evening--some
friends had persuaded him and "his old woman" to spend the night, and
they were now going home.

Stuart peered under the coal-scuttle bonnet.

"And this is your 'old woman' my friend," he said with a laugh.

"Jest so, sir," was the wheezy reply of the fat old countryman, smiling
sweetly. "You see she would come along, sir. Womankind is mighty
contrary!"

"A profound sentiment!" laughed Stuart, and riding on without further
words, he left the countryman free to proceed on his way.

We crossed a little stream, rode on toward Fleetwood, and had nearly
reached Brandy when Stuart suddenly reined in his horse.

"Do you know what I think," he said, "that I have done a foolish
thing?"

"What, general?"

"To let that old fellow go on. I don't like his looks."

"The old countryman?"

"Yes; I wish I had arrested him--him and his wife."

"Arrested them?"

Stuart nodded.

"I have an instinct about rascals, Surry; and something tells me that I
have been guilty of an imprudence."

"Was not his explanation satisfactory?"

"No."

"What could be wrong?"

"Everything."

"And his 'old woman,'" I said, laughing; "think of that highly
respectable dame."

"I like her least of all!"

"From instinct?"

"If you choose."

"I think your instinct misleads you this time, general."

"I think not."

"Well, we will see."

And we did see.

In two hours the head-quarters tents were pitched upon Fleetwood Hill
beyond Brandy, and Stuart sent his provost marshal to Culpeper
Court-House, with orders to conduct the prisoner taken by Mohun on the
preceding night, to General Lee, for examination.

An hour afterward the worthy provost returned in hot haste with the
astounding information that the fair lady was nowhere to be found. She
had disappeared from her chamber, none knew how, before daylight, and
as a notoriously suspected individual who had lately been hanging round
the tavern had disappeared too, it was probable that they had gone off
together. Upon this point, a note left by the lady directed to "General
Stuart" would probably give information. This had been found upon her
table. And the provost wound up by handing the note to Stuart.

He read it with an air of decided ill-humor. Then throwing it upon his
desk, burst into a laugh.

"Well, Surry," he said, "who is right and who is wrong, now? Read
that!"

And he pointed to the note, which I opened and read. It was in a
delicate female hand, and ran as follows:--

"General Stuart will pardon the attempt his captive is about to make,
to effect her escape. We sang again last night, and after Costa went
away, I sorted a quantity of music for the Queen; and then Prince Albert
said he had composed a German ballad, which he thought would suit my
voice, and he wished me to sing it. So his royal highness accompanied
me, and I sang it at sight, which rather alarmed me; but I got through
it, and it is very pretty. The Duchess of Kent has promised to have
it copied for me.'

In 1847 Baron Stockmar wrote: 'The Queen improves greatly. She makes
daily advances in discernment and experience; the candour, the
love of truth, the fairness, the considerateness with which she judges
men and things are truly delightful, and the ingenuous self-knowledge
with which she speaks about herself is simply charming.'

It was not perhaps surprising that the Queen's views and the
prince's views on public questions coincided.

When Lord Shaftesbury, then Lord Ashley, delivered a very able
speech on the Mine and Colliery Bill, the Prince-Consort wrote, 'I
have carefully perused your speech, which you were so good as to
send me, and I have been highly gratified by your efforts, as well
as horror-stricken by the statements which you have brought before
the country.

I know you do not wish for praise, and I therefore withhold it; but
God's best blessing will rest with you and support you in your
arduous but glorious task.'

In 1848, a year of revolution, the Prince-Consort consulted Lord
Shaftesbury as to his attitude towards the working-classes.

The interview took place at Osborne, and the Queen and
Prince-Consort were greatly alarmed by the revolution in France
and the exile of Louis-Philippe.

'They feared the continuance of commotions in England, and were
desirous to know how they could exercise their influence to soothe
the people.

The Queen, on my arrival, expressed this sentiment very warmly, and
added at dinner, "The prince will talk to you to-morrow.

We have sent for you to have your opinion on what we should do in
view of the state of affairs to show our interest in the working-classes,
and you are the only man who can advise us in the matter."'

On the following morning, during a long walk of an hour and a
half in the garden, Lord Shaftesbury counselled the prince to put
himself at the head of all social movements in art and science, and
especially of those movements as they bore upon the poor, and thus
would he show the interest felt by royalty in the happiness of the
kingdom.

The prince did so with marked success; and after he had presided
at a Labourers' Friend Society, a noted Socialist remarked, 'If the
prince goes on like this, why, he'll upset our apple-cart.'

The poet-laureate is an official attached to the household of
royalty, and it was long his duty to write an ode on the king's
birthday.

Towards the end of the reign of George III. this was dropped.

On the death of the poet Wordsworth on 23d April 1850, the next poet-laureate
was Alfred Tennyson.

The Queen, it is said, had picked up one of his earlier volumes,
and had been charmed with his 'Miller's Daughter;' her procuring a
copy of the volume for the Princess Alice gave a great impetus to
his popularity.

No poet has ever written more truly and finely about royalty, as
witness the dedication to the _Idylls of the King_, which enshrines
the memory of the Prince-Consort; or the beautiful dedication to
the Queen, dated March 1851, which closes thus:
Her court was pure, her life serene; God gave her peace; her land
reposed; A thousand claims to reverence closed In her as Mother,
Wife, and Queen.

And statesmen at her council met Who knew the seasons, when to take
Occasion by the hand, and make The bounds of freedom wider yet.

'It is perhaps natural,' says a contemporary writer, 'for the
laureates to be loyal, but there is no doubt that the sincere
tributes which he paid to the Queen and to her consort contributed
materially to the steadying of the foundation of the British throne.

He almost alone among the poets gave expression to the inarticulate
loyalty of the ordinary Englishman, and he did it without being
either servile or sycophantic.

If it were only for his dedication to the Queen and Prince-Consort,
he would have repaid a thousand times over the value of all the
bottles of sherry and the annual stipends the poet-laureates have
received since the days of Ben Jonson.'

Mrs Gilchrist writes: 'Tennyson likes and admires the Queen
personally much, enjoys conversation with her. Mrs Tennyson generally
goes too, and says the Queen's manner towards him is childlike and
charming, and they both give their opinions freely, even when these
differ from the Queen's, which she takes with perfect humour, and
is very animated herself.'

The Prince-Consort, to whom Tennyson dedicated his _Idylls of the
King_,
Since he held them dear, Perchance as finding there unconsciously
Some image of himself,
had his copy inscribed with the poet's autograph.

One most characteristic feature of the Queen's reign was the inauguration,
in 1851, of that system of International Exhibitions which has
infused a new and larger spirit into commerce, and whose influence as
yet only begins to work. The idea came from the Prince-Consort, and
was carried out by his unfailing industry, energy, and perseverance.
Sir Joseph Paxton's genius raised a palace of crystal in Hyde Park,
inclosing within it some of the magnificent trees, few, if any, of
which were destroyed by the undertaking. As Thackeray wrote:

A blazing arch of lucid glass Leaps like a fountain from the grass
To meet the sun.

The Queen took the greatest interest in the work, which she felt
was her husband's.

She visited it almost daily, entering into interested conversation
with the manufacturers who had brought their wares for display. The
building was opened on the 1st of May, which the Queen names in
her diary as 'a day which makes my heart swell with pride and glory
and thankfulness.'

She dwells lovingly on 'the tremendous cheers, the joy expressed
in every face,' adding, 'We feel happy--so full of thankfulness.
God is indeed our kind and merciful Father.'
After the building had served its purpose, the exhibition building was
removed to Sydenham, a London suburb then almost in the country,
and opened by the Queen, 10th June 1854.

Under its new name of the 'Crystal Palace' it has since been the resort
of millions of pleasure-seekers. It was fondly hoped by its promoters
that the Great Exhibition would knit the nations together in
friendship, and 'inaugurate a long reign of peace.'

Yet the year 1851 was not out before Louis Napoleon overthrew the new
French Republic, of which he had been elected president, by a _coup
d'état_, or 'stroke of policy,' as cruel as it was cowardly.

Lord Palmerston's approval of this outrage, without the knowledge
of either the Queen or Lord John Russell, procured him his dismissal
from the cabinet.

Two months later, however, Palmerston 'gave Russell his tit-for-tat,'
defeating him over a Militia Bill.

In the year 1852, amid the anxieties consequent on the sudden assumption
of imperial power by Louis Napoleon, the Queen writes thus to her uncle,
King Leopold: 'I grow daily to dislike politics and business more
and more.

We women are not made for governing, and if we are good women, we must
dislike these masculine occupations.'
It was about this time that unjust reports were circulated concerning the
political influence of Prince Albert, who was represented as 'inimical
to the progress of liberty throughout the world, and the friend of
reactionary movements and absolute government.' When parliament was
opened, the prince was completely vindicated, and his past services
to the country, as the bosom counsellor of the sovereign, were
made clear.

The Queen naturally felt the pain of these calumnies more deeply than
did the prince himself, but on the anniversary of her wedding day she
could write:
'Trials we must have; but what are they if we are together?'

[Illustration: Duke of Wellington.]
In 1852 the great Duke of Wellington died, full of years and honours.
He passed quietly away in his sleep, in his simple camp-bed
in the castle of Walmer. Though he had been opposed to the Reform
Bill and many other popular measures, he was still loved and
respected by the nation for his high sense of duty and his many
sterling qualities.

The hero of Waterloo was laid beside the hero of Trafalgar in St Paul's
Cathedral. He was lowered into his grave by some of his old
comrades-in-arms, who had fought and conquered under him; and from
the Queen to the humblest of her subjects, it was felt on that day
'that a great man was dead.'

Of his death the Queen wrote: 'What a _loss!_ We cannot think of this
country without "the Duke," our immortal hero! In him centred almost
every earthly honour a subject could possess....

With what singleness of purpose, what straightforwardness, what
courage, were all the motives of his actions guided!

The crown never possessed--and I fear never _will_--so devoted,
loyal, and faithful a subject, so staunch a supporter.'

An eccentric miser, J.

C. Neild, who died 30th August 1852, left £250,000 to Her Majesty.
This man had pinched and starved himself for thirty years in order to
accumulate this sum. The Queen satisfied herself that he had no relations
living, before accepting the money.

CHAPTER IV.

Chief Public Events, 1837-49--Rebellion in Canada--Opium War with China--Wars
in North-west India--Penny Postage--Repeal of the Corn-laws--Potato
Famine--Free Trade--Chartism.

The Queen had been only a few months on the throne when tidings
arrived of a rebellion in Canada.

The colonists had long been dissatisfied with the way in which the
government was conducted by the mother-country.

In the year 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were united into one province,
and though the union was not at first a success, the colonists were
granted the power of managing their own affairs; and soon came to
devote their efforts to developing the resources of the country,
and ceased to agitate for complete independence.

The principle of union then adopted has since been extended to most of
the other North American colonies; and at the present time the Dominion
of Canada stretches across the whole breadth of the continent from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.

Another contest which marked the early years of the new reign was
the inglorious war with China (1839-42).

The Chinese are great consumers of opium, a hurtful drug, which produces
a sort of dreamy stupor or intoxication.

The opium poppy is extensively grown in India, and every year large
quantities were exported to China. The government of the latter country,
professedly anxious to preserve its subjects from the baneful influence
of this drug, entirely prohibited the trade in it.

Several cargoes of opium belonging to British merchants were seized and
destroyed, and the trading ports closed against our vessels.

Our government resented this conduct as an interference with the
freedom of commerce, and demanded compensation and the keeping open
of the ports.

As the Chinese refused to submit to the demands of those whom they
considered barbarous foreigners, a British armament was sent to
enforce our terms.

The Celestials fought bravely enough, but British discipline had
all its own way.

Neither the antiquated junks nor the flimsily constructed forts of the
enemy were any match for our men-of-war.

Several ports had been bombarded and Nankin threatened, when
the Chinese yielded.

They were compelled to pay nearly six millions sterling towards the
expenses of the war; to give up to us the island of Hong-Kong; and
to throw open Canton, Shanghai, and three other ports to our
commerce.

During this period also the British took a prominent part in upholding
the Sultan of Turkey against his revolted vassal, Mehemet Ali, the
Pasha of Egypt.

The latter, a very able prince, had overrun Syria; and there seemed every
likelihood that he would shortly establish his independence, and
add besides a considerable portion of Turkish territory to his
dominions.

Lord Palmerston, the British foreign minister, however, brought
about an alliance with Austria and the eastern powers of Europe to
maintain the integrity of the Turkish empire.

The Egyptians were driven out of Syria, and the supremacy of the Turks
restored.

The energetic action of Lord Palmerston at this crisis brought him much
popularity; and from this time until his death, twenty-five years
later, the nation almost absolutely trusted him in all foreign
affairs.

[Illustration: Sir Robert Peel.]

So necessary at the present day has the penny post become to all
classes of the people, that we can scarcely realise how our forefathers
managed to live without it.

Yet even so recently as the accession of Victoria, the nation was not
in the enjoyment of this great blessing.

So seldom in those days did a letter reach the abode of a working-man,
that when the postman did make his approach, he was thought to be
the bearer of news of great importance.

The adoption of the penny postage scheme was the only great measure
of Lord Melbourne's ministry during the early years of the new reign.

The credit of it, however, did not in reality belong to the ministers.

The measure was forced upon them by the pressure of public opinion, which
had been enlightened by Rowland Hill's pamphlet upon the question.

Hill was the son of a Birmingham schoolmaster; and thus, like so many
other benefactors of the human race, was of comparatively humble
origin.

He had thoroughly studied the question of postal reform, and his
pamphlet, which was first published in 1837, had a great effect
upon the public mind.

Previous to this, indeed, several other persons had advocated the
reform of the post-office system, and notably Mr Wallace, member
of parliament for Greenock.

Before 1839, the rates of postage had been very heavy, and varied according
to the distance.

From one part of London, or any other large town, to another, the rate
was 2d.; from London to Brighton, 8d.; to Edinburgh, 1s. 1d.; and to
Belfast, 1s. 4d.

Some of these charges were almost equal to the daily wages of a
labouring-man.

There was considerable opposition to the new measure, especially
among the officials of the postal department.

Many prominent men, too, both in and out of parliament, were afraid
it would never pay. The clever and witty Sydney Smith spoke slightingly
of it as the 'nonsensical penny postage scheme.' In spite of the objections
urged against it, however, it was adopted by parliament in the later
part of 1839, and brought into actual operation in January 1840;
and the example set by this country has since been followed by all
civilised states.

Every letter was now to be _prepaid_ by affixing the penny stamp. In
this way a letter not exceeding half-an-ounce in weight could be
carried to any part of the United Kingdom.

In 1871 the rate was reduced to a penny for one ounce. The success
of this great measure is best shown by the increase of letters delivered
in Great Britain and Ireland: from 85 millions in 1839, the number had
more than doubled by 1892. Thus, at the present time, the income
from stamps forms no inconsiderable item of the revenue; while it
need scarcely be said that the advantages of the penny post, both to
business men and the public generally, cannot be over-estimated.

Between the years 1839 and 1849 the British were engaged in a
series of military enterprises in the north-west of India, which greatly
tried the bravery of our soldiers, and were attended even with
serious disaster.

They resulted, however, in the conquest of the territories in the
basin of the Indus, and in establishing the British sway in India more
firmly than ever.

With the view of averting certain dangers which seemed to threaten our
Indian empire in that quarter, the English invaded Afghanistan. The
expedition was, in the first instance, completely successful. Candahar
and Cabul were both occupied by British troops, and a prince friendly
to England was placed upon the throne (1839). The main force then
returned to India, leaving garrisons at Candahar and Cabul to keep
the hostile tribes in order.

The troops left behind at Cabul were destined to terrible disaster.
General Elphinstone, who commanded, relying too much on the good faith
of the Afghans, omitted to take wise measures of defence. The Afghans
secretly planned a revolt against the English, and the general,
finding himself cut off from help from India, weakly sought to make
terms with the enemy.

The Afghans proved treacherous, and General Elphinstone was reduced
to begin a retreat through the wild passes towards India.

It was a fearful march.

The fierce tribes who inhabited the hilly country along the route
attacked our forces in front, flank, and rear.

It was the depth of winter, and the sepoy troops, benumbed with
cold, and unable to make any defence, were cut down without mercy.

Of the whole army, to the number of 4500 fighting men and 12,000 camp
followers, which had left Cabul, only one man (Dr Brydon) reached
Jellalabad in safety. All the rest had perished or been taken
captive.

As soon as the news of this disaster reached India, prompt steps were
taken to punish the Afghans and rescue the prisoners who had been
left in their hands.

General Pollock fought his way through the Khyber Pass, and reached
Jellalabad. He then pushed forward to Cabul, and on the way the
soldiers were maddened by the sight of the skeletons of their late
comrades, which lay bleaching on the hill-sides along the route.

They exacted a terrible vengeance wherever they met the foe, and
the Afghans fled into their almost inaccessible mountains.

General Nott, with the force from Candahar, united with Pollock at Cabul.
The English prisoners were safely restored to their anxious friends.
After levelling the fortifications of Cabul, the entire force left the
country.

Shortly afterwards, war broke out with the Ameers of Scinde, a large
province occupying the basin of the lower Indus. The British commander,
Sir Charles Napier, speedily proved to the enemy that the spirit of
the British army had not failed since the days of Plassey. With a
force of only 3000 men, he attacked and completely defeated two
armies much superior in numbers (1843).

The result of these two victories--Meanee and Dubba--was the annexation
of Scinde to the British dominions.

The main stream of the Indus is formed by the junction of five smaller
branches.

The large and fertile tract of country watered by these tributary streams
is named the Punjab, or the land of the 'five waters.' It was inhabited
by a people called the Sikhs, who, at first a religious sect, have
gradually become the bravest and fiercest warriors in India.
They had a numerous army, which was rendered more formidable by a
large train of artillery and numerous squadrons of daring cavalry.

After being long friendly to us, disturbances had arisen among them;
the army became mutinous and demanded to be led against the British.
Much severe fighting took place; at length, after a series of
victories, gained mainly by the use of the bayonet, the British army
pushed on to Lahore, the capital, and the Sikhs surrendered
(1846).

Three years later they again rose; but after some further
engagements, their main army was routed with great slaughter by
Lord Gough, in the battle of Gujerat.

The territory of the Punjab was thereupon added to our Indian
empire.

The terrible famine which was passing over Ireland (1846-47), owing to
the failure of the potato crop, had to be dealt with by the ministry.
The sufferings of the Irish peasantry during this trying time were most
fearful; and sympathy was keenly aroused in this country.

Parliament voted large sums of money to relieve the distress as
much as possible, the government started public works to find
employment for the poor, and their efforts were nobly seconded by
the generosity of private individuals.

But so great had been the suffering that the population of Ireland was
reduced from eight to six millions during this period.

The measure for which Peel's ministry will always be famous was the Repeal
of the Corn-laws. The population of the country was rapidly increasing;
and as there were now more mouths to fill, it became more than ever
necessary to provide a cheap and plentiful supply of bread to fill
them.

For several years the nation had been divided into two parties on
this question.

Those who were in favour of protection for the British wheat-grower were
called Protectionists, while those who wished to abolish the corn-duties
styled themselves Free-traders.

In the year 1839 an Anti-Corn-law League had been formed for the
purpose of spreading free-trade doctrines among the people.

It had its headquarters at Manchester, and hence the statesmen who
took the leading part in it were frequently called the 'Manchester
Party.' There being no building at that time large enough to hold
the meetings in, a temporary wooden structure was erected, the site
of which is marked by the present Free-trade Hall. The guiding
spirit of the league was Richard Cobden, a cotton manufacturer,
who threw himself heart and soul into the cause.

He was assisted by many other able men, the chief of whom was the great
orator, John Bright. Branches of the league were soon established in
all the towns of the kingdom, and a paid body of lecturers was employed
to carry on the agitation and draw recruits into its ranks.

"An acquaintance?"

"A certain Colonel Darke--a charming person, general." And Mohun
laughed.

"I recognized him yonder when we charged on the hill, and, at first, he
followed his men when they broke. As I got close to him, however, in
the woods, he recognized me in turn, and we crossed swords. He is
brave--no man braver; and he did his utmost to put an end to me. I had
somewhat similar views myself in reference to my friend, the colonel,
but his men interposed and prevented my carrying them out. They were
all around me, slashing away. I was nearly cut out of the saddle--I was
carried away from my friend in the mêlée--and the unkindest cut of all
was his parting compliment as he retreated through the river."

"What was that, Mohun?"

"A bullet from his pistol, which grazed my shoulder. A mere scratch,
but provoking. I saw him grin as he fired."

"An old friend on the Yankee side? Well, that happens," said Stuart--

"Frequently, general," said Mohun; "and this one was _very_ dear,
indeed--most tenderly attached to me, I assure you. My affection for
him is of the same endearing nature: and we only crossed sabres in
jest--a mere fencing bout for amusement. We would not hurt each other
for worlds!"

And Mohun's mustache curled with laughter. There was something restless
and sinister in it.

Suddenly his face grew paler, and his eyes were half closed.

"Well, Mohun," said Stuart, who was not looking at him; "I am going to
send you across the river on a reconnaissance to-night."

"All right, general."

And the officer made the military salute. As he did so, he staggered,
and Stuart raised his eyes.

"You are wounded!" he exclaimed.

"A trifle," laughed Mohun.

But as he spoke, his frame tottered; his face assumed the hue of a
corpse; and he would have fallen, had not Miss Georgia Conway started
up unconsciously from the wounded man whom she was attending to, and
supported the officer in her arms.

Mohun opened his eyes, and a grim smile came to his pale face.

"A pretty tableau!" I heard him murmur; "it would do to put in a
romance. A cup of tea--or a pistol--that would finish--"

As he uttered these singular words, the blood gushed from his wounded
shoulder, his eyes closed, and, his head falling on the bosom of the
young girl, he fainted.


X.


THE SLIM ANIMAL.


Fleetwood was the first gun of the great campaign which culminated on
the heights of Gettysburg. A week afterward, Lee's columns were in
motion toward Pennsylvania.

Was that invasion the dictate of his own judgment? History will answer.
What is certain is, that the country, like the army, shouted "Forward!"
The people were ablaze with wild enthusiasm; the soldiers flushed with
the pride of their great victories of Fredericksburg and
Chancellorsville. The authorities at Richmond shared the excitement,
and the commissary-general, with unwonted humor, or in sober earnest,
indorsed, it is said, upon a requisition for supplies: "If General Lee
wishes rations, let him seek them in Pennsylvania."

I doubt if the great commander shared the general agitation. I think he
aimed to draw Hooker out of Virginia, leaving the rest to Providence.
So he moved toward the Potomac.

The world had called Lee cautious. After this invasion, that charge was
not repeated. From first to last audacity seemed the sentiment
inspiring him.

With Hooker on the Rappahannock, threatening Richmond, Lee thrust his
advance force under Ewell through the Blue Ridge toward Maryland;
pushed Longstreet up to Culpeper to support him, and kept only A.P.
Hill at Fredericksburg to bar the road to the Confederate capital.

Hooker wished to advance upon it, but President Lincoln forbade him.
The dispatch was a queer official document.

"In case you find Lee coming to the north of the Rappahannock," Lincoln
wrote, "I would by no means cross to the south of it. I would not take
any risk of being entangled upon the river, _like an ox jumped half
over a fence, and liable to be torn by dogs, front and rear, without a
fair chance to gore one way or kick the other._"

Ludicrous perhaps, but to the point; the "Rail-Splitter" was not always
dignified, but often judicious. Chancellorsville had been defeat--Lee's
assault, foreboded thus by Lincoln, would be death.

Hooker fell back, therefore, in the direction of Washington. Lee had
foreseen that fact, and had given himself small anxiety. His three
corps were already in full motion toward the Potomac; and suddenly the
thunder of artillery came on the winds of the mountains.

Ewell, the head of the Southern spear, was driving at Milroy, holding
Winchester. The struggle was brief. General Milroy had put the iron
heel on the poor valley; had oppressed the unfortunate people beyond
the power of words--and suddenly the hand of Fate clutched and shook
him to death. Ewell stormed his "Star Fort" near Winchester, with the
bayonet; drove him to headlong flight; got in rear of him, capturing
nearly all his command; and poor Milroy scarce managed to escape, with
a small body-guard, beyond the Potomac.

"In my opinion Milroy's men will fight better _under a soldier!_"

It was his commanding officer, Hooker, who wrote those words a few days
afterward. From the hands of his own general came that unkindest cut!

Exit Milroy, thus amid hisses and laughter--the hornet's nest at
Winchester was swept away--and Ewell headed straight for Pennsylvania.

Longstreet came up rapidly to fill the gap in the line--Hill followed
Longstreet--and then the world beheld the singular spectacle of an army
extended in a long skirmish line over a hundred miles, with another
army massed not daring to assail it.

Hooker did not see his "opening;" but Lincoln did. One of his
dispatches has been quoted--here is another as amusing and as
judicious.

"If the head of Lee's army is at Martinsburg," Lincoln wrote Hooker,
"and the tail of it on the Plank road, between Fredericksburg and
Chancellorsville, _the animal must be very slim somewhere--could you
not break him?_"

But Hooker could not. He did not even try. Lee's movements seemed to
paralyze him--his chief of staff wrote:--

"We cannot go boggling round, until we know what we are going after."

"Boggling round" exactly described the movements of Hooker. He was
still in a grand fog, and knew nothing of his adversary's intent, when
a terrific cry arose among the well-to-do farmers of Pennsylvania. The
wolf had appeared in the fold. Ewell was rapidly advancing upon
Harrisburg.

Behind came the veteran corps of Hill and Longstreet. The gorges of the
Blue Ridge were alive with bristling bayonets. Then the waters of the
Potomac splashed around the waists of the infantry and the wheels of
the artillery carriages. Soon the fields of Maryland and Pennsylvania
were alive with "rebels," come, doubtless, to avenge the outrages of
Pope and Milroy. Throughout those commonwealths--through Philadelphia,
New York, and Boston--rang the cry, "Lee is coming!"

To return to the cavalry. The horsemen of Stuart were going to move in
an eccentric orbit. These are my _memoirs_, reader, not a history of
the war; I describe only what I saw, and am going to ask you now, to
"follow the feather" of Stuart.

Stuart was promptly in the saddle, and when Lee began to move, advanced
north of the Rappahannock, drawing a cordon of cavalry across the roads
above Middleburg, to guard the approaches to the mountain.

The result was that the infantry defiled through the Blue Ridge without
Hooker's knowledge. He knew that something was going on, but there his
information terminated. The troopers of Stuart kept watch over fifteen
miles of front, and through this wall of sabres the Federal eye could
not pierce.

Stuart is regarded by many as only a brave "raider." It was on
occasions like this, however, that he performed his greatest services.
Everywhere he confronted the enemy in stubborn battle; and the work was
hard. It was fighting, fighting, fighting--now, as in 1862, when he
covered Lee's retreat after Sharpsburg. Day and night the cavalry had
no rest. The crack of carbines, the clash of sabres, and the roar of
cannon were incessant. It was a war of giants which Fauquier and
Loudoun saw in those days--and not until the rear of Lee's column had
nearly reached the Potomac, did General Hooker by a desperate effort
succeed in driving Stuart back.

In these pages I must leave that obstinate struggle undescribed. It was
full of romantic scenes, and illustrated by daring courage: but all is
lost to view in the lurid smoke of Gettysburg.

With one scene in the hurrying drama I shall pass to greater events.

But first, I beg to introduce to the reader a very singular personage,
who is destined to play an important part in the history I am writing.


XI.


NIGHTHAWK.


It was the night of the 20th of June, 1863. Stuart's head-quarters had
been established in a house on the roadside above Middleburg.

We had been fighting all day; had returned only at nightfall: and I was
exchanging a few words with Stuart, before following the staff to rest,
when all at once a third personage, who seemed to have arisen from the
floor, stood before us.

His presence was so sudden and unexpected that I started. Then I looked
at him, curiously.

He was a man of about forty, thin, wiry, and with a nose resembling the
beak of a bird of prey. His eyes, half buried under bushy eyebrows,
twinkled like two stars. His mouth was large and smiling; his
expression exceedingly benignant. From the face I passed to the
costume. The worthy was clad in severe black, with a clerical white
cravat: wore a black beaver hat of the "stove-pipe" order; and
presented the appearance of a pious and peaceable civilian--almost that
of a clergyman, smiling benignantly upon all around him.

Stuart uttered an exclamation of satisfaction.

"Ah! Nighthawk, here you are!" he said.

And turning to me he introduced the new comer as "Mr. Nighthawk, one of
my 'private friends,' and true as steel."

Mr. Nighthawk bowed with an air of smiling respect--of benignant
sweetness.

"I am glad to know you, colonel, and hope I may have an opportunity of
being of service to you some day," he said.

The voice was low, soft, and accorded with the mild expression of the
countenance.

"Well, what news, Nighthawk?" asked Stuart; "experience tells me that
you have something of importance to communicate?"

"Ah, general!"

"Yes. You pass in the cavalry by the name of the 'man before the
battle,' for you always turn up then."

Mr. Nighthawk smiled.

"I try to give you information, general; and perhaps I have some news.
But first of my visits to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington, where I saw many of our friends."

And in his low, quiet voice Mr. Nighthawk, who had taken a seat and
smoothed down his white cravat, proceeded to speak of his travels and
what he had seen.

The narrative astounded me. He spoke without reserve, for General
Stuart had informed him that he might do so before me; and I was
startled to find the number of private friends the South had in the
North. Mr. Nighthawk was evidently _au fait_ at his trade. He had a
perfect understanding plainly with persons of the highest political
position; and Stuart listened with the greatest interest to the
speaker, whose low voice never rose above the half-whisper by which I
had been impressed on his first opening his lips.

"So the summing up of all this," said Stuart, "that our friends are not
too hopeful?"

"They are not, general."

"They say Lee must win a great victory on the soil of Pennsylvania?"

"Yes, general. Without it there is no hope of peace, they declare."

"Well, I think they are right; and that we shall gain the victory."

Mr. Nighthawk made no reply; and Stuart reflected for some moments
without speaking. Then rousing himself:--

"I forgot," he said. "You have not given me your special information,
Nighthawk."

The worthy smiled.

"You know I am the 'man before the battle,' general?"

"Yes, go on, Nighthawk."

"I have just left General Hooker's head-quarters."

"Where are they?"

"Beyond Centreville."

"You saw him?"

"I conversed with him."

"Ah!"

"An hour, general, as the Rev. Mr. Ward, from Massachusett, of the
'Grand Union Sanitary Commission'."

And Mr. Nighthawk smiled.

"Of course I urged active movements, and General Hooker became quite
animated."

"He agreed with your views then?" said Stuart, laughing.

"Perfectly, general."

"And he intends--"

"There is the important thing. While we were conversing, General Hooker
was called for a moment out of his tent, and by accident, my eyes fell
upon an order which lay upon his desk."

"An order?"

"For two divisions of cavalry, one of infantry, and a full complement
of artillery, to advance and drive you back to the mountain."

"Ah! you saw that order?"

"I did, general; it was just ready to be sent."

"What day did it fix?"

"To-morrow, general."

"Ah, indeed! Two divisions of infantry and one of cavalry?"

Mr. Nighthawk inclined in assent.

"When did you leave Hooker's head-quarters?"

"This afternoon."

"And you came through the lines to-night?"

"Yes, general, in the usual way, by passing through the pickets. I was
on foot and nothing was easier."

Stuart knit his brows and reflected. Then he called to the orderly.

"Wake the adjutant-general, and have three couriers ready at once!"

Mr. Nighthawk arose.

"By-the-by, general," he said, "I saw Swartz, whom I have mentioned to
you."

"Yes; the best spy, you say, in the Federal army."

"I think he is, general. He is a wonderful man. He recently played a
trick upon you."

"Upon _me_?"

"At least he bore off a prisoner from you. It was a lady, captured by
Colonel Mohun, one night on the Rappahannock."

[Illustration: Massacre at Cawnpore.]

CHAPTER VI.

The Indian Mutiny, 1857-58--Cause of the Mutiny--Massacre of
Cawnpore--Relief of Lucknow--The Queen's Letter to Lord Canning.

Exactly one hundred years after Clive had laid the foundation of
our empire in India by the victory of Plassey, events occurred in
that country which completely cast into the shade the tragic incident
of the 'Black Hole' of Calcutta.

During the century which had elapsed since the days of Clive, the British
power had been extended, till nearly the whole of the great peninsula
from the Himalaya Mountains to Cape Comorin was subject to our sway.

A native army had been formed, which far outnumbered the British force
maintained there. The loyalty of these sepoy troops had not hitherto
been suspected; and in fact they had frequently given proofs of
their fidelity in the frontier wars.

Unsuspected by the officers, a spirit of discontent had been gradually
spreading among the sepoy regiments.

An impression had become prevalent among them that the British government
intended forcing them to give up their ancient faith and become
Christians.

Just about this time, the new Enfield rifle was distributed among them
in place of the old 'brown Bess.' The cartridges intended for this
weapon were greased; and as the ends of them had to be bitten off
before use, the sepoys fancied that the fat of the cow--an animal
they had been taught to consider sacred--had been purposely used
in order to degrade them, and make them lose caste.

The fierce temper of the sepoys was now thoroughly roused, and a general
mutiny took place.

It commenced at Meerut, where the native troops rose against their
officers, and put them to death, and then took possession of the
ancient city of Delhi, which remained in their hands for some months.

The rebellion quickly spread to other towns, and for a short time
a great portion of the north and centre of India was in the power
of the rebels.

Wherever they got the upper hand, they were guilty of shocking deeds
of cruelty upon the Europeans.

The British troops which were stationed in different places offered
the most heroic resistance to the rebels, and the mutiny was at
length suppressed.

Of all the incidents of that terrible year, two stand out in bold
relief, on account of the thrilling interest attaching to them.

These are the massacre of Cawnpore and the relief of Lucknow.
Cawnpore, which was in the heart of the disaffected area, contained
about a thousand Europeans, of whom two-thirds were women and
children.

The defensive post into which they had thrown themselves at the
beginning of the outbreak was speedily surrounded by an overwhelming
number of the mutineers, led on by the infamous Nana Sahib.

The few defenders held out bravely for a time, but at last surrendered
on a promise of being allowed to depart in safety. The sepoys accompanied
them to the river-side, but as soon as the men were on board the boats,
a murderous fire was opened upon them, and only one man escaped.

The women and children, being reserved for a still more cruel fate,
were carried back to Cawnpore.

Hearing that General Havelock was approaching with a body of troops
for the relief of the place, Nana Sahib marched out to intercept
him, but was driven back.

Smarting under this defeat, he returned to Cawnpore, and gave
directions for the instant massacre of his helpless prisoners.

His orders were promptly carried out by his troops, under circumstances
of the most shocking cruelty.

Shortly afterwards, Havelock and his little army arrived, but only to
find, to their unutterable grief, that they were too late to rescue
their unfortunate countrywomen and their children.

[Illustration: Relief of Lucknow.]
Havelock now marched to the relief of Lucknow, where the British
garrison, under Sir Henry Lawrence, was surrounded by thousands
of the rebels.

Havelock encountered the enemy over and over again on his march, and
inflicted defeat upon them. Step by step, our men fought their way
into the fort at Lucknow, where, if they could not relieve their
friends, they could remain and die with them. But this was not to be.
Another deliverer with a stronger force was coming swiftly up; and
very soon the ears of the anxious defenders were gladdened by the
martial sound of the bagpipes, playing 'The Campbells are coming;' and
shortly afterwards, Sir Colin Campbell and his gallant Highlanders--the
victors of Balaklava--were grasping the hands of their brother
veterans, who were thus at length relieved. The brave Lawrence had died
from his wounds before Sir Colin arrived, and Havelock only survived
a few weeks.

He lived long enough, however, to see that by his heroic efforts
he had upheld Britain's power in her darkest moment; and that her
forces were now coming on with irresistible might, to complete the
work which he had so gallantly begun.

The power of the rebels in that quarter was now broken.

In Central India Sir Hugh Rose had been equally successful; and the
heroic deeds of the British troops in suppressing the revolt cannot
be better described than in the words of this general, in addressing
his soldiers after the triumph was achieved: 'Soldiers, you have
marched more than a thousand miles and taken more than a hundred
guns; you have forced your way through mountain-passes and intricate
jungles, and over rivers; you have captured the strongest forts,
and beat the enemy, no matter what the odds, wherever you met them;
you have restored extensive districts to the government; and peace
and order now reign where before for twelve months were tyranny and
rebellion.'

This rising led to an alteration in the government of India.

The old East India Company was abolished, and its power transferred
to the crown, which is represented in parliament by a secretary of state,
and in India by a viceroy. More recently the Queen received the title
of Empress of India.

When the mutiny was quelled, nobody deprecated more than the Queen
did the vindictiveness with which a certain section of the English
people desired to treat all the countrymen of the military mutineers
whose reported atrocities had roused their indignation.

The Queen wrote to Lord Canning that she shared 'his feelings of sorrow
and indignation at the unchristian spirit shown towards Indians in general
and towards sepoys without discrimination.... To the nation at large--to
the peaceable inhabitants--to the many kind and friendly natives who
have assisted us, sheltered the fugitives, and been faithful and
true--there should be shown the greatest kindness....

The greatest wish on their Queen's part is to see them happy, contented,
and flourishing.'

CHAPTER VII.

Marriage of the Princess Royal--Carriage Accident--Twenty-first Anniversary
of Wedding-day--Death of the Prince-Consort.

Meanwhile a domestic incident had made a great change in the royal
family.
The Princess Royal had become engaged to Prince Frederick-William of
Prussia (for three months Emperor of Germany), and the marriage came
off on the 25th of January 1858. It was the first break in the home
circle.

The Queen recorded it in her diary as 'the second most eventful day in
my life as regards feelings.' Before the wedding, the Queen and her
daughter were photographed together, but the Queen 'trembled so,
that her likeness came out indistinct.'

The correspondence between the mother and her daughter began and
continued, close and confidential, full of trusting affection and
solicitous wisdom.

[Illustration: Prince-Consort.]

On November 9, 1858, the Prince of Wales celebrated his eighteenth
birthday.

Mr Greville in his journal tells us that on that occasion the
Queen wrote her son 'one of the most admirable letters that ever
were penned.'

She told him that he may have thought the rule they adopted for his
education a severe one, but that his welfare was their only object,
and well knowing to what seductions of flattery he would eventually
be exposed, they wished to prepare and strengthen his mind against
them; that he must now consider himself his own master, and that
they should never intrude any advice upon him, although always ready
to counsel him whenever he thought fit to attend.

This was a very long letter, which the prince received with a feeling
that proved the wisdom which dictated it.

In 1860, while travelling with the Queen in Germany, the Prince-Consort
met with a severe carriage accident, his comparative escape from
which left the Queen full of happy thanksgiving, though, as she
herself says, 'when she feels most deeply, she always appears
calmest.'

But, she added, she 'could not rest without doing something to mark
permanently her feelings.

In times of old,' she considered, 'a church or a monument would
probably have been erected on the spot.' But her desire was to do something
which might benefit her fellow-creatures.

The outgrowth of this true impulse of the Queen's was the establishment
of the 'Victoria Stift' at Coburg, whereby sums of money are applied
in apprenticing worthy young men or in purchasing tools for them,
and in giving dowries to deserving young women or otherwise settling
them in life.

In the course of the same year the Queen's second daughter, Princess
Alice, afterwards the friend and companion of her mother's first
days of widowhood, was betrothed to Prince Louis of Hesse.

In February 1861, the Queen and the Prince-Consort kept the twenty-first
anniversary of their wedding-day--'a day which has brought us,'
says the Queen, 'and I may say, to the world at large, such
incalculable blessings.

Very few can say with me,' she adds, 'that their husband at the end of
twenty-one years is not only full of the friendship, kindness, and
affection which a truly happy marriage brings with it, but of the
same tender love as in the very first days of our marriage.'

The Prince-Consort wrote to the aged Duchess of Kent, 'You have, I trust,
found good and loving children in us, and we have experienced
nothing but love and kindness from you.'
Alas!

it was the death of that beloved mother which was to cast the first
of the many shadows which have since fallen upon the royal home.

The duchess died, after a slight illness, rather suddenly at last, the
Queen and the prince reaching her side too late for any recognition.
It was a terrible blow to the Queen: she wrote to her uncle Leopold
that she felt 'truly orphaned.'

Her sister, the Princess Hohenlohe, daughter of the Duchess of Kent by
her first marriage, could not come to England at the time, but
wrote letters full of sympathy and inspiration; yet Her Majesty
became very nervous, and was inclined to shrink into solitude, even
from her children, and to find comfort nowhere but with the beloved
consort who was himself so soon to be taken from her.

The great blow which made the royal lady a widow, and deprived the whole
country of the throne's wisest and most disinterested counsellor,
came on the 14th of December 1861.

In the year 1861, what with public and private anxieties, the prince felt
ill and feverish, and miserable. He passed his last birthday on a visit
to Ireland, where the Prince of Wales was serving in the camp at
the Curragh of Kildare.

From Ireland, the Queen, the prince, Prince Alfred, and the Princesses
Alice and Helena went to Balmoral; and there the prince enjoyed his
favourite pastime of deer-stalking. On the return to Windsor in October,
the Queen began to be anxious about her husband.

One of the last letters of the prince was to his daughter the Crown
Princess of Prussia, on her twenty-first birthday, and it shows the
noble spirit which animated his whole career. 'May your life, which has
begun beautifully, expand still further to the good of others and the
contentment of your own mind!

True inward happiness is to be sought only in the internal consciousness
of effort systematically devoted to good and useful ends. Success,
indeed, depends upon the blessing which the Most High sees meet
to vouchsafe to our endeavours.

May this success not fail you, and may your outward life leave you
unhurt by the storms to which the sad heart so often looks forward
with a shrinking dread.'

In conversation with the Queen, he seemed to have a presentiment
that he had not long to live.

'I do not cling to life; you do, but I set no store by it. If I knew
that those I love were well cared for, I should be quite ready to die
to-morrow....

I am sure, if I had a severe illness, I should give up at once. I
should not struggle for life.'

The fatigue and exposure which he underwent on a visit to Sandhurst
to inspect the buildings for the Staff College and Royal Military
Hospital, there is no doubt, injured his delicate health.

Next Sunday he was full of rheumatic pains; he had already suffered
greatly from rheumatism during the previous fortnight. One of his last
services to his country was to write a memorandum in connection
with the _Trent_ complications; which suggestions were adopted by
British ministers and forwarded to the United States. He attended
church on Sunday, 1st December, but looked very ill.
Dr Jenner was sent for, and for the next few days he grew worse,
with symptoms of gastric or low fever.

Another account says: 'The anxious Queen, still bowed down by the
remembrance of the recent death of her mother, the Duchess of Kent,
went through her state duties as one "in a dreadful dream."

Sunday, the 8th, saw the prince in a more dangerous condition. Of this
day one of the Queen's household, in a letter written shortly afterwards,
says: "The last Sunday Prince Albert passed on earth was a very blessed
one for Princess Alice to look back upon.

He was very weak and very ill, and she spent the afternoon alone with
him while the others were at church.

He begged to have the sofa drawn to the window that he might see
the sky and the clouds sailing past.

He then asked her to play to him, and she went through several of his
favourite hymns and chorales.

After she had played some time she looked round and saw him lying
back, his hands folded as if in prayer, and his eyes shut.

He lay so long without moving that she thought he had fallen asleep.
Presently he looked up and smiled.

She said, 'Were you asleep, dear papa?' 'Oh no!' he answered; 'only I
have such sweet thoughts.'

During his illness his hands were often folded in prayer; and when
he did not speak, his serene face showed that the 'sweet thoughts'
were with him to the end."

'On the afternoon of Saturday, the 14th of December, it was evident
that the end was near.

"_Gutes Frauchen_" ("Good little wife") were his last loving words
to the Queen as he kissed her and then rested his head upon her
shoulder.

A little while afterwards the Queen bent over him and said, "_Es ist
kleins Frauchen_" ("It is little wife"); the prince evidently knew her,
although he could not speak, and bowed his head in response.
Without apparent suffering he quietly sank to rest, and towards
eleven o'clock it was seen that the soul had left its earthly
tabernacle.

The well-known hymn beginning--

Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee,
had been the favourite of Prince Albert in his last illness. His
physician expressed one day the hope that he would be better in a
few days; but the prince replied, "No, I shall not recover, but I
am not taken by surprise; _ I am not afraid, I trust I am prepared
_."

'When the end came' (we quote the beautiful words of the
biographer) 'in the solemn hush of that mournful chamber there was
such grief as has rarely hallowed any death-bed.

A great light, which had blessed the world, and which the mourners had
but yesterday hoped might long bless it, was waning fast away.

A husband, a father, a friend, a master, endeared by every quality by
which man in such relations can win the love of his fellow-men,
was passing into the silent land, and his loving glance, his wise
counsels, his firm, manly thought should be known among them no more.

The castle clock chimed the third quarter after ten. Calm and peaceful
grew the beloved form; the features settled into the beauty of a
perfectly serene repose; two or three long but gentle breaths were
drawn; and that great soul had fled to seek a nobler scope for its
aspirations in the world within the veil, for which it had often
yearned, where there is rest for the weary, and where the "spirits
of the just are made perfect."'

The funeral took place on the 23d December, at Frogmore, and the Prince
of Wales was the chief mourner.

The words on the coffin were as follow: 'Here lies the most
illustrious and exalted Albert, Prince-Consort, Duke of Saxony,
Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Knight of the most noble Order
of the Garter, the most beloved husband of the most august and
potent Queen Victoria.

He died on the 14th day of December 1861, in the forty-third year
of his age.'

A Prince indeed, Beyond all titles, and a household name, Hereafter,
through all time, Albert the Good.

On that sad Christmas which followed the prince's death the usual festivities
were omitted in the royal household, and the nation mourned in
unison with the Queen for the great and good departed.

It has been well said by a distinguished writer that it was only
'since his death, and chiefly since the Queen's own generous and tender
impulse prompted her to make the nation the confidant of her own
great love and happiness, that the Prince-Consort has had full
justice....

Perhaps, if truth were told, he was too uniformly noble, too high above
all soil and fault, to win the fickle popular admiration, which
is more caught by picturesque irregularity than by the higher
perfections of a wholly worthy life.'

CHAPTER VIII.

The Queen in Mourning--Death of Princess Alice--Illness of Prince of
Wales--The Family of the Queen--Opening of Indian Exhibition and Imperial
Institute--Jubilee--Jubilee Statue--Death of Duke of Clarence--Address
to the Nation on the marriage of Princess May.

Henceforth the great Queen was 'written widow,' and while striving
nobly in her loneliness to fulfil those public functions, in which
she had hitherto been so faithfully companioned, she shrank at first
from courtly pageantry and from the gay whirl of London life, and lived
chiefly in the quiet homes which she had always loved best, at Osborne
and Balmoral. When she has come out among her people, it has chiefly
been for the sake of some public benefit for the poor and the
suffering.

At times there have been murmurs against the Queen for failing in
her widowhood to maintain the gaieties and extravagances of an
open court in the capital of her dominions.

It was said that 'trade was bad therefore,' and times of depression and
want of employment were attributed to this cause. The nation is
growing wiser. It is seen that true prosperity does not consist merely
in the quick circulation of money--above all, certainly not in the
transference of wealth gained from the tillers of the soil to the
classes which minister solely to vanity and luxury.

A few months after her father's death, the Princess Alice married
her betrothed, Prince Louis, and since her own death (on the same
day of the year as her father's) in the year 1878, we have had an
opportunity of looking into the royal household from the point of
view of a daughter and a sister.

The Prince-Consort's death-bed made a very close tie between the Queen
and the Princess Alice, who herself had a full share of womanly
sorrow in her comparatively short life, and the tone of perfect
self-abnegation which pervades her letters is very touching. On that
fatal 14th December 1878, the first of the Queen's children was
taken from her.

The Princess Alice fell a victim to her kind-hearted care while
nursing those of her family ill with diphtheria.

Her last inquiries were about poor and sick people in her little
capital.

And the day before she died, she expressed to Sir William Jenner
her regret that she should cause her mother so much anxiety.

The Queen in a letter thanked her subjects for their sympathy with
her loss of a dear child, who was 'a bright example of loving
tenderness, courageous devotion, and self-sacrifice to duty.'

In 1863, on the 10th of March, the Prince of Wales married the Princess
Alexandra of Denmark, and in 1871, when the fatal date, the 14th of
December came round, he lay at the point of death, suffering precisely
as his father had done. But his life was spared, and in the following
spring, accompanied by the Queen and by his young wife, and in the
presence of all the power, the genius, and the rank of the realm,
he made solemn thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral.

On the 3rd November 1871, Mr H.

M.

Stanley, a young newspaper correspondent, succeeded in finding Dr
Livingstone.

This was but the beginning of greater enterprises, for, catching the
noble enthusiasm which characterised Livingstone, Stanley afterwards
crossed the Dark Continent, and revealed the head-waters of the
Congo.

Again he plunged into Africa and succoured Emin Pasha, whose death
was announced in the autumn of 1893.

To Mr Stanley, Lord Granville, then Foreign Secretary, sent the present
of a gold snuff-box set with diamonds, and the following letter:
'Sir--I have great satisfaction in conveying to you, by command of
the Queen, Her Majesty's high appreciation of the prudence and
zeal which you have displayed in opening a communication with Dr
Livingstone, relieving Her Majesty from the anxiety which, in common
with her subjects, she had felt in regard to the fate of that
distinguished traveller. The Queen desires me to express her thanks
for the service you have thus rendered, together with Her Majesty's
congratulations on your having so successfully carried out the
mission which you so fearlessly undertook.'

The most notable events of the year 1873 were the death of the
Emperor Napoleon III. in his exile at Chiselhurst, and the visit of
the Shah of Persia, who was received by Her Majesty in state at Windsor.
The Prince of Wales made almost a royal tour through India in 1875-76,
and early in the following year witnessed the proclamation of the
Queen as Empress of India.

In 1886 the Queen opened the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at Kensington,
the results of which, financially and otherwise, were highly satisfactory.

I had drawn my sword,
but before I could go to Stuart's assistance, Tom shot ahead of me.

He came just in time. Two of the enemy had caught up with Stuart, and
were making furious cuts at him. He parried the blow of one of the
Federal cavalry-men--and the other fell from the saddle, throwing up
his hands as he did so. Tom Herbert had placed his pistol on his
breast, and shot him through the heart.

But by this time the rest had reached us. A sabre flashed above Tom's
head; fell, cutting him out of the saddle nearly; and he would have
dropped from it, had I not passed my arm around him.

In another instant, all three would have been killed or captured. But
the firing had given the alarm. A thunder of hoofs was heard: a
squadron of our cavalry dashed over the hill: in three minutes the
enemy were flying, to escape the edge of the sabre.

Stuart led the charge, and seemed to enjoy it with the zest of a
fox-hunter. He had indeed escaped from a critical danger. He had pushed
on with a few of his staff, as I have said, to Fairfax Station, had
then stopped and slipped his bridle to allow his horse to eat some
"Yankee oats," and while standing beside the animal, had been suddenly
charged by the party of Federal cavalry, coming down on a
reconnaissance from the direction of the Court-House. So sudden was
their appearance that he was nearly "gobbled up." He had leaped on the
unbridled horse; seized the halter, and fled at full speed. The enemy
had pursued him; he had declined halting--and the reader has seen the
sequel.[1]

[Footnote 1: Real.]

Stuart pressed the party hotly toward Sanxter's, but they
escaped--nearly capturing on the way, however, a party of officers at a
blacksmith's shop. The general came back in high good humor. The chase
seemed to have delighted him.

"Bully for old Tom Herbert!" he exclaimed. "You ought to have seen him
when they were cutting at him, and spoiling his fine new satchel!"

Tom Herbert did not seem to participate in the general's mirth. He was
examining the satchel which a sabre stroke had nearly cut in two.

"What are you looking at?" asked Stuart.

"This hole, general," replied Tom, uttering a piteous sigh.

"Well, it is a trifle."

"It is a serious matter, general."

"You have lost something?"

"Yes."

"What?"

"A joint of my new flute."

And Tom Herbert's expression was so melancholy that Stuart burst into
laughter.

"You may have lost your flute, Tom," he said, leaning on his shoulder,
"but you have won your spurs at least, in the cavalry!"

DROWSYLAND.


At daylight, on the next morning, Stuart had crossed the Potomac into
Maryland.

He had advanced from Wolf Run Shoals to Fairfax Court House, where the
men rifled the sutlers' shops of tobacco, figs, white gloves, straw
hats, and every edible and wearable:--then the column pushed on toward
Seneca Falls, where the long wavering line of horsemen might have been
seen hour after hour crossing the moonlit river, each man, to prevent
wetting, holding above his head a shot or shell taken from the
caissons. Then the artillery was dragged through: the panting horses
trotted on, and the first beams of day saw the long column of Stuart
ready to advance on its perilous pathway to the Susquehanna, by the
route between the Federal army and Washington.

The word was given, and with the red flags fluttering, Stuart moved
toward Rockville, unopposed, save by a picket, which was driven off by
the advance guard. Without further incident, he then pushed on, and
entered the town in triumph.

A charming reception awaited him. The place was thoroughly Southern;
and the passage of the cavalry was greeted with loud cheers. Unbounded
was the delight, above all, of a seminary of young girls. Their first
attempt was directed against not the British lines, with the

It was repulsed, however, chiefly by Sir the Russians were from the.'It

and much suffering was endured during the long dreary. When tidings of
these misfortunes reached England to there was much.
But Stuart
determined not to abandon them, and they were dragged on--a line
stretched to infinity!

Thenceforth, dear reader, the march was a sort of dream to me. How can
I relate my adventures--the numerous spectacles and events of the time?
I know not even now if they were events or mere dreams, seeing that,
all the long way, I was half asleep in the saddle! It was a veritable
Drowsyland that we moved through on horseback! The Dutchmen, the
"fraus," the "spreading," the sauer-kraut--the conestogas, the red
barns, the guttural voices, the strange faces--were these actual
things, or the mere fancies of a somnambulist? Was I an officer of real
cavalry making a real march; or a fanciful being, one of a long column
of phantoms?

I seem dimly to remember a pretty face, whose owner smiled on me--and a
faint memory remains of a supper which she gave me. If I am not
mistaken I was left alone in the town of Salem--hostile faces were
around me--and I was falling asleep when Hampton's cavalry came up.

I think, then, I rode on with him--having been left to direct him. That
we talked about horses, and the superiority of "blood" in animals; that
at dawn, Hampton said, "I am perishing for sleep!" and that we lay
down, side by side, near a haystack.

All that is a sort of phantasmagoria, and others were no better than
myself. Whole columns went to sleep, in the saddle, as they rode along;
and General Stuart told me afterward, that he saw a man attempt to
climb over a fence, half succeed only, and go to sleep on the top rail!

Some day I promise myself the pleasure of travelling in Pennsylvania.
It possesses all the attractions to me of a world seen in a dream!

But after that good sleep, side by side with the great Carolinian,
things looked far more real, and pushing on I again caught up with
Stuart.

He advanced steadily on Carlisle, and in the afternoon we heard
artillery from the south.

I looked at my military map, and calculated the distance. The result
was that I said:--

"General, those guns are at a place called Gettysburg on this map."

"Impossible!" was his reply. "They can not be fighting there. You are
certainly wrong."

But I was right.

Those guns were the signal of the "First day's fight at Gettysburg."


XIX


CARLISLE BY FIRELIGHT.


It can not be said that we accomplished very enormous results at
Carlisle. The enemy defended it bravely.

Stuart sent in a flag, demanding a surrender: this proposition was
politely declined; and for fear that there might possibly remain some
doubts on the subject, the Federal commander of the post, opened with
artillery upon the gray cavalry.

That was the signal for a brisk fight, and a magnificent spectacle
also.

As soon as the enemy's response to the flag of truce had been received,
Stuart advanced his sharp-shooters, replied with his artillery to their
own, and dispatched a party to destroy the extensive United States
barracks, formerly used as cantonments for recruits to the army.

In ten minutes the buildings were wrapped in flames; and the city of
Carlisle was illumined magnificently. The crimson light of the
conflagration revealed every house, the long lines of trees, and made
the delicate church spires, rising calmly aloft, resemble shafts of
rose-tinted marble.

I recall but one scene which was equally picturesque--the "doomed city"
of Fredericksburg, on the night of December 11, 1862, when the church
spires were illumined by the burning houses, as those of Carlisle were
in June, 1863.

So much for this new "Siege of Carlisle." Here my description ends. It
was nothing--a mere picture. An hour afterward Stuart ceased firing,
the conflagration died down; back into the black night sank the fair
town of Carlisle, seen then for the first and the last time by this
historian.

The guns were silent, the cavalry retired; and Stuart, accompanied by
his staff, galloped back to a great deserted house where he established
his temporary head-quarters.

On the bold face there was an expression of decided ill-humor. He had
just received a dispatch, by courier, from General Lee.

That dispatch said, "Come, I need you urgently here," and the "here" in
question, was Gettysburg, at least twenty miles distant. Now, with
worn-out men and horses, twenty miles was a serious matter. Stuart's
brows were knit, and he mused gloomily.

Suddenly he turned and addressed me.

"You were right, Surry," he said, "those guns were at Gettysburg. This
dispatch, sent this morning, reports the enemy near there."

I bowed; Stuart reflected for some moments without speaking. Then he
suddenly said:--

"I wish you would go to General Lee, and say I am coming, Surry. How is
your horse?"

"Worn-out, general, but I can get another."

"Good; tell General Lee that I will move at once to Gettysburg, with
all my force, and as rapidly as possible!"

"I will lose no time, general."

And saluting, I went out.

From the captured horses I selected the best one I could find, and
burying the spurs in his sides, set out through the black night.


XX.


THE HOUSE BETWEEN CARLISLE AND GETTYSBURG.


You know when you set out, the proverb says, but you know not when you
will arrive.

I left Carlisle, breasting the night, on the road to Gettysburg, little
thinking that a curious incident was to occur to me upon the way--an
incident closely connected with the destinies of some personages who
play prominent parts in this history.

I had ridden on for more than an hour, through the darkness, keeping a
good look-out for the enemy, whose scouting parties of cavalry were
known to be prowling around, when all at once, my horse, who was going
at full speed, struck his foot against a sharp point of rock, cropping
out from the surface.

The animal stumbled, recovered himself, and went on as rapidly as
before. A hundred yards further his speed relaxed; then he began to
limp painfully; then in spite of every application of the spur I could
not force him out of a slow limping trot.

It was truly unfortunate. I was the bearer of an important message, and
was surrounded by enemies. The only chance was to pass through them,
under shadow of the darkness; with light they would perceive me, and my
capture be certain.

A hundred yards further, and I found I must decide at once upon the
course to pursue. My horse seemed about to fall. At every stroke of the
spur he groaned piteously, and his limp had become a stagger.

I looked around through the trees, and at the distance of a quarter of
a mile I saw the glimmer of a light. To obtain another horse was
indispensable under the circumstances; and looking to see that my
revolver was loaded and capped, I forced my tottering animal toward the
mansion in which the light glimmered.

My design was simply to proceed thither, "impress" a fresh horse at the
pistol's muzzle; throw my saddle upon him; leave my own animal, and
proceed on my way.

Pushing across the fields, and dismounting to let down the fences which
my limping animal could not leap, I soon approached the light. It shone
through the window of a house of some size, with ornamental grounds
around it, and apparently the abode of a man of means.

At fifty paces from it I dismounted and tethered my horse in the shadow
of some trees. A brief reconnaissance under the circumstances was
advisable; and approaching the mansion silently, without allowing my
sabre to make any clatter, I gained the long portico in front, and went
to a window reaching down to the flooring of the verandah.

Through the half-closed venetians I could see into a large apartment,
half library, half sitting-room, as the easy chairs, mantel ornaments,
desks, and book-cases showed. On the centre-table burned a brilliant
lamp--and by its light I witnessed a spectacle which made me draw back
in the shadow of the shutter, and rivet my eyes on the interior.

I confess I shared the general sentiment. That strange intoxication was
contagious, and I was drunk like the rest with the thought of triumph.
That triumph would open to us the gates of Washington and bring peace.
The North scarcely denied that then--though they may deny it to-day.
The whole country was completely weary of the war. There seemed to be
no hope of compelling the South to return to the Union. A victory over
Meade, opening the whole North to Lee, promised a treaty of peace. The
day had arrived, apparently when the army of Northern Virginia, musket
in hand, was about to dictate the terms of that document.

"Lee has only to slip the leash," I thought, as I gazed at the army,
"and these war-dogs will tear down their prey!"

Alas! they tore it, but were torn too! they did all at Gettysburg that
any troops could do.

What was impossible, was beyond even their strength.


CHAPTER XXV.


THE WRESTLE FOR ROUND TOP HILL.


From the morning of the second of July to the evening of the third, the
fields south of Gettysburg were one great scene of smoke, dust, uproar,
blood; of columns advancing and returning; cannon thundering; men
shouting, yelling, cheering, and dying; blue mingled with gray in
savage and unrelenting battle.

In that smoke-cloud, with the ears deafened, you saw or heard little
distinctly. But above the confused struggle rose two great incidents,
which on successive days decided every thing.

The first of them was Longstreet's assault on the enemy's left wing, in
front of Round Top Hill.

Lee had displayed excellent soldiership in determining upon this
movement, and it will be seen that it came within an inch of success.
Standing upon Seminary Range, near his centre, he had reconnoitered
General Meade's position through his field-glass, with great attention;
and this examination revealed the fact that the Federal line was
projected forward in a salient in front of Round Top Hill, a jagged and
almost inaccessible peak, near which rested General Meade's extreme
left.

If this weak point could be carried, "it appeared" said Lee, "that its
possession would give facilities for assailing and carrying the more
elevated ground and crest beyond."

As to the importance of that crest--namely Round Top Hill--hear General
Meade:--

"If they had succeeded in occupying that, it would have prevented me
from holding any of the ground which I subsequently held to the last."

Lee determined to attack the salient, making at the same time a heavy
demonstration--or a real assault--upon the Federal right, opposite
Ewell.

All his preparations were not made until the afternoon. Then suddenly,
Longstreet's artillery opened its thunders.

At that moment the spectacle was grand. The heights, the slopes, the
fields, and the rugged crest opposite, were enveloped in smoke and fire
from the bursting shell. The sombre roar ascended like the bellowing of
a thousand bulls, leaped back from the rocks, and rolled away, in wild
echoes through the hills. All the furies seemed let loose, and yet this
was only the preface.

At four in the evening the thunder dropped to silence, and along the
lines of Hood and McLaws, which formed the charging column, ran a wild
cheer, which must have reached the ears of the enemy opposite.

That cheer told both sides that the moment had come. The word was
given, and Longstreet hurled his column at the blue line occupying a
peach-orchard in his front.

The blow was aimed straight at the salient in the Federal line, and in
spite of a brave resistance it was swept away; McLaws advancing rapidly
toward the high ground in its rear. At one blow the whole left wing of
General Meade's army seemed thrown into irretrievable confusion, and
Hood pressing forward on McLaws's right, hastened to seize upon the
famous Round Top, from which he would be able to hurl his thunder upon
the flank and rear of the Federal line of battle.

The scene, like the conflict which now took place, was wild and
singular. The crest of Round Top Hill was a mass of rock, which rose
abruptly from the rough and jagged slope. It was unoccupied--for the
sudden overthrow of the force in front of it had not been
anticipated--and one headlong rush on the part of Hood alone seemed
necessary to give him possession of the real key of the whole position.

Hood saw that at a glance, and dashed up the slope at the head of his
men. It was scarcely an order of battle which his troops presented at
this moment. But one thought burned in every heart. The men swarmed up
the hill-side; the woods gave back the rolling thunder of their cheers;
already the Southern battle-flags carried by the foremost were
fluttering on the crest.

The mass rushed toward the red flags; for an instant the gray figures
were seen erect upon the summit--then a sudden crash of musketry
resounded--and a mad struggle began with a Federal brigade which had
hastened to the spot.

This force, it is said, was hurried up by General Warren, who finding
the Federal signal-officers about to retire, ordered them, to remain
and continue waving their flags to the last; and then, seizing on the
first brigade he could find, rushed them up the slope to the crest.

They arrived just in time. Hood's men were swarming on the crest. A
loud cheer arose, but all at once they found themselves face to face
with a line of bayonets, while beyond were seen confused and struggling
masses, dragging up cannon.

What followed was a savage grapple rather than an ordinary conflict.
Only a small part of Hood's force had reached the summit, and this was
assailed by a whole brigade. The fight was indescribable. All that the
eye could make out for some moments in the dust and smoke, was a
confused mass of men clutching each other, dealing blows with the
butt-ends of muskets, or fencing with bayonets--men in blue and gray,
wrestling, cursing, falling, and dying, in the midst of the crash of
small-arms, and the thunder of cannon, which clothed the crest in
flame.

When the smoke drifted, it was seen that the Confederates had been
repulsed, and driven from the hill. Hood was falling back slowly, like
a wounded tiger, who glares at the huntsman and defies him to the last.
The slope was strewed with some of his bravest. The Federal cannon
roaring on Round Top Hill, seemed to be laughing hoarsely.

McLaws, too, had fallen back after nearly seizing upon the crest in his
front. The enemy had quickly re-enforced their left, with brigades,
divisions, and corps, and the Confederates had been hotly assailed in
their turn. As night descended, the whole Southern line fell back. The
pallid moonlight shone on the upturned faces of the innumerable dead.

Longstreet sat on a fence, cutting a stick with his penknife, when an
English officer near him exclaimed:--

"I would not have missed this for any thing?"

Longstreet, laughed grimly.

"I would like to have missed it very much!"[1] he said.

[Footnote 1: His words.]


XXVI.


THE CHARGE OF THE VIRGINIANS.


Lee's great blow at the enemy's left had failed. He had thrown his
entire right wing, under Longstreet, against it. The enemy had been
driven; victory seemed achieved;--but suddenly the blue lines had
rallied, they had returned to the struggle, their huge masses had
rolled forward, thrown Longstreet back in turn, and now the pale moon
looked down on the battlefield where some of the bravest souls of the
South had poured out their blood in vain.

Lee had accomplished nothing, and one of his great corps was panting
and bleeding. It was not shattered or even shaken. The iron fibre would
stand any thing almost. But the sombre result remained--Longstreet had
attacked and had been repulsed.

What course would Lee now pursue? Would he retire?

Retire? The army of Northern Virginia lose heart at a mere rebuff?
Lee's veteran army give up the great invasion, after a mere repulse?
Troops and commander alike shrunk from the very thought. One more trial
of arms--something--an attack somewhere--not _a retreat_!

That was the spirit of the army on the night of the second of July.

A flanking movement to draw the enemy out of their works, or a second
attack remained.

Lee determined to attack.

Longstreet and Ewell had accomplished nothing by assailing the right
and left of the enemy. Lee resolved now to throw a column against its
centre--to split the stubborn obstacle, and pour into the gap with the
whole army, when all would be over.

That was hazardous, you will say perhaps to-day, reader. And you have
this immense argument to advance, that it failed. Ah! these arguments
_after the event_! they are so fatal, and so very easy.

Right or wrong, Lee resolved to make the attack; and on the third of
July he carried out his resolution.

If the writer of the South shrinks from describing the bloody repulse
of Longstreet, much more gloomy is the task of painting that last
charge at Gettysburg. It is one of those scenes which Lee's old
soldiers approach with repugnance. That thunder of the guns which comes
back to memory seems to issue, hollow and lugubrious, from a thousand
tombs.

Let us pass over that tragedy rapidly. It must be touched on in these
memoirs--but I leave it soon.

It is the third of July, 1863. Lee's line of battle, stretching along
the crest of Seminary Ridge, awaits the signal for a new conflict with
a carelessness as great as on the preceding day. The infantry are
laughing, jesting, cooking their rations, and smoking their pipes. The
ragged cannoneers, with flashing eyes, smiling lips, and faces
blackened with powder, are standing in groups, or lying down around the
pieces of artillery. Near the centre of the line a gray-headed officer,
in plain uniform, and entirely unattended, has dismounted, and is
reconnoitring the Federal position through a pair of field-glasses.

It is Lee, and he is looking toward Cemetery Heights, the Mount St.
Jean of the new Waterloo--on whose slopes the immense conflict is going
to be decided.

Lee gazes for some moments through his glasses at the long range
bristling with bayonets. Not a muscle moves; he resembles a statue.
Then he lowers the glasses, closes them thoughtfully, and his calm
glance passes along the lines of his army. You would say that this
glance penetrates the forest; that he sees his old soldiers, gay,
unshrinking, unmoved by the reverses of Longstreet, and believing in
themselves and in him! These accounts will undoubtedly vary according
to what each man thought fit to say in order to gild his own affairs:
some according to their bent and opinion, and others according to
their passion.

Although the matter has been witnessed and thoroughly known by many
persons, I am about to relate it as well as possible to your Grace,
as to a person who can weld all the facts together and give to each
circumstance the weight which it may possess and deserve. I shall
also give an account among other things of all that happened to Captain
Diego Belloso and myself on the journey to Lao, and the vicissitudes and
wars in this kingdom, from our arrival until the condition of affairs
now in force. Since Spaniards have taken part in all these events
it will please your Grace to know the manner and retirement with
which I have lived in this kingdom ever since my arrival here from
Manila, sustaining the soldiers and other men whom I brought in my
ship at my own expense, keeping them in a state of discipline and
honor, and never allowing them to abandon themselves to sensual
pleasures; although I had no credentials for this, for Gallinato
had those which the governor was to give me.

I shall not discuss the why and wherefore of most of the Chinese
matters, because Fray Alonso Ximenez and Fray Diego [97] witnessed
some of the events and heard of others and will have informed your
Grace of everything, including the war against the usurper, and Gallinato's
abandonment of this kingdom when affairs had practically been
settled.

Had he continued to follow up matters, half of the kingdom would today
justly belong to his Majesty, and the whole of it would be in the
power and under the rule of the Spaniards; and perhaps the king
himself with most of his people would have embraced Christianity.

As to Chinese matters which require most explanation I only ask your
Grace to consider the kingdom which we came to help, that the
Chinese had no more right there than we had, and that we had to try to
gain reputation, not to lose it. Since we came with a warlike attitude,
and it was the first time that an armed Spanish force set foot on the
mainland, was it right for us to endure insults, abuse, contempt, and
open affronts from a so vile race as they are, and before all these
pagans? [Was it right to endure] the further action of their arguments
before the usurping king, to induce him to kill us; their many
evil and infamous reports to him concerning us, in order to induce him
to grant their request; and above all their impudence in killing and
disarming Spaniards and going out in the streets to spear them?

All this I endured very patiently in order not to disturb the land by
breaking with them, until one day when they actually tried to kill some
of our men in their Parian, and the numbers being very unequal,
they had already wounded and maltreated them.

We came out at the noise and the Chinese drew up in battle array, armed
with many warlike instruments, challenging us to battle, with insults
and expressions of contempt.

At this juncture, what would have become of our reputation had we
retired when the advantage was on their side?

Then, too, after attacking and killing many of them what security had
we in this tyrannical kingdom, which showed itself not at all
friendly to us, with only one ship, [98] which was at the time aground,
and with the artillery and provisions ashore; while they had six
ships and many rowboats all provided with one or two culverins and
many men, both in the ships and those living in the port?

[99] Would it have been right, after war had broken out, to have them
with all their resources while we had none?

Had they taken our lives, what reputation would the Spaniards have
left in these kingdoms? For this reason I thought it better for
us to overpower them, rather than to be at their mercy, or at that
of the king.

Accordingly, in order to assure our lives we were obliged to seize their
ships and to strengthen ourselves by means of them, since the Chinese
began the war. After this, father Fray Alonso Ximenez and we thought
that, by making an embassy with presents to the king, and by exculpating
ourselves in this matter, before him, everything would turn out well;
and that if we had peace with him, and our persons in safety in a fort,
or under his word and safe-conduct, we would give the Chinese their
ship and property.

All this was written out and signed by us. In order to carry this out,
a letter was written in the name of the governor of that city [i.e.,
Manila], and we went to deliver it nine leguas away at the residence
of the king, leaving the vessels guarded. But when he found us there,
the king deprived us of the boats in which we had gone, and
refused to receive the letter, which went under form of embassy, or
to hear us unless we first restored the ships. Then he immediately
began to prepare arms and to assemble many men, with the intention,
unless we restored the ships, of killing us, or reducing us by
force to such straits as to compel us to restore them; and after
their restoration, of making an end of us all without trouble or
risk to his own men.

For he trusted us in nothing, since we were going in search of, and
bringing help to, him whom he had dispossessed. All this was told us
by some Christians among them, especially by a young mestizo from
Malaca who lived among them and knew their language.

Therefore considering that we were already separated from our companions,
and that, if we restored the ships, they could easily take ours by
means of them and kill the men left in them, and then us who were
in that place; also that if we waited for them to collect and attack us,
they could very easily kill us: we decided to seek the remedy by first
attacking them instead of waiting to be attacked; and try to rejoin our
men and assure our lives or end them by fighting. Accordingly we
attacked them, and such was our good fortune that we killed the
king in the fight.

Then we retired to our ships with great difficulty, without the loss of
a single Spaniard. We did not allow the king's house to be sacked,
so that it might not be said that we had done this to rob him. At this
juncture, the captain and sargento-mayor, our leader, arrived. He
belittled and censured what we had done, and ridiculed our statement
and that of some of the Cambodians, namely, that we had killed the
usurper.

All that he did was simply to collect whatever silver and gold certain
soldiers seized during these troubles, and everything valuable in the
ships, and then to burn the latter.

Then he drew up a report against us and dispossessed us of our ships
and command, thus formulating suspicion and distrust. After that he
gave orders for the departure from the kingdom, paying no heed to many
Cambodians who came to speak to us when we went ashore, and told
us that we might build a fortress there, for they had a legitimate
king before, but that he who was their king lately had driven him to
Lao, and thus they had no king; that they would gather wherever the most
protection could be found; and that we should continue the war.

Nor did the captain accept any of our suggestions, when we told him that
the usurper had imprisoned a kinsman of the lawful king; that we should
go to his rescue; that the latter would raise men in favor of
the legitimate king; and that with his support we would take possession
of the kingdom, and then go to get the king. But he was deaf to all
this and accordingly abandoned the kingdom, and this great opportunity
was lost. The only thing that we could obtain from him by great
entreaty after putting to sea, was to go to Cochinchina to inquire about
the galley, since they had intended to send from Manila for that purpose.
I also offered to go to Lao by land at my own expense, in search of
the king of Camboja, for I knew that that way led thither. Accordingly,
as soon as we arrived in Cochinchina, the captain sent Diego Belloso
and myself to Lao, and Captain Gregorio de Vargas to Tunquin.
Meanwhile he held an auction among the soldiers of everything
valuable from the Chinese ships, and of what else he had taken from
the soldiers; but the men were all without a real, and so he had
everything bought for himself, at whatever price he was pleased to
give.

The king of Sinoa, a province of Cochinchina, equipped us for the
voyage with a good outfit, by giving us an embassy for that country,
and men to accompany us on the road. Thus we made the entire journey
well provided and always highly honored and feared and much
looked at, as the like had never before been seen in those kingdoms.

We were all sick on the road; but in all our troubles we were
greatly comforted by the love which the people showed towards us,
and: by the kind reception that we met at the hands of all.

Finally we reached Lanchan, the capital and the royal seat of the
kingdom.

This kingdom has a vast territory, but it is thinly populated because
it has been often devastated by Pegu.

It has mines of gold, silver, copper, iron, brass, [sic] and tin. It
produces silk, benzoin, lac, brasil, wax, and ivory. There are also
rhinoceroses, many elephants, and horses larger than those of China.
Lao is bounded on the east by Cochinchina and on the northeast and north
by China and Tartaria, from which places came the sheep and the
asses that were there when I went.

Much of their merchandise is exported by means of these animals. On its
west and southwest lie Pegu and Sian, and on the south and southeast,
it is bounded by Camboja and Champan. [100] It is a rich country, and
everything imported there is very expensive.

Before our arrival at Lanchan, a cousin of the exiled king, on
account of the usurper's death, had fled thither from Camboja,
fearing lest the latter's son who was then ruling would kill him.

He related what we had done in Camboja, in consequence of which the
king of Lao received us very cordially, and showed great respect
for us, praising our deeds and showing amazement that they had been
accomplished by so few.

When we arrived the old king of Camboja, together with his elder son
and daughter, had already died, and there was left only the younger
son with his mother, aunt, and grandmother.

These women rejoiced greatly over our deeds and arrival, and more
attention was given them thenceforth.

Before our arrival at the city, we met an ambassador, whom the
usurping king, Anacaparan, had sent from Camboja, in order that he might
reach Lanchan before we did, and see what was going on there. He feigned
excuse and pretext of asking for the old queen, who was the step-mother
of the dead king Prauncar, and whom Anacaparan claimed to be his
father's sister. The king of Lao was sending her, but at our arrival,
and on our assuring him of Anacaparan's death, he ordered her to
return, and the ambassador, for fear of being killed, fled down the
river in a boat to Camboja.

Then we declared our embassy, and asked for the heir of the kingdom
in order to take him to our ships and thence to his own country.

We were answered that he [i.e., the younger son] was the only one,
and that they could not allow him to go, especially through a foreign
country, and over such rough roads and seas.

The youth wished to come, but his mothers [101] would not consent to it.
Finally it was decided that we should return to the fleet and proceed
with it to Camboja. We were to send them advices from there,
whereupon they would send him under a large escort.

His mothers gave me letters directed to that city [i.e., Manila],
making great promises to the Spaniards on behalf of the kingdom,
if they would return to Camboja to pacify the land and restore it
to them.

The king of Lao entrusted me with another embassy, in which he petitioned
for friendship and requested that the fleet return to Camboja, adding
that, should Gallinato be unwilling to return, he would send large
forces by land to our assistance, under command of the heir himself.

Thus we took leave and went to Cochinchina. While these things were
happening in Lao, the following occurred in Camboja. As soon as the
fleet had departed, the news of Anacaparan's death was published.
When it was heard by Chupinaqueo, kinsman of the lawful king, who
was in prison, he escaped from his prison, incited a province to rise,
collected its men, and having proclaimed Prauncar as the lawful
king, came to get us with about six thousand men, in order to join
us and make war upon the sons of the usurper, who were now ruling.

Not finding us in Chordemuco, where our ships had been lying, he
sent boats to look for us as far as the bar. Seeing that we were
nowhere to be found he seized all the Chinese and other people there,
and returned to his province where he had gathered his forces, and
there he fortified himself.

Meanwhile the men at Champan, who had gone thither to take it,
returned, whereupon the commander of the camp, called Ocuna de Chu,
took sides with the sons of the usurper and had one of them--the
second--Chupinanu by name, proclaimed king, because he was the most
warlike.

For this reason, the elder brother, called Chupinanon, and those of his
party were angered, and consequently there was continual strife
between them.

Then all having united, together with the army from Chanpan, pursued
Chupinaqueo, who came out to meet them with many of his men.

They fought for many days, but at last it was Chupinaqueo's fate to
be conquered and cruelly killed.

Thus for the time being Chupinanu ruled as king, and the camp was
disbanded, each man going to his own home.

At this time a ship arrived from Malaca on an embassy, bringing
some Spaniards who came in search of us, and a number of Japanese.

Chupinanu would have liked to have killed them all, but seeing that
they came on an embassy, and from Malaca, he let them go immediately.

A large province, called Tele, seeing the cruelty with which the king
treated them, revolted, and declaring themselves free, proclaimed
a new king; then they marched against Chupinanu, and defeated and
routed him, took from him a large number of elephants and artillery,
and sacked his city.

In the battle, most of the Spaniards and Japanese who had come from
Malaca were killed. Chupinanu retreated with all his brothers, six in
number, to another province, always accompanied by Ocuna de Chu.
There they began to make plans and to collect men. They also invited
two Malays, leaders of all the other Malays on whom Chupinanu relied
strongly, who on the break-up of the camp after Chupinaqueo's death, had
gone to the lands of which they were magistrates.

But in order that what follows may be understood, I will tell who
these Malays are. When this country was being ravaged by Sian, these
two went to Chanpan, taking with them many of their Malays, as well as
many Cambodians; and because the ruler of Champan did not show
them all the honors that they desired, they caused an insurrection
in the city when he was away.

They fortified themselves there, and then plundered the city, after which
they returned to this kingdom with all the artillery and many
captives.

When they arrived here the usurper Anacaparan was ruling. Congratulating
one another mutually for their deeds, the usurper gave them a friendly
welcome, and they gave him all the artillery and other things which
they had brought. Then the usurper gave them lands for their maintenance,
and made them great mandarins. These two Malays made it easy for him to
capture Champan, and offered to seize its king.

Since the latter had been so great and long-standing an enemy of the
Cambodians, Anacaparan immediately collected an army, which he
sent under command of Ocuna de Chu.

When we killed Anacaparan, these forces were in Chanpan, and,
as abovesaid, they returned after his death. These men presented
themselves before the new king, Chupinanu, with all their Malays and
it was at once decided to attack the insurgents of Tele.

At this juncture arrived the ambassador who had fled from Lao as we
reached Lanchan. He said that we had remained there and that our purpose
was to ask for the lawful heir of Camboja in order to take him to
our ships and transport him to his kingdom; that the king of
Cochinchina was going to help us in this undertaking; that we had
entered Lao with that report; and that the king of Lao was about
to send the heir with great forces by river and by land, while we
and the men of Cochinchina would go by sea and join them in Camboja,
where we would declare war and inflict severe punishment upon
whomsoever would not render homage.

When the new king and his followers heard this news they were
frightened, and consequently each thought only of himself.

A few days later it was reported from the bar that four Spanish ships had
entered, accompanied by many galleys from Cochinchina. This report
was either a vision that some had seen, or was a fiction; and we
have been unable to clarify the matter to this very day.

At any rate, on hearing this news, these people confirmed as true
the entire report of the ambassador who had fled. The mandarins of
Camboja, taking into consideration the war which was now waging with
the men of Tele, and the new one threatened by the Spaniards, Cochinchina,
and Lao, decided to depose the new king and render homage to the
one who was coming from Lao.

For this purpose they communicated with the two Malays and together
with them attacked the king with his brothers and turned them out
of the realm.

The two elder brothers fled separately, each to the province where
he thought to find more friends.

After this the mandarins ordered a fleet of row-boats to proceed toward
Lao to receive their king, who they said was already coming.

They sent Ocuna de Chu as leader of the fleet and also his two sons.
Other boats were sent to the bar to receive the Spaniards, and make
friendly terms with them, sending for that purpose certain Spaniards
there. Two Cambodian mandarins and the two Malays were to remain
to guard the kingdom, and to act as governors.

The Spaniards went to the bar, but, finding nothing, returned. Ocuna de
Chu took the road to Lao, but seeing that he did not meet his king,
or hear any news of him, resolved to go to Lanchan and ask for him.
He continued his march, but suffered some pangs of hunger, for he had
left the kingdom unprovided, and the way was long. On account of
this some of his men deserted, but at last he reached Lanchan with ten
armed praus.

All the kingdom of Lao was thrown into great confusion.

Imagining that he was coming to make war, they abandoned their villages
and property, and fled to the mountains. But on seeing that he was
coming on a peaceful mission, they lost their apprehension. At his
arrival we were already on the road to Cochinchina, whereupon the king
ordered us to return to Lanchan immediately. The king [of Lao], on
learning what was happening in Camboja, despatched there a large
fleet by sea, and forces by land, and sent for the king of that
country.

He despatched me to Cochinchina with news of what was happening,
and to take the ships to Camboja; but, while on the way, I heard
of the battle fought by our fleet, whereupon I returned to Camboja
with the king.

When we reached the first village of the kingdom, we learned from the
spies who had preceded us, that, as the news of the ships had been untrue,
and Cuna de Chu was delaying so long, the provinces where the two
brothers sought shelter had proclaimed them kings, and were at war
with one another; that the people of Tele had come to fight with
the governors, who were divided into factions; and that each man
obeyed whom he pleased.

But they said that Ocuna Lacasamana, one of the Malay headmen,
had the greatest force of artillery and praus; and that a Japanese
junk--the one that had been in Cochinchina when our fleet was there--had
arrived, and was supporting Chupinannu. The sea and land forces
were collected together at the point where this news had been received,
and it was found that they were not sufficient to make a warlike
entry. A fort was built there, and a request for more men sent to
Lao. In the meantime, secret letters were despatched to probe the
hearts of the leading men. The men from Lao delayed, and no answers
were received to the letters. Feeling insecure in that place, they
deliberated upon returning to Lao, but at this juncture news arrived
from Ocuna Lacasamana, one of the Malays who had fortified himself in
his own land, saying that he was on their side, although he had
rendered homage to Chupinanu--a feigned promise because he had seen
the king's delay--but that as soon as the king entered the land he would
join his party. Soon after news came from another Cambojan governor,
to the effect that, although he had rendered homage to Chupinanu,
yet, if the king would come to him, he would attack Chupinanu, and
depose or kill him.

For that he said that he had four thousand men fortified with himself
on a hill. He sent one of his relatives with this message. All
trusted in this man, and immediately we set out for that place. When
the above-mentioned man learned of the king's approach, he attacked
the other king and routed him; then he came out to receive us, and
thus we entered.

That province and many others were delivered to us immediately.

Chupinanu withdrew to some mountains. Immediately the two Malays, each
with his forces, joined us; the Japanese did the same. The king
then gave orders to pursue Chupinanu until he was taken and killed.
Then he seized another man who was acting as judge in another
province and put him to death.

Soon after war began against the eldest of the brothers and against the
people of Tele who also refused homage.

At this juncture, a ship arrived from Malaca with fourteen Spaniards of
our fleet, who had put into Malaca.

The king was delighted thereat, and honored and made much of them,
when he learned that they were some of the men who had killed the
usurper.

They were esteemed and respected in an extraordinary manner by the
whole kingdom.

Captain Diego Belloso tried to assume charge of them by virtue of an
old document from Malaca; this I forbade, alleging that the
right of this jurisdiction should proceed from Manila, since the
restoration of this kingdom proceeded from that place, and that
those men were Castilians and had nothing to do with his document
or with Malaca.

The king, before whom this matter was brought, replied that the matter
lay between us two, and refused to mingle in those affairs.

In front of the head-quarters tent the red battle-flag caught the
sunshine in its dazzling folds.

Suddenly, a new charm is added to the picturesque scene. Maiden figures
advance over the grassy lawn; bright eyes glimmer; glossy ringlets are
lifted by the fingers of the wind; tinkling laughter is heard;--and
over all rings the wild sonorous music of the bugle!

The days pass rapidly thus. The nights bring merriment, not sleep. The
general goes with his staff to the hospitable mansion, and soon the
great drawing-room is full of music and laughter. The song, the dance,
the rattling banjo follow. The long hours flit by like a flock of
summer birds, and Sweeney, our old friend Sweeney, is the king of the
revel.

For Sweeney rattles as before on his banjo; and the "Old Gray Horse"
flourishes still in imperishable youth! It is the same old Sweeney,
with his mild and deferential courtesy, his obliging smile, his
unapproachable skill in "picking on the string." Listen! his voice
rings again as in the days of '61 and '62. He is singing still "Oh
Johnny Booker, help this nigger!" "Stephen, come back, come back,
Stephen!" "Out of the window I did sail!" "Sweet Evelina," and the
grand, magnificent epic which advises you to "Jine the Cavalry!"

Hagan listens to him yonder with a twinkle of the eye--Hagan the
black-bearded giant, the brave whose voice resembles thunder, the
devotee and factotum of Stuart, whom he loves. And Sweeney rattles on.
You laugh loud as you listen. The banjo laughs louder than all, and the
great apartment is full of uproar, and mirth, and dance.

Then the couples sink back exhausted; a deep silence follows; Sweeney
has made you laugh, and is now going to make you sigh. Listen! You can
scarcely believe that the singer is the same person who has just been
rattling through the "Old Gray Horse." Sweeney is no longer mirthful;
his voice sighs instead of laughing. He is singing his tender and
exquisite "Faded Flowers." , had This new captive of governor where

sounded from another world!


II.


In home affairs the Irish question has, during many years, claimed
more attention than any other.

For some time there had been a great fall in the prices of agricultural
produce, and consequently the farmers in Ireland had a difficulty
in finding the money to pay their rents.

Then followed evictions, which the peasantry resisted by violence.
Parliament passed several measures, partly to give relief to the
peasantry under the hard times which had fallen upon them,
partly with a view to making the law stronger for the suppression of
outrages.

As these laws did not always meet the approval of the Irish
and their leaders in parliament, scenes of violence frequently occurred.
The worst act in the unhappy struggle--the murder of Lord Frederick
Cavendish and of Mr Burke, in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, in 1882--was
the work of a secret society, and received the condemnation of the
Irish leaders.

For many years there had been growing in Ireland a party which demanded
Home Rule--that is, that Ireland should manage her domestic affairs
by a parliament of her own at Dublin. At the general election in 1885,
86 members out of 103 returned for Ireland were in favour of Home
Rule.

In 1886 Mr Gladstone introduced a bill to grant Home Rule to Ireland;
but, as many of the Liberals refused to follow him in this change of
policy, he was defeated in the House of Commons.

In an appeal to the country, he was likewise defeated, and the
Marquis of Salisbury became prime-minister, with the support of a
combination of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists.

The government of Lord Salisbury lasted for six years. It carried several
useful measures, among which may be mentioned free education, and
the act for establishing county councils both in England and Scotland.

Each went into camp, ceased
active operations, and prepared for the new conflict which was to take
place before the end of the year.

I shall record some incidents of that rapid and shifting campaign,
beginning and ending in the month of October; then I pass on to the
more important and exciting pages of my memoirs: the mighty struggle
between Lee and Grant.

To return for a moment to the cavalry. It held the front along the
Rapidan and Robertson rivers, from Madison Court-House on the left, to
Chancellorsville on the right. Stuart kept his lynx-eye on all the
fords of the two rivers, having his head-quarters in the forks of the
streams not far from their junction.

I should like to speak of the charming hours spent at the hospitable
mansion near which head-quarters had been established. The sun shone
bright, at the house on the grassy hill, but not so bright as the eyes
which gave us friendly welcome. Years have passed since that time--all
things have changed--but neither time or the new scenes will banish
from some hearts the memory of that beautiful face, and the music of
that voice! We salute to-day as we saluted in the past--health and
happiness attend the fair face and the kindly heart!

I saw much of Mohun in those days, and became in course of time almost
his intimate friend. He exhibited still a marked reserve on the subject
of his past life: but I thought I could see that the ice was melting.
Day by day he grew gayer--gradually his cynicism seemed leaving him.
Who was this singular man, and what was his past history? I often asked
myself these questions--he persisted in giving me no clue to the
secret--but I felt a presentiment that some day I should "pluck out the
heart of his mystery."

So much, in passing, for my relations with Mohun. We had begun to be
friends, and the chance of war was going to throw us together often. I
had caught one or two glimpses of a past full of "strange matters"--in
the hours that were coming I was to have every mystery revealed.

Meanwhile Lee was resting, but preparing for another blow. His army was
in the highest spirits. The camps buzzed, and laughed, and were full of
mirth. Gettysburg was forgotten, or if remembered, it only served to
inflame the troops, and inspire them with a passionate desire to "try
again." In the blaze of a new victory, the old defeat would disappear.

.

[182] We are unaware of the exact location of this settlement of
Laguio.

It is probably the present village of Kiapo, which agrees with the
text and is mentioned by Argensola.

Nevertheless, from the description of this settlement given by Morga
(post, chapter viii) and Chirino, it can be inferred that Laguio
was located on the present site of the suburb of La Concepcion.

In fact, there is even a street called Laguio between Malate and
La Ermita.--Rizal.

[183] "Fine helmets were found broken in with clubs... About thirty
also escaped (among whom was Father Farfan), who were enabled to
do so because of being in the rear, and lightly armed" (Argensola).

--Rizal.

[184] Argensola says that the Chinese killed many peaceful merchants
in the parian, while others hanged themselves of their own accord. Among
these Argensola mentions General Hontay and the rich Chican--according
to the relation of Fray Juan Pobre, because the latter had refused
to place the famous Eng-Kang at the head of the movement.

--Rizal.

[185] "And they tried to persuade the natives to unite with them;
but the latter refused, and on the contrary killed as many of the
Sangleys as they caught" (Argensola).

--Rizal.

[186] Argensola says that "four thousand Pampangos, armed in the custom
of their country, with bows and arrows, half-pikes, shields, and long
broad daggers," were sent by the alcalde of Pampanga to the relief of
Manila, which now needed soldiers.

--Rizal.

[187] In this struggle many cruelties were committed and many
quiet and friendly Chinese killed.

Don Pedro de Acuna, who could not prevent or stifle this terrible
insurrection in its beginnings, also contributed to the horrible
butcheries that ensued.

"Accordingly many Spaniards and natives went to hunt the disbanded Sangleys,
at Don Pedro's order." Hernando de Avalos, alcalde of La Pampanga,
seized more than 400 pacific Sangleys, "and leading them to an
estuary, manacled two and two, delivered them to certain Japanese,
who killed them.

Father Fray Diego de Guevara of the order of St. Augustine, prior of
Manila, who made this relation, preached to the Sangleys first, but
only five abandoned their idolatry." ... Would he not have done
better to preach to Alcalde Avalos, and to remind him that he was a
man? The Spanish historians say that the Japanese and Filipinos
showed themselves cruel in the killing of the Chinese.

It is quite probable, considering the rancor and hate with which they
were regarded. But their commanders contributed to it also by
their example. It is said that more than 23,000 Chinese were killed.
"Some assert that the number of Sangleys killed was greater, but
in order that the illegality committed in allowing so many to enter
the country contrary to the royal prohibitions might not be known,
the officials covered up or diminished the number of those who
perished" (Argensola).

--Rizal

.

[188] The coming of the Spaniards to the Filipinas, and their government,
together with the immigration of the Chinese, killed the industry
and agriculture of the country.

The terrible competition of the Chinese with any individual of another
race is well known, for which reason the United States and Australia
refuse to admit them.

The indolence, then, of the inhabitants of the Filipinas, is derived from
the lack of foresight of the government. Argensola says the same thing,
and could not have copied Morga, since their works were published in
the same year, in countries very distant from one another, and the two
contain wide differences.--Rizal.

The Chinese question has always been of great importance in the
Philippines. The dislike of the Filipino for the Chinese seemed
instinctive and was deep-rooted. The subject of the Chinese immigration
to the islands has served for special legislation on many occasions
in Spain, but they have nevertheless persisted in their trading
and occupations therein.

See Stanley's edition of Morga, appendix II, pp. 363-368; and Los
Chinos en Filipinos (Manila, 1886)

.

[189] This should be six hundred and four.--Rizal.

[190] Nueva Espana.

--Rizal.

[191] This archbishop seems to have been a principal cause of the
disturbance and massacre of the Chinese, by taking a leading part
in exciting suspicion against them.

--Stanley.

[192] The Arab travelers of the ninth century mention that eunuchs
were employed in China, especially for the collection of the revenue,
and that they were called thoucam.

--Stanley

.
"We have flushed a regiment of infantry, Gordon. Can you break them?"

"I think I can, general."

The handsome face of the soldier glowed--his bright eyes flashed.

"All right. Get ready, then, to attack in front. I will take Young, and
strike them at the same moment on the right flank!"

With which words Stuart went at a gallop and joined Young.

That gay and gallant Georgian was at the head of his column; in his
sparkling eyes, and the smile which showed the white teeth under the
black mustache, I saw the same expression of reckless courage which I
had noticed on the day of Fleetwood, when the young Georgian broke the
column on the hill.

Stuart explained his design in three words:--

"Are you ready?"

"All ready, general!"

And Young's sabre flashed from the scabbard.

At the same instant the crash of carbines in front, indicated Gordon's
charge.

Young darted to the head of his column.

"Charge!" he shouted.

And leading the column, he descended like a thunderbolt on the enemy's
flank.

As he did so, Gordon's men rushed with wild cheers into the gorge.
Shouts, carbine-shots, musket-shots, yells resounded. In five minutes
the Federal infantry, some three hundred in number, were scattered in
headlong flight, leaving the ground strewed with new muskets, whose
barrels shone like burnished silver.

"Good!" Stuart exclaimed, as long lines of prisoners appeared, going to
the rear, "a fair beginning, at least!"

And he rode on rapidly.


V.


THE CHASE.


The cavalry pressed forward without halting and reached the hills above
James City--a magniloquent name, but the "city" was a small affair--a
mere village nestling down amid an amphitheatre of hills.

On the opposite range we saw the enemy's cavalry drawn up; and, as we
afterward learned, commanded by General Kilpatrick.

They presented a handsome spectacle in the gay autumn sunshine; but we
did not attack them. Stuart's orders were to protect the march of Ewell
from observation; and this he accomplished by simply holding the
Federal cavalry at arm's-length. So a demonstration only was made.
Skirmishers advanced, and engaged the enemy. The whole day thus passed
in apparent failure to drive the Federals.

A single incident marked the day. Stuart had taken his position, with
his staff and couriers, on a hill. Here, with his battle-flag floating,
he watched the skirmishers,--and then gradually, the whole party,
stretched on the grass, began to doze.

They were to have a rude waking. I was lying, holding my bridle, half
asleep, when an earthquake seemed to open beneath me. A crash like
thunder accompanied it. I rose quickly, covered with dust. A glance
explained the whole. The enemy had directed a gun upon the tempting
group over which the flag rose, and the percussion-shell had fallen and
burst in our midst.

Strangest of all, no one was hurt.

Stuart laughed, and mounted his horse.

"A good shot!" he said, "look at Surry's hat!" which, on examination, I
found covered half an inch deep with earth.

In fact, the shell had burst within three feet of my head--was a "line
shot," and with a little more elevation, would have just reached me.
Then, exit Surry! in a most unmilitary manner, by the bursting of a
percussion-shell.

At nightfall the enemy was still in position, and Stuart had not
advanced.

We spent the night at a farm-house, and were in the saddle again at
dawn.

The hills opposite were deserted. The enemy had retreated. Stuart
pushed on their track down the Sperryville road, passed the village of
Griffinsburg, and near Stonehouse Mountain came on, and pushed them
rapidly back on Culpeper Court-House.

All at once quick firing was heard on our right.

"What is that?" Stuart asked.

"An infantry regiment, general!" said Weller, one of our couriers,
galloping quickly up.

The words acted upon Stuart like the blow of a sword. A wild excitement
seemed to seize him.

"Bring up a squadron!" he shouted--for we were riding ahead without
support; "bring up the cavalry! I am going to charge! Bring me a
squadron!"

And drawing his sword, Stuart rushed at full gallop, alone and
unattended, toward the Federal infantry, whose gun-barrels were seen
glittering in the woods.

Never had I seen him more excited. He was plainly on fire with the idea
of capturing the whole party.

The staff scattered to summon the cavalry, and soon a company came on
at full gallop. It was the "Jefferson Company," under that brave
officer, Captain George Baylor.

"Charge, and cut them down!" shouted Stuart, his drawn sword flashing
as he forced his horse over fallen trees and the debris of the great
deserted camp.

A fine spectacle followed. As the Federal infantry double-quicked up a
slope, Baylor charged.

As his men darted upon them, they suddenly halted, came to a
front-face, and the long line of gun-barrels fell, as though they were
parts of some glittering war-machine.

The muzzles spouted flame, and the cavalry received the fire at thirty
yards.

It seemed to check them, but it did not. --HARVESTER.--Henry W. Pell,

--MODE OF OPERATING SWELL IN MELODEONS.

--C.E.
There was the gallant figure of General Fitz Lee, at the head of his
horsemen, advancing to charge what he supposed to be the enemy's
artillery near Bristoe, and singing as he went, in the gayest voice:--

  "Rest in peace! rest in peace!
  Slumb'ring lady love of mine;
  Rest in peace! rest in peace!
  Sleep on!"

There was the charge over the barricade near Yates's Ford, where a
strange figure mingled just at dusk with the staff, and when arrested
as he was edging away in the dark, coolly announced that he belonged to
the "First Maine Cavalry."

There was the march toward Chantilly, amid the drenching storm, when
Stuart rode along laughing and shouting his camp songs, with the rain
descending in torrents from his heavy brown beard.

There was the splendid advance on the day succeeding, through the rich
autumn forest, of all the colors of the rainbow.

Then the fight at Frying-Pan; arousing the hornets' nest there, and the
feat performed by Colonel Surry, in carrying off through the fire of
the sharp-shooters, on the pommel of his saddle, a beautiful girl who
declared that she was "not at all afraid!"

These and many other scenes come back to memory as I sit here at
Eagle's Nest. But were I to describe all I witnessed during the war, I
should never cease writing. All these must be passed over--my canvas is
limited, and I have so many figures to draw, so many pictures to paint,
that every square inch is valuable.

That is the vice of "memoirs," reader. The memory is an immense
receptacle--it holds every thing, and often trifles take the prominent
place, instead of great events. You are interested in those trifles,
when they are part of your own experience; but perhaps, they bore your
listener and make him yawn--a terrible catastrophe!

So I pass to some real and _bona fide_ "events." Sabres are going to
clash now, and some figures whom the reader I hope has not forgotten
are going to ride for the prize in the famous Buckland Races.


X.


I FALL A VICTIM TO TOM'S ILL-LUCK.


Stuart had fallen back, and had reached the vicinity of Buckland.

There was a bright light in his blue eyes, a meaning smile on his
mustached lip, which in due time I was going to understand.

Kilpatrick was following him. From the rear guard came the crack of
skirmishers. It seemed hard to understand, but the fact was perfectly
evident, that Stuart was retreating.

I had fallen out of the column, and was riding with Tom Herbert. Have
you forgotten that worthy, my dear reader? Has the roar of Gettysburg
driven him quite from your memory? I hope not. I have not mentioned him
for a long time, so many things have diverted me--but we had ridden
together, slept together, fought together, and starved together! Tom
had come to be one of my best friends, in fact, and his charming good
humor beguiled many a weary march. To hear him laugh was real
enjoyment; and when he would suddenly burst forth with,

  "Oh look at the riggings
  On Billy Barlo--o--o--ow!"

the sternest faces relaxed, the sourest personages could not but laugh.

Brave and honest fop! Where are you to-day, _mon garçon_! I wish I
could see you and hear you sing again!

But I am prosing. Riding beside Tom, I was looking down and thinking of
a certain young lady, when an exclamation from my companion made me
raise my head.

"By George! there's the house, old fellow!"

"The house?"

"Of the famous supper."

"So it is!"

"And my inamorata, Surry! I wonder if she is still there?"

"Inamorata? What is her other name?"

Tom laughed, and began to sing in his gayest voice,

  "Oh, Katy! Katy!
     Don't marry any other;
  You'll break my heart, and kill me dead,
     And then be hanged for murder!"

"That is answer enough," I said, laughing.

"Suppose we go and see if they are still alive," Tom said, blushing;
"ten minutes will take us to the house."

In fact, I saw across the fields, embowered in foliage, the hospitable
mansion in which we had eaten the famous supper, on the route to
Pennsylvania.

"It is risky," I said, hesitating.

"But pleasing," retorted Tom, with a laugh.

And I saw, from his flushed face, that he had set his heart on the
visit.

That conquered me. I never could refuse Tom Herbert any thing; and we
were soon cantering toward the house.

Leaving our horses in a little grove, near the mansion, in order that
they might not attract the attention of any of the enemy's vedettes, we
hastened up the steps.

As we reached the door, it opened, and Miss Katy Dare, the heroine of
Tom's dreams, very nearly precipitated herself into our arms.

"Oh, I am so glad to see you!" she exclaimed, with her auburn ringlets
dancing, her eyes sparkling,--and taking care to look at _me_ as she
uttered the words.

Then a whole bevy of young ladies hastened out to welcome us.

Where had we been? Why were we going back? Could General Stuart intend
to leave them in the Yankee lines again? Oh, no! he could not! He could
not have the heart to! "Calico printers when they wish to leave white
figures on a dark ground use what they term a 'resist paste' to
cover such places as are designed to be unaffected by the dye.

If the ingredients of this paste were known it might be what S.W.P.,
desires." This "resist paste" is 1 lb. of binacetate of copper
(distilled verdigris), 3 lbs.

sulphate of copper dissolved in 1 gal. water. This solution to be
thickened with 2 lbs. gum senegal, 1 lb. British gum and 4 lbs. pipe
clay; adding afterward, 2 oz. nitrate of copper as a deliquescent.

M.A.H, of Vt.--"I have a surplus of water power and desire to know the
probable cost of the apparatus for producing the electric light,
with a view of employing my surplus power in that direction." A
serviceable magneto-electrical machine for giving light is quite
expensive.

MANUFACTURING, MINING, AND RAILROAD ITEMS.

For the benefit of the Union Pacific railroad, the base of the Rocky
Mountains has been fixed at the base of the Black Hills, a distance
of 6.637 miles west of Cheyenne, and, according to the railway
surveys 525.078 miles from Omaha.

The Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago railway have just rebuilt in the
most permanent manner an iron bridge over the Alleghany river, to
replace the old wooden Howe truss bridge, which had become inadequate
to the increasing traffic.

The new bridge opens like a fan towards the freight yard at Pittsburg
being at the narrowest part, next to the main span 55 feet wide.

The river is crossed with spans averaging 153½ feet in the clear,
with a bearing of five feet on each pier.

The principle of the construction is known as the lattice girder
plan, with vertical stiffening.

The work was executed under the superintendence of its designer, the
engineer and architect of the company Felician Stataper.
The production of precious metals in the United States from 1849
to 1867 inclusive, has amounted in value to $1,174,000,000.
The president of one of the New Jersey railroads proposes a plan
to avoid the danger to life and limb from the series of trains that
run into and out of Jersey city. The new project is to elevate the
present tracks fifteen feet above the streets, and by safe machinery
to lower at once an entire train in the depot at the river."I can stand it easily," she said. "When we have a cherished object,
weariness does not count."

"A cherished object! What is yours?"

"Sit down, and I will tell you. I am tired. You can rejoin the column
in ten minutes."

"So be it," said Darke, gloomily.

And he sat down near her.

"You wish to be informed of my object in going with you everywhere,"
she said. And her voice which had at first been gay and careless,
assumed a mocking accent, making the nerves tingle. "I can explain in a
very few words my romantic desire. I wish to see _him_ fall."

"Humph!" ejaculated Darke, coldly; "you mean--"

"That man--yes. You promised to kill him, when you next met. Did you
not promise me that?"

Darke looked at the speaker with grim admiration.

"You are a singular woman," he said; "you never forget a wrong. And yet
the wrong, people might say, was committed by _you_--not _him_."

"Do _you_ say that?" exclaimed the woman with sudden venom in her
voice.

"I say nothing, madam," was the gloomy reply. "I only declare that you
hate much more strongly than I do. The Prince Regent had wished the
name of Georgiana; her own father wished to call her Elizabeth.
The little one was the first of the British royal house to receive the
benefits of Jenner's discovery of vaccination.

The Duke of Kent was so careful of his little girl that he took a
cottage at Sidmouth to escape the London winter.

To a friend he wrote: 'My little girl thrives under the influence of a
Devonshire climate, and is, I am delighted to say, strong and healthy;
too healthy, I fear, in the opinion of some members of my family,
by whom she is regarded as an intruder.'

Next winter the Duke came in one day, after tramping through rain
and snow, and played with his little child while in his damp clothes;
he thus contracted a chill from which he never rallied, and died
January 23, 1820.

This child was destined to be the Empress-Queen, on whose dominion
the sun never sets.

Yet so remote did such a destiny then seem, owing to the possibilities
of the Regent's life, and of children being born to the Duke of
Clarence, that in some courtly biographies of George III. there is
no mention made of the birth of the little princess.

Even in their accounts of the death of her father the Duke of
Kent, seven months afterwards, they do not deem it necessary to
state that he left a daughter behind him; though he, poor man, had
never had any doubts of her future importance, and had been in the
habit of saying to her attendants, 'Take care of her, for she may
be Queen of England.'

The Duke of Kent was a capable and energetic soldier, of pure tastes
and simple pleasures.

In presenting new colours to the Royal Scots in 1876, the Queen
said: 'I have been associated with your regiment from my earliest
infancy, as my dear father was your colonel.

He was proud of his profession, and I was always told to consider
myself a soldier's child.'

The position of the widowed Duchess of Kent, a stranger in a foreign
country, was rather sad and lonely.

It was further complicated by narrowness of means.

The old king, her father-in-law, died soon after her husband.

The duchess was a woman of sense and spirit.

Instead of yielding to any natural impulse to retire to Germany, she
resolved that her little English princess should have an English
rearing.

She found a firm friend and upholder in her brother Leopold, husband
of the late Princess Charlotte, and afterwards King of the Belgians.

On discovering her straitened means he gave her an allowance of
£3000 a year, which was continued until it was no longer necessary
in 1831.

As the duke came into a separate income only at a late period of his
life, he had died much in debt. Long afterwards the Queen said to Lord
Melbourne: 'I want to pay all that remains of my father's debts.

I must do it. I consider it a sacred duty.'

And she did not rest till she did it.

In reply to an address of congratulation on the coming of age of the
Queen, the Duchess of Kent said:

'My late regretted consort's circumstances, and my duties,
obliged us to reside in Germany; but the Duke of Kent at much
inconvenience, and I at great personal risk, returned to England,
that our child should be "born and bred a Briton."

In a few months afterwards my infant and myself were awfully deprived
of father and husband.

We stood alone--almost friendless and alone in this country; I could
not even speak the language of it.

I did not hesitate how to act, I gave up my home, my kindred, my duties
[the regency of Leiningen], to devote myself to that duty which
was to be the whole object of my future life.

I was supported in the execution of my duties by the country. It placed
its trust in me, and the Regency Bill gave me its last act of
confidence.

I have in times of great difficulty avoided all connection with any
party in the state; but if I have done so, I have never ceased to
press on my daughter her duties, so as to gain by her conduct the
respect and affection of the people.

This I have taught her should be her first earthly duty as a constitutional
sovereign.'
The little princess was brought up quietly and wisely at Kensington and
Claremont. In a letter from the Queen to her uncle Leopold, written
in 1843, we find the following: 'This place [Claremont] has a particular
charm for us both, and to me it brings back recollections of the
happiest days of my otherwise dull childhood, when I experienced
such kindness from you, dearest uncle, kindness which has ever since
continued....

Victoria [the Princess Royal] plays with my old bricks, &c., and I
see her running and jumping in the flower-garden, as old, though I
fear still _little_, Victoria of former days used to do.'

Bishop Fulford of Montreal remembered seeing her when four months old
in the arms of her nurse. In the following year she might be seen in a
hand-carriage with her half-sister, the Princess Feodora of
Leiningen.

Wilberforce in a letter to Hannah More, July 21, 1820, wrote: 'In
consequence of a very civil message from the Duchess of Kent, I waited
on her this morning.

She received me with her fine, animated child on the floor by her side,
with its playthings, of which I soon became one.'

She became familiar to many as a pretty infant, riding on her
sleek donkey (a gift from her uncle the Duke of York) in Kensington
Gardens.

She used to be seen in a large straw hat and a white cotton frock,
watering the plants under the palace windows, dividing the contents
of the watering-pot between the flowers and her feet, and often
took breakfast with her mother on the lawn there.

There are playful stories told of those happy early days. The little
princess was very fond of music, listening as one spell-bound when first
she heard some of Beethoven's glorious compositions. But like most
children, she rebelled against the drudgery of scales and finger
exercises, and on being told that there is 'no royal road to music,'
she sportively locked the piano and announced that 'the royal road
is never to take a lesson till you feel disposed.'

Sir Walter Scott records in his diary that he dined with the Duchess
of Kent on 19th May 1828.

'I was very kindly received by Prince Leopold, and presented to the
little Victoria--the heir-apparent to the crown as things now
stand.

The little lady is educated with much care, and watched so closely that
no busy maid has a moment to whisper "You are heir of England." I
suspect if we could dissect the little heart, we should find that
some pigeon or other bird of the air had carried the matter, however.'

This, it seems, was not the case. Charles Knight has told us how he
one morning saw the household breakfasting in the open air, at a
table on the lawn.

It is also related that Victoria took her airings in Kensington
Gardens in a little phaeton drawn by a tiny pony, led by a page.

A dog ran between the legs of the pony one day, frightening it, so
that the little carriage was upset, and the princess would have
fallen on her head, but for the presence of mind of an Irishman who
rescued her.

Leigh Hunt saw her once 'coming up a cross-path from the
Bayswater gate, with a girl of her own age by her side, whose hand
she was holding as if she loved her;' and he adds that the footman
who followed seemed to him like a gigantic fairy.

When the princess was in her fifth year, George IV., who acted as
one of her godfathers, sent a message to parliament which resulted
in a grant for the cost of the education of his niece.

In 1824, when the princess was five years old, Fräulein Lehzen, a
German lady, became her governess; afterwards she held the post of
the Queen's private secretary, until relieved by the Prince-Consort.

She was the daughter of a Hanoverian pastor, and came to England
in 1818 as governess to the Princess Feodora of Leiningen.

In her home letters she records that 'the princess received her in
a pretty, childlike way,' and describes her as 'not tall, but very
pretty;' adding that she 'has dark brown hair, beautiful blue eyes,
and a mouth which, though not tiny, is very good-tempered and
pleasant; very fine teeth, a small but graceful figure, and a very
small foot.

She was dressed in white muslin with a coral necklet.'

The domestic life was that of any other well-regulated and happy
family.

The princess shared her governess's bedroom.

They all took their meals together at a round table.

When they did not go to church, the duchess read a sermon aloud and
commented pleasantly on it.

As early as 1830 Thomas Moore heard the Princess Victoria sing duets
with her mother, who also sang some pretty German songs herself.

Nor are there lacking traces of strict and chastening discipline. The
princess had been early taught that there are good habits and duties
in the management of money. When she was buying toys at Tunbridge
Wells, her wishes outran her little purse, and the box for which she
could not pay was not carried away on credit, but set aside
for her to fetch away when the next quarter-day would renew her
allowance. Fräulein Lehzen says, 'The duchess wished that when she and
the princess drove out, I should sit by her side, and the princess at
the back. Several times I could not prevent it, but at last she has
given in, and says on such occasions with a laugh to her daughter:
"Sit by me, since Fräulein Lehzen wishes it to be so." But,' says the
governess, 'I do not hesitate to remark to the little one, whom I am
most anxious not to spoil, that this consideration is not on her
account, because she is still a child, but that my respect for her
mother disposes me to decline the seat.'

Once when the princess was reading how Cornelia, the mother of the
Gracchi, introduced her sons to the first of Roman ladies with the
words, 'These are my jewels,' she looked up from her book, and
remarked: 'She should have said my _Cornelians_.'

[Illustration: Princess Victoria--Early Portrait.]
Mrs Oliphant remembers of having in her own youth seen the Princess
Victoria, and says: 'The calm full look of her eyes affected me.

Those eyes were very blue, serene, still, looking at you with a
tranquil breadth of expression which, somehow, conveyed to your
mind a feeling of unquestioned power and greatness, quite poetical
in its serious simplicity.'

While on a visit to Malvern she climbed walls and trees, and rode on a
donkey. One day she had climbed an apple tree, and could not get down
till relieved by the gardener, who got a guinea for his pains,
which was preserved and neatly framed.

On another occasion, at Wentworth House, the gardener cautioned her: 'Be
careful, miss, it's slape' (using a provincial form for 'slippery'),
while she was descending a sloping piece of turf, where the ground
was wet.

While she was asking, 'What is _slape?_'her feet slid from beneath her,
and the old gardener was able to explain as he lifted her up, 'That's
slape, miss.'
Miss Jane Porter, then resident at Claremont, describes the princess as
a beautiful child, with a cherubic form of features, clustered round
by glossy, fair ringlets.

Her complexion was remarkably transparent, with a soft, but often
heightening tinge of the sweet blush-rose upon her cheeks, that
imparted a peculiar brilliancy to her clear blue eyes.

Whenever she met any strangers in her usual paths, she always seemed,
by the quickness of her glance, to inquire who and what they were?

The intelligence of her countenance was extraordinary at her very
early age, but might easily be accounted for on perceiving the
extraordinary intelligence of her mind.

At Esher Church, even in her sixth year, the youthful princess was
accustomed to devote earnest attention to the sermons preached
there, as the Duchess of Kent was in the habit of inquiring not
only for the text, but the heads of the discourse.

'The sweet spring of the princess's life,' continues Miss Porter,
'was thus dedicated to the sowing of all precious seeds of knowledge,
and the cultivation of all elegant acquirements....

Young as she was, she sang with sweetness and taste; and my brother,
Sir Robert (who, when in England, frequently had the honour of dining
at Claremont), often had the pleasure of listening to the infant
chorister, mingling her cherub-like melody with the mature and delightful
harmonies of the Duchess of Kent and Prince Leopold.'
When Fräulein Lehzen died in 1870, her old pupil wrote of her as 'my
dearest, kindest friend, old Lehzen; she knew me from six months
old, and from my fifth to my eighteenth year devoted all her care
and energies to me, with the most wonderful abnegation of self,
never even taking one day's holiday.

I adored, although I was greatly in awe of her.

She really seemed to have no thought but for me.'

And the future queen profited by it all, for it has been truly said
that, 'had she not been the Queen of England, her acquirements and
accomplishments would have given her a high standing in society.'

Dr Davys, the future Bishop of Peterborough, was her instructor in Latin,
history, mathematics, and theology, and the Dowager Duchess of
Northumberland had also, after her own mother, a considerable share
in her training.

The Duchess of Kent took her daughter to visit many of the chief
cities, cathedrals, and other places of interest in the British
Isles.

Her first public act was to present the colours to a regiment of foot
at Plymouth.

An American writer has recorded that he saw the widowed lady and her
little girl in the churchyard of Brading, in the Isle of Wight.

They were seated near the grave of the heroine of a 'short and
simple annal of the poor'--the _Dairyman's Daughter_, whose story,
as told by the Rev.

Legh Richmond, had a great popularity at the time.

The duchess was reading from a volume she carried (probably that one),
and the little princess's soft eyes were tearful.

The princess, it appears, was much devoted to dolls, and played
with them until she was nearly fourteen years old.

Her favourites were small wooden dolls which she would occupy herself
in dressing; and she had a house in which they could be placed.

As she had no girl companions, many an hour was solaced in this
manner. She dressed these dolls from some costumes she saw in the theatre
or in private life.

A list of her dolls was kept in a copy-book, the name of each, and
by whom it was dressed, and the character it represented, being
given.

The dolls seem to have been packed away about 1833. Of the 132 dolls
preserved, thirty-two were dressed by the princess.

They range from three to nine inches in height. The sewing and
adornment of the rich coloured silks and satins show great deftness
of finger.

Her wise mother withheld her from the pomp and circumstance of the
court.
She was not even allowed to be present at the coronation of her
uncle, the Duke of Clarence, when he ascended the throne as William
IV.

He could not understand such reticence, was annoyed by it, and expressed
his annoyance angrily.

But his consort, good Queen Adelaide, was always kind and considerate:
even when she lost all her own little ones, she could be generous
enough to say to the Duchess of Kent, 'My children are dead, but
yours lives, and she is mine too.'

All doubts as to the princess's relation to the succession were
gradually removed. George IV. had died childless. Both the children of
William IV.

were dead. The Princess Victoria therefore was the heiress of England. A
paper had been placed in the volume of history she had been reading,
after perusing which she remarked, 'I never saw this before.'

'It was not thought necessary you should, princess,' the governess
replied.

'I see,' she said timidly, 'that I am nearer the throne than I thought.'

'So it is, madam,' said the governess.

'Now many a child,' observed the princess thoughtfully, 'would boast, but
they don't know the difficulty. There is much splendour, but there is
more responsibility.' And putting her hand on her governess's, she said
solemnly, '_I will be good_.' Let that be recorded as among royal vows
that have been faithfully fulfilled.

In August 1835, the Princess Victoria was confirmed in the Chapel Royal,
St James's, by the Archbishop of Canterbury; and she was so much moved
by the solemn service, that at the close of it she laid her head on
her mother's breast, and sobbed with emotion.

CHAPTER II.

First Meeting with Prince Albert--Death of William IV.--Accession of
Queen Victoria--First Speech from the Throne--Coronation--Life at
Windsor--Personal Appearance--Betrothal to Prince Albert--Income from
the Country--Her Majesty a genuine Ruler.

The first great event in the young princess's life, and that which
was destined to colour it all for her good and happiness, was her
first meeting in 1836 with her cousins, her mother's nephews, the
young princes Ernest and Albert of Saxe-Coburg.

That visit was of about a month's duration, and from the beginning
the attraction was mutual. We can see how matters went in a letter
from Princess Victoria to King Leopold, 7th June 1836. 'I have only
now to beg you, my dearest uncle, to take care of the health of
one now so dear to me, and to take him under your special protection.

I hope and trust that all will go on prosperously and well on this
subject, now of so much importance to me.' Although in her heart
preferring Albert, she had been equally kind to both, and her preference
was as yet unknown.
Passing a small house, a poor woman came out, and with eyes full of
tears, exclaimed, addressing Stuart:--

"Oh, child! stop a minute! Are they coming back? They have took every
thing I had--they are _not_ coming back!"[1]

[Footnote 1: Her words.]

Stuart stopped. He was riding at the head of his staff, preceded by his
battle-flag. Not a trace of amusement was seen on his features, as he
heard himself addressed in that phrase, "Oh, child!"

"Have they treated you so badly?" he said, in his grave, kind voice.

"Oh, yes!" exclaimed the poor woman, weeping bitterly, "they have took
every hog, cow, and ear of corn I have, and every thing from my
daughter; she is a widow, and lives near us. These are her children, my
grandchildren, come to get out of the way."[1]

[Footnote 1: Her words.]

And she pointed to two or three little girls, with frightened faces,
and eyes wet with tears.

Stuart seemed deeply affected. Under that stout heart, which never
shrunk, was a wealth of sweetness and kindness.

"Well, they are not coming back, my good woman," he said, in a voice of
deep feeling. "You need not be afraid--they are gone now."

The poor woman clasped her hands.

"Oh! do you believe that, child!"[1] she said; "do you believe they'll
never come back?"

[Footnote 1: Her words.]

"I hope not, at least," Stuart replied, in a low tone.

"She clasped her hands, and for the third time addressing him as
'child,' sobbed:--

"Oh! if they will only never come back!"

That scene affected me deeply. The poor woman's tears brought something
into my throat which seemed to choke me. This time the Northern
soldiers had been impartial in their marauding. They had not only
destroyed the property, and carried off the slaves of the wealthy
proprietors, the "bloated aristocrats;" they had taken the bread out of
the mouths of the widow and the fatherless--leaving them bare and
starving in that bleak December of '63.

War conducted in that manner is barbarous--is it not, reader? The cry
of that widow and her children must have gone up to Heaven.

Stuart returned to his bivouac in the pine wood near Verdiersville,
where he had slept without tents, by his camp-fire, all these freezing
nights. Then the army began to move; soon it resumed its former
position; the cavalry was sent to watch the fords of the Rapidan; and
Stuart returned to his own head-quarters near Orange Court-House, gayly
singing, as he had left them to advance and meet the enemy.


XIV.


STUART'S WINTER QUARTERS.


COON HOLLOW!--


What gay memories are evoked by that familiar name! How we laughed and
sang in that hollow in the hills near Orange, in the cold winter of
1863!

Stuart called his head-quarters "Wigwam Independence," but the officers
of his staff gave them the sobriquet of "Coon Hollow;" and I adopt in
my memoirs the old familiar designation.

Never were soldiers more comfortable than the inhabitants of Coon
Hollow!--and Stuart's tent was the most comfortable of all. He had
stretched a large canvas beneath some sheltering trees; and filling up
the opening at each end with a picturesque wicker-work of evergreens,
ensconced himself there in his sylvan lodge, like some Robin Hood, or
ranger of the greenwood in old times. The woodland haunt and open air
life seemed, at first, to charm the bold cavalier; nothing seemed
wanting to his happiness, lost here in the forest: but soon the
freezing airs "demoralized" even the stout cavalryman, and he exchanged
his canvas for a regular tent of the largest description, with a plank
floor, a camp-couch, and a mighty chimney, wherein sparkled, ere long,
a cheerful fire of hickory, driving away the blasts of the cold winter
nights, which were sent on their way with song.

Such was Stuart's own domicile. The staff tents were grouped around,
with their solid chimneys of rock. The "cavalry head-quarters" was
complete--a warm nest in the woods. Couriers came and went; sabres
rattled; spurs jingled; the horses whinnied from their stables, woven
of pine boughs, near by; and in and out of the general's tent played
his two boisterous setters, Nip and Tuck, the companions of his idle
hours. We all messed together, under a broad canvas, at one table:
music resounded; songs were sung; Sweeney, soon, alas! to be dead, was
yet king of the woodland revels; Stuart joined in his songs, to the
music of the banjo; and not seldom did the bright faces of fair ladies
shine on us, bringing back all the warmth of the summer days--the blue
sky, the sunshine, and the smiles!

Such was good old "Coon Hollow." I recall it with delight. The chill
airs cut you to the bone when you ventured out on horseback from the
sheltered nook; but in Coon Hollow all was warm and bright. In the
woods on the crest above, the winds sighed: but in the hollow below,
the banjo rattled; laughter resounded; great fires roared; and, as
though in open defiance of winter and its tempests, Stuart, carolled in
his clear and sonorous voice, his favorite ditty,

  "The dew is on the blossom."

So we sang and laughed all those long winter evenings. The winds
carried away the sound of jests, and banjo notes. The long hours of
winter thus flew by like birds lost, one by one, in the night of the
past. Happy days! happy nights! I remember them still. Stuart is
dead--more than one of my dear companions have followed him--but their
voices sound again, their eyes again flash, their friendly smiles
linger in memory.

So the days fled by--and I wonder if our friends across the Rapidan,
who were going to crush us, were as gay as the folk about to be
crushed? The future looked stormy, but we laughed--and we did right,
did we not, friend? That mirth was not unseemly--not unworthy of
approval. It is evidence at least of "game," _non fractum esse fortunâ
et retinere in rebus asperis, dignitatem_--is it not? Good fortune,
wealth, and success, are nothing compared to that. For my part, I would
rather have the equal mind in arduous things, than money in my purse,
or victory. The army of Northern Virginia had that in the winter of
1863, as they had had it in 1861 and '62, and were going to have it in
the dark year and black winter preceding April, 1865.

But I linger too long on those days at "Coon Hollow." The wave of war
had wafted us to that quiet nook; for a time, we laughed and sang; but
the storm was coming. Soon it struck us; and we left the harbor, driven
by the tempest.

So I dismiss Coon Hollow, lost amid the hills of Orange. The spot is
desolate to-day, and the bleak wood is silent. But for me, Stuart is
singing there now as then--and will sing in my memory forever!


XV.


LEE'S "RAGGED REGIMENTS."


It required a stout heart to laugh and sing, _con amore_, in the last
days of that winter, and the first days of spring, 1864.

Those very figures, "1864," tell the story, and explain this. Do they
not, reader?

Each year of the war has its peculiar physiognomy.

1861--that is mirth, adventure, inexperience, bright faces, wreaths of
flowers, "boxes" from home, and "honorable mention" in reports, if you
only waved your sword and shouted "Hurrah!" They differ from them in
their hair, which the men wear cut in a cue, like the ancient style in
Espana. Their bodies are tattooed with many designs, but the face
is not touched. [301] They wear large earrings of gold and ivory in
their ears, and bracelets of the same; certain scarfs wrapped round
the head, very showy, which resemble turbans, and knotted very gracefully
and edged with gold. They wear also a loose collarless jacket with
tight sleeves, whose skirts reach half way down the leg. These
garments are fastened in front and are made of medrinaque and colored
silks. They wear no shirts or drawers, but bahaques [i.e., breech-clouts]
of many wrappings, which cover their privy parts, when they remove
their skirts and jackets. The women are good-looking and graceful. They
are very neat, and walk slowly. Their hair is black, long, and drawn
into a knot on the head.

Their robes are wrapped about the waist and fall downward. These
are made of all colors, and they wear collarless jackets of the same
material. Both men and women go naked and without any
coverings, [302] and barefoot, and with many gold chains, earrings, and
wrought bracelets.

Their weapons consist of large knives curved like cutlasses, spears,
and caracas [i.e., shields]. They employ the same kinds of boats as
the inhabitants of Luzon.

They have the same occupations, products, and means of gain as the
inhabitants of all the other islands. These Visayans are a race less
inclined to agriculture, and are skilful in navigation, and eager for
war and raids for pillage and booty, which they call mangubas.
[303] This means "to go out for plunder."

Near the principal settlement of the island of Sebu, there is a fine
port for all manner of vessels. It has a good entrance and
furnishes shelter at all times. It has a good bottom and is an
excellent anchorage. There are also other ports and bars of less
importance and consideration, as in all these islands, for smaller
vessels.

This island of Sebu is an island of more than one hundred leguas
in circumference.

It has abundance of provisions, and gold mines and placers, and is inhabited
by natives.

Beyond it lie other islands, very pleasant and well populated, especially
the island of Panay. Panay is a large island, more than one
hundred leguas in circumference, containing many native settlements.
[304] It produces considerable quantities of rice, palm-wine, and all
manner of provisions. It has flourishing and wealthy settlements, on
what is called the river of Panay. The chief one is Oton, which has a
bar and port for galleys and ships, shipyards for building large
ships, and a great amount of timber for their construction.

There are many natives, who are masters of all kinds of shipbuilding.
Near this island lies an islet eight leguas in circumference, which
is densely populated by natives who are all carpenters. They are
excellent workmen, and practice no other trade or occupation; and, without
a single tree of any size on this whole islet, they practice this art
with great ability. From there all the islands are furnished with
workmen for carpentry. The island is called that of the Cagayanes.

After the island of Sebu follow immediately the island of Mindanao, an
island of more than three hundred leguas in circumference, and Jolo,
which is small. Lower down is the island of Borneo, a very large
island, more than five hundred leguas in circumference. All of
these islands are densely populated, although that of Borneo is not
subdued. Neither is that of Mindanao in entirety, but only the river
of Botuan, Dapitan, and the province and coast of Caragan.

Below this island [Mindanao], before reaching that of Borneo, lie the
islands of the Calamianes.

They are very numerous, and consist of islands of various sizes, which
are densely inhabited with natives; they have some supply of
provisions and engage in certain kinds of husbandry.

However the most usual occupation is that of their navigations from
island to island in pursuit of their trading and exchange, and their
fisheries; while those who live nearest the island of Borneo are wont
to go on piratical raids and pillage the natives in other islands.

The flow- and ebb-tides, and the high and low tides among these islands
are so diverse in them that they have no fixed rule, either because
of the powerful currents among these islands, or by some other natural
secret of the flux and reflux which the moon causes. No definite knowledge
has been arrived at in this regard, for although the tides are
highest during the opposition of the moon, and are higher in the
month of March than throughout the rest of the year, there is so
great variation in the daily tides that it causes surprise.

Some days there are two equal tides between day and night, while
other days there is but one. At other times the flow during the
day is low, and that of the night greater. They usually have no
fixed hour, for it may happen to be high-tide one day at noon, while
next day high-tide may be anticipated or postponed many hours.It was no longer a company of gay gallants marching
by, amid music, waving scarfs, and showers of nosegays from fairy
hands. It was a stormy wave of gaunt warriors, in ragged clothes and
begrimed faces, who clutched their shining muskets, rushed headlong
over the breastworks, and, rolling through the blazing and crackling
woods, swept the enemy at the point of the bayonet, with the hoarse and
menacing cry, "Remember Jackson!" Gettysburg followed--never was
grapple more fierce than that, as we have seen; and when the veterans
of Lee were hurled back, the soil of the continent seemed to shake.
They were repulsed and retreated, but as the lion retreats before the
huntsman, glaring back, and admonishing him not to follow too closely,
if he would consult his own safety. At Williamsport the wounded lion
halted and turned--his pursuer did not assail him--and he crossed the
Potomac, and descended to the Rapidan, to strike in turn that dangerous
blow in October, when Meade was nearly cut off from Washington.

With that campaign of Bristoe, and the fiasco of Mine Run, the year of
1863 ended.

It left the South bleeding, and what was worse,--discouraged. Affairs
were mismanaged. The army had scarcely sufficient meat and bread to
live on. The croakers, clad in black coats, and with snowy shirt
bosoms, began to mutter under their breath, "It is useless to struggle
longer!"--and, recoiling in disgust from the hard fare of "war times,"
began to hunger for the flesh-pots of Egypt. Manna was tasteless now;
the task-master was better than the wilderness and the scant fare. Oh!
to sit by the flesh-pots and grow fat, as in the days when they did eat
thereof! Why continue the conflict? Why waste valuable lives? Why think
of still fighting when flour was a hundred dollars a barrel, coffee
twenty dollars a pound, cloth fifty dollars a yard, and good whiskey
and brandy not to be purchased at any price? Could patriotism live amid
trials like that? Could men cling to a cause which made them the
victims of Yankee cavalry? Why have faith any longer in a government
that was bankrupt--whose promises to pay originated the scoffing
proverb, "as worthless as a Confederate note!" Meat and drink was the
religion of the croakers in those days. Money was their real divinity.
Without meat and drink, and with worthless money, the Confederacy, in
their eyes, was not the side to adhere to. It was unfortunate--down
with it! Let it be anathema-maranatha!

The croakers said that--and the brave hearts whom they insulted could
not silence them. There were stout souls in black coats--but the
croakers distilled their poison, working busily in the darkness. It was
the croakers who bought up the supplies, and hoarded them in garrets,
and retailed them in driblets, thereby causing the enormous prices
which, according to them, foretold the coming downfall. They evaded the
conscript officers; grew fat on their extortions; and one day you would
miss them from their accustomed haunts--they had flitted across the
Potomac, and were drinking their wine in New York, London, or Paris.

Meanwhile, three classes of persons remained faithful to the
death:--the old men, the army, and the women.

The gray-beards were taking down their old guns and swords, and forming
home-battalions, to fight the enemy to the death when his cavalry came
to lay waste the country.

The women were weaving homespun, knitting socks, nursing the wounded,
and praying. They had never ceased to pray, nor had they lost the heart
of hope. The croakers believed in success, and their patron saint was
Mammon. The women believed in the justice of the cause, and in God. In
1861, they had cheered the soldiers, and waved their handkerchiefs, and
rained bouquets. In 1862, they had sent brave words of encouragement,
and bade their sons, and brothers, and husbands fight to the end. In
1863, they repeated that--sent the laggards back to the ranks--and when
they were not sewing, or nursing the sick, were praying. O women of
Virginia, and the great South to her farthest limits, there is nothing
in all history that surpasses your grand record! You hoped, in the dark
days as in the bright;--when bearded men shrunk, you fronted the storm
unmoved! Always you hoped, and endured, and prayed for the land. Had
the rest done their duty like the women and the army, the red-cross
flag would be floating to-day in triumph!

The army--that was unshaken. Gettysburg had not broken its strength,
nor affected its stout manhood. Lee's old soldiers believed in him
after Gettysburg, in the winter of '63, as they had believed in him
after Fredericksburg, in the winter of '62. They had confidence still
in their great leader, and in their cause. The wide gaps in their ranks
did not dismay them; want of food did not discourage them; hunger,
hardships, nakedness, defeat,--they had borne these in the past, they
were bearing them still, they were ready to bear them in the future.
War did not fright them--though the coming conflict was plainly going
to be more bitter than any before. The great array of Grant on the
north bank of the Rapidan did not depress them--had they not met and
defeated at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville a force as great, and
could not they do it again?

So they lay in their camps on the Rapidan, in that cold winter of
1863--a little army of ragged and hungry men, with gaunt faces, wasted
forms, shoeless feet; with nothing to encourage them but the cause,
past victories, and Lee's presence. That was much; what was enough,
however, was the blood in their veins; the inspiration of the great
race of fighting men from whom they derived their origin. Does any one
laugh at that? The winner will--but the truth remains.

That ragged and famished army came of a fighting race. It was starving
and dying, but it was going to fight to the last.

When the cannon began to roar in May, 1864, these gaunt veterans were
in line, with ragged coats, but burnished bayonets. When Lee, the gray
cavalier, rode along their lines, the woods thundered with a cheer
which said, "Ready!"


XVI.


HAMMER AND RAPIER.


I pass to the great collision of armies in the first days of May.

Why say any thing of that dark episode called "Dahlgren's raid?" A full
account would be too long--a brief sketch too short. And whatever our
Northern friends may think, it is not agreeable to us to dwell on that
outrage. Was that _war_? Was it civilized warfare to march in the
darkness upon a city full of women and children--to plan the
assassination of the Southern President and his cabinet; the
destruction of the city by the torch; the release of the Federal
prisoners at Belle Isle, to be let loose afterward with fire and sword
on Richmond?

Alas! all that was planned. The orders were captured, and exist still.
Was that war? I repeat. Answer, friends of the North. Or, did you think
us mere wild beasts?

I omit all that, passing on to the real fighting.

General Ulysses S. Grant had been appointed commander-in-chief of the
armies of the United States, and had taken command in person of the
army of the Potomac, confronting Lee on the Rapidan.

Before the curtain rises, and the cannon begin to roar, let us glance
at the relative numbers, and the programme of the Federal leader.

Grant's "available force present for duty, May 1, 1864," was, according
to the report of the Federal Secretary of War, 141,166 men.

Lee's force, "present for duty," as his army rolls will show, was
52,626 men. That is to say, rather more than one-third of his
adversary's.

Lee afterward received about 10,000 re-enforcements from Beauregard's
columns. Grant received about 50,000.

The royal pair spent three days of honeymoon at Windsor news, and
then Her Majesty had to return to London, to hold court, and to receive
addresses of congratulation her marriage; indeed, she was
nearly'addressed to death.'

The Queen and Prince Albert went everywhere together; to church,
to reviews, to races, theatres, drawing-rooms; and everywhere the
people were charmed with their beauty and happiness.

tried friend, the wise Baron Stockmar, and to Albert, gate reply.

Etiquette of course forbade the gentleman in this case to speak first;
and we can well believe that the Queen was more nervous over this
matter than over many a state occasion.

How the thing took place we may gather in part from a letter of
Prince Albert to his grandmother:' The Queen sent for me to her room,
and disclosed to me, in a genuine outburst of love and affection, that
I had gained her sound, his apprehension is; but the I will show them
that I am Queen of England.' This little episode has since gone by

view; and that they should be made know,_as yet_, no difference

Court gossips considered the Queen'to be very fond of her children,
but severe. in her manner, and a strict disciplinarian in her
family.'

A nurse in the royal household them for the high position they would
like such a eventually have to fill, they should in no wise come

The children were scarcely known to the Queen's ladies-in-waiting,

Hereupon arose a discussion both in and out of parliament as to the
amount object of so much affection.'

Prince Albert knew he was choosing a position of no ordinary difficulty
and responsibility.' the exception of my relation to the Queen,
my future position will have its dark sides, and the sky will not

But life has its thorns in every was position, and great as that

True love is always humble.

Among the entries in the Queen's Journals are many like this:' How
I will strive to make Albert feel as little as possible the great
sacrifice he has made!

I told him it_was_ a great sacrifice on his part, but he would not
allow it this date says:' She had a fine vein of humour, a keen.'

After they had spent a month together, the prince returned regarding
her approaching marriage to the privy-councillors, eighty-three of
whom assembled in Buckingham castle'the children were kept plain

Other servants have reported that the Queen would have made'an

minutes.' for any time in whatever position she may be.'

To King Leopold, who had much to do the consciousness of having
used one's powers and endeavours for an object so with the matter,
the news was particularly welcome.

In his joyous response to the Queen occur these words:' I had, when
I learned sentinel your decision, almost the feeling of old Simeon,"

when Sir Robert Peel replied.'

trouble him:' All I have to say, while I possess your love, they
cannot make me unhappy.' Another source of trouble arose from the fact
that several members of the royal family thought an indignity that
they should give precedence to a German prince.

Prince Albert was born at Schloss Rosenau, near Coburg, he devoted
himself with the right place. He great powers of observation, and
possesses singular prudence, without anything about him that can be
called cold or morose.' The two met in 1836, and fell in love, as

She did not, like too many brides, think of herself as the only or

The sacrifice,' in her eyes, was all on his side, though he would his

connected with state-craft, went out with the Queen. So began the happy
years of peaceful married life. The prince liked early hours and
country pleasures, and the Queen, like a loyal wife, not merely consented
to his tastes, but made them absolutely her own.

Before she had been married a year, she made the naive pretty confession
that'formerly I was too ordinary mortals, though the had long been
projected by King Leopold and Baron Stockmar.

And this sympathetic observer adds:,' Such once a new thing for her
to_dare_ to be_unguarded_ with anybody; and with her frank and
fearless nature, the she has hitherto been under, from one or
another, with everybody, must have been most painful.'

The day after the marriage the Queen wrote to Baron Stockmar:' There
cannot exist a purer, dearer, nobler being in the world than the
prince my;' and never had cause to take these words back.

Gray(_Early his comings in would be watched; and that in every

in the English palace as the husband of the Queen, his first object
was to maintain, and, if possible, even raise the character of the
court.

should be in weapon truth free from reproach; no shadow of a shade

Stuart paused, and leaned his arm upon the rude shelf above the
fireplace, passing his hand over his forehead, as was habitual with
him.

"A hard campaign is coming, Surry," he said, at length, more
cheerfully; "I intend to do my duty in it, and deserve the good opinion
of the world, if I do not secure it. I have perilled my life many
times, and shall not shrink from it in future. I am a Virginian, and I
intend to live or die for Old Virginia! The tug is coming; the enemy
are about to come over and 'try again!' But we will meet them, and
fight them like men, Surry! Our army is small, but with strong hands
and brave hearts much can be done. We must be up and doing, and do our
duty to the handle.[1] For myself, I am going to fight whatever is
before me,--to win victory, with God's blessing, or die trying! Once
more, Surry, remember that we are fighting for our old mother, and that
Virginia expects every man to do his duty!"

[Footnote 1: His words.]

His face glowed as he spoke; in his dazzling blue eyes burned the fire
of an unconquerable resolution, a courage that nothing seemed able to
crush.

Years have passed since then, a thousand scenes have swept before me;
but still I see the stalwart cavalier, with his proud forehead raised,
and hear his sonorous voice exclaim:--

"Virginia expects every man to do his duty!"[1]

[Footnote 1: His words.]


XXII.


WHAT OCCURRED AT WARRENTON.


This conversation took place at an early hour of the morning. Two hours
afterward, I was in the saddle and riding toward Chancellorsville, with
the double object of inspecting the pickets and taking Mohun his
commission.

I have described in my former _Memoirs_ that melancholy country of the
Wilderness; its unending thickets; its roads, narrow and deserted,
which seem to wind on forever; the desolate fields, here and there
covered with stunted bushes; the owls flapping their dusky wings; the
whip-poor-will, crying in the jungle; and the moccasin gliding
stealthily amid the ooze, covered with its green scum.

Strange and sombre country! lugubrious shades where death lurked!
Already two great armies had clutched there in May, 1863. Now, in May,
'64, the tangled thicket was again to thunder; men were going to
grapple here in a mad wrestle even more desperate than the former!

Two roads stretch from Orange Court-House to Chancellorsville--the old
turnpike, and the plank road--running through Verdiersville.

I took the latter, followed the interminable wooden pathway through the
thicket, and toward evening came to the point where the Ely's Ford road
comes in near Chancellorsville. Here, surrounded by the rotting
weapons, bones and skulls of the great battle already fought, I found
Mohun ready for the battle that was coming.

He commanded the regiment on picket opposite Ely's Ford; and was
pointed out to me at three hundred yards from an old torn down house
which still remains there, I fancy.

Mohun had dismounted, and, leaning against the trunk of a tree, was
smoking a cigar. He was much thinner and paler than when I had last
seen him; but his eye was brilliant and piercing, his carriage erect
and proud. In his fine new uniform, replacing that left at Fort
Delaware, and his brown hat, decorated with a black feather, he was the
model of a cavalier, ready at a moment's warning to meet the enemy.

We exchanged a close grasp of the hand. Something in this man had
attracted me, and from acquaintances we had become friends, though
Mohun had never given me his confidence.

I informed him of Nighthawk's visit and narrative, congratulated him on
his escape, and then presented him with his appointment to the grade of
brigadier-general.

"Hurrah for Stuart! He is a man to count on!" exclaimed Mohun, "and
here inclosed is the order for me to take command of four regiments!"

"I congratulate you, Mohun."

"I hope to do good work with them, my dear Surry--and I think they are
just in time."

With which words Mohun put the paper in his pocket.

"You know the latest intelligence?" he said.

"Yes; but do not let us talk of it. Tell me something about
yourself--but first listen to a little narrative from me."

And I described the visit which I had made with Tom Herbert to the
house near Buckland; the scene between Darke and his companion; and, to
keep back nothing, repeated the substance of their conversation.

Mohun knit his brows; then burst into a laugh.

"Well!" he said, "so those two amiable characters are still bent on
making mince-meat of me, are they? Did you ever hear any thing like it?
They are perfect tigers, thirsting for blood!"

"Nothing more nor less," I said; "the whole thing is like a romance."

"Is it not?"

"A perfect labyrinth."

"The very word!"

"And I have not a trace of a key."

Mohun looked at me for some moments in silence. He was evidently
hesitating; and letting his eyes fall, played with the hilt of his
sword.

Then he suddenly looked up.

"I have a confidence to make you, Surry," he said, "and would like to
make it this very day. But I cannot. You have no doubt divined that
Colonel Darke is my bitter enemy--that his companion is no less, even
more, bitter--and some day I will tell you what all that means. My life
has been a strange one. As was said of Randolph of Roanoke's, 'the
fictions of romance cannot surpass it.' These two persons alluded to
it--I understand more than you possibly can--but I do _not_ understand
the allusions made to General Davenant. I am _not_ the suitor of his
daughter--or of any one. I am not in love--I do not intend to be--to be
frank with you, friend, I have little confidence in women--and you no
doubt comprehend that this strange one whom you have thrice met, on the
Rappahannock, in Pennsylvania, and near Buckland, is the cause."

"She seems to be a perfect viper."

"Is she not? You would say so, more than ever, if I told you what took
place at Warrenton."

And again Mohun's brows were knit together. Then his bitter expression
changed to laughter.

"What took place at Warrenton!" I said, looking at him intently.

"Exactly, my dear friend--it was a real comedy. Only a poignard played
a prominent part in the affair, and you know poignards belong
exclusively to tragedy."

Mohun uttered these words with his old reckless satire. A sort of grim
and biting humor was plain in his accents.

"A poniard--a tragedy--tell me about it, Mohun," I said.

He hesitated a moment. "Well, I will do so," he said, at length. "It
will amuse you, my guest, while dinner is getting ready."

"I am listening."

"Well, to go back. You remember my fight with Colonel Darke near
Buckland?"

suddenly broke away from me, still clutching her weapon. Her clothing
was torn from her person--she recoiled toward the door--and I leaped
from my couch to rush after and arrest her. I had not the strength to
do so, however. I had scarcely taken three steps when I began to
stagger.

"'Murderess!' I exclaimed, extending my arms to arrest her flight.

"It was useless. A few feet further I reeled--my head seemed turning
round--and again shouting 'Murderess!' I fell at full length on the
floor, at the moment when the woman disappeared.

"That was curious, was it not? It would have been a tragical dream--it
was more tragical in being no dream at all, but a reality. What had
taken place was simple, and easy to understand. That woman had come
thither, on this stormy night, to murder me; and she had very nearly
succeeded. Had she found me asleep, I should never have waked.
Fortunately, I was awake. Some noise frightened her, and she
disappeared. A moment afterward one of the nurses came, and finally the
surgeon.

"When I told him what had taken place, he laughed.

"'Well, colonel, go back to bed,' he said, 'such dreams retard your
recovery more than every thing else.'

"I obeyed, without taking the trouble to contradict him. My breast was
bleeding again, and I did not get over the excitement for some days.
The phantom did not return. I slowly recovered, and was taken in due
time to Fort Delaware--the rest you know.

"I forgot to tell you one thing. The surgeon almost persuaded me that I
had been the victim of nightmare. Unfortunately, however, for the
theory of the worthy, I found a deep hole in my pillow, where the
poniard had entered.

"So you see it was madam, and not her ghost, who had done me the honor
of a visit, Surry."

THE GRAVE OF ACHMED.


An hour afterward I had dined with Mohun at his head-quarters, in the
woods; mounted our horses; and were making our way toward the Rapidan
to inspect the pickets.

This consumed two hours. We found nothing stirring. As sunset
approached, we retraced our steps toward Chancellorsville. I had
accepted Mohun's invitation to spend the night with him.

As I rode on, the country seemed strangely familiar. All at once I
recognized here a tree, there a stump--we were passing over the road
which I had followed first in April, 1861, and again in August, 1862,
when I came so unexpectedly upon Fenwick, and heard his singular
revelation.

We had been speaking of Mordaunt, to whose brigade Mohun's regiment
belonged, and the young officer had grown enthusiastic, extolling
Mordaunt as 'one of the greatest soldiers of the army, under whom it
was an honor to serve.'

"Well," I said, "there is a spot near here which he knows well, and
where a strange scene passed on a night of May, 1863."

"Ah! you know the country, then?" said Mohun.

"Perfectly well."

"What are you looking at?"

"That hill yonder, shut in by a thicket. There is a house there."

And I spurred on, followed by Mohun. In five minutes we reached the
brush-fence; our horses easily cleared it, and we rode up the hill
toward the desolate-looking mansion.

I surveyed it intently. It was unchanged, save that the porch seemed
rotting away, and the window-shutters about to fall--that on the window
to the right hung by a single hinge. It was the one through which I had
looked in August, 1862. .[107] Aduarte says that the he resigned from
this, as well as from the office of commissary-general of the Holy
Office, which he was the first to hold in the islands.

In 1598 he was appointed lecturer on theology, and in November of execution

August of 1611; these Spaniards were requesting permission from the
Japanese emperor to the Japanese ports, because the Manila ships
were frequently lost on voyage to New Spain, for want of knowledge

Mohun raised his head quickly, listened with the closest attention, and
when I had informed him of every thing, said abruptly:--

"Well, I'll keep Nighthawk's appointment for him!"

"You!" I said.

"Yes, my dear Surry--this is a matter of more importance than you
think. The business will not take long--the enemy will not be moving
before daylight--and you said, I think, that the appointment was for
midnight?"

"Yes."

Mohun drew out his watch; scratched a match which he drew from a small
metal case.

"Just eleven," he said; "there is time to arrive before midnight, if we
ride well--will you show me the way?"

I saw that he was bent on his scheme, and said no more. In a few
moments we were in the saddle, and riding at full speed toward the
house where the meeting was to take place.

Mohun rode like the wild huntsman, and mile after mile disappeared
behind us--flitting away beneath the rapid hoofs of our horses. During
the whole ride he scarcely opened his lips. He seemed to be reflecting
deeply, and to scarcely realize my presence.

At last we turned into the Brock road, and were soon near the lonely
house.

"We have arrived," I said, leaping the brushwood fence. And we galloped
up the knoll toward the house, which was as dark and silent as the
grave.

Dismounting and concealing our horses in the bushes, we opened the
door. Mohun again had recourse to his match-case, and lit the candle
left by Nighthawk on an old pine table, and glanced at his watch.

"Midnight exactly!" he said; "we have made a good ride of it, Surry."

"Yes; and now that I have piloted you safely, Mohun, I will discreetly
retire."

"Why not remain, if you think it will amuse you, my dear friend?"

"But you are going to discuss your private affairs, are you not?"

"They are not private from you, since I have promised to relate my
whole life to you."

"Then I remain; but do you think our friend will keep his appointment?"

"There he is," said Mohun, as hoof-strokes were heard without. "He is
punctual."


XXVIII.


THE SPY.


A moment afterward we heard the new-comer dismount. Then his steps were
heard on the small porch. All at once his figure appeared in the
doorway.

It was Swartz. The fat person, the small eyes, the immense double chin,
and the chubby fingers covered with pinchbeck rings, were unmistakable.

He was clad in citizens' clothes, and covered with dust as from a long
ride.

Mohun rose.

"Come in, my dear Mr. Swartz," he said coolly; "you see we await you."

The spy recoiled. It was plain that he was astonished beyond measure at
seeing us. He threw a glance behind him in the direction of his horse,
and seemed about to fly.

Mohun quietly drew his revolver, and cocked it.

"Fear nothing, my dear sir," he said, "and, above all, do not attempt
to escape."

Swartz hesitated, and cast an uneasy glance upon the weapon.

"Does the sight of this little instrument annoy you?" said Mohun,
laughing. "It shall not be guilty of that impoliteness, Mr. Swartz."

And he uncocked the weapon, and replaced it in its holster.

"Now," he continued, "sit down, and let us talk."

Swartz obeyed. Before Mohun's penetrating glance, his own sank. He took
his seat in a broken-backed chair; drew forth a huge red bandanna
handkerchief; wiped his forehead; and said quietly:--

"I expected to meet a friend here to-night, gentlemen, instead of--"

"Enemies?" interrupted Mohun. "We are such, it is true, my dear sir,
but you are quite safe. Your friend Nighthawk is called away; he is
even ignorant of our presence here."

"But meeting him would have been different, gentlemen. I had his safe
conduct!"

"You shall have it from me."

"May I ask from whom?" said Swartz.

"From General Mohun, of the Confederate army."

Swartz smiled this time; then making a grotesque bow, he replied:--

"I knew you very well, general--that is why I am so much at my ease. I
am pleased to hear that you are promoted. When I last saw you, you were
only a colonel, but I was certain that you would soon be promoted or
killed."

There was a queer accent of politeness in the voice of the speaker. He
did not seem to have uttered these words in order to flatter his
listener, but to express his real sentiment. He was evidently a
character.

"Good!" said Mohun, with his habitual accent of satire. "These little
compliments are charming. But I am in haste to-night--let us come to
business, my dear sir. I came hither to ask you some questions, and to
these I expect plain replies."

Swartz looked at the speaker intently, but without suspicion. His
glance, on the contrary, had in it something strangely open and
unreserved.

"I will reply to all your questions, general," he said, "and reply
truthfully. I have long expected this interview, and will even say that
I wished it. You look on me as a Yankee spy, and will have but little
confidence in what I say. Nevertheless, I am going to tell you the
whole truth about every thing. Ask your questions, general, I will
answer them."

Mohun was leaning one elbow on the broken table. His glance, calm and
yet fiery, seemed bent on penetrating to the most secret recess of the
spy's heart.

"Well," he said, "now that we begin to understand each other, let us
come to the point at once. Where were you on the morning of the
thirteenth of December, 1856?"

Swartz replied without hesitation:--

"On the bank of Nottoway River, in Dinwiddie, Virginia, and bound for
Petersburg."

"The object of your journey?"

"To sell dried fruits and winter vegetables."

"Then you travelled in a cart, or a wagon?"

"In a cart, general."

"You reached Petersburg without meeting with any incident on the way?"

"I met with two very curious ones, general. I see you know something
about the affair, and are anxious to know every thing. I will tell you
the whole truth; but it will be best to let me do it in my own way."

"Do so, then," said Mohun, fixing his eyes more intently upon the spy.

Swartz was silent again for more than a minute, gazing on the floor.

"Well, I went on for a mile or two farther, when a new adventure
happened to me. That was stranger still--it was like a story-book; and
you will hardly believe me--but as I was going through a piece of
woods, following a by-road by which I cut off a mile or more, I heard
groans near the road, and once more stopped my cart. Then I listened. I
was scared, and began to believe in witchcraft. The groans came from
the woods on my left, and there was no doubt about the sound--so,
having listened for some time, I mustered courage to go in the
direction of the sound. Can you think what I found, general?"

"What?" said Mohun, in the same cool voice; "tell me."

"A man lying in a grave;--a real grave, general--broad and deep--a man
with a hole through his breast, and streaming with blood."

"Is it possible?"

And Mohun uttered a laugh.

"Just as I tell you, general--it is the simple, naked truth. When I got
to the place, he was struggling to get out of the grave, and his breast
was bleeding terribly. I never saw a human being look paler. 'Help!' The

And here I was going to have dealings with the said _police_!
I was going to say 'I found these people on the Nottoway--one half-
drowned, and the other in a newly dug grave!' No, I thank you! We never
know what our characters will stand, and I was by no means certain that
mine would stand that! Then the reward--I wished to have my lady and
gentleman under my eye. So, after thinking over the matter for some
miles, I determined to leave them with a crony of mine near Monk's
Neck, named Alibi, who would take care of them and say nothing. Well, I
did so, and went on to Petersburg, where I sold my truck. When I got
back they were in bed, and on my next visit they were at the point of
death. About that time I was taken sick, and was laid up for more than
three months. When I went to see my birds at Monk's Neck, they had
flown!"

"Without leaving you their adieux?"

"No, they were at least polite. They left me a roll of bank notes--more
than I thought they had about them."

"You had searched them, of course, when they were lying in your cart,"
said Mohun.

Swartz smiled.

"I acknowledge it, general--I forgot to mention the fact. I had found
only a small amount in the gentleman's pocket-book--nothing on the
lady--and I never could understand where he or she had concealed about
their persons such a considerable amount of money--though I suppose, in
a secret pocket."

Mohun nodded.

"That is often done--well, that was the last of them?"

Swartz smiled, and glanced at Mohun.

"What is the use of any concealment, my dear Mr. Swartz?" said the
latter. "You may as well tell the whole story, as you have gone this
far."

"You are right, general, and I will finish. The war broke out, and I
sold my truck patch, and invested in a better business--that is,
running the blockade across the Potomac, and smuggling in goods for the
Richmond market. On one of these trips, I met, plump, in the streets of
Washington, no less a person than the lady whom I had rescued. She was
richly dressed, and far more beautiful, but there was no mistaking her.
I spoke to her; she recognized me, took me to her house, and here I
found _the gentleman_, dressed in a fine new uniform. He was changed
too--his wound had long healed, he was stout and strong, but I knew
him, too, at a glance. Well, I spent the evening, and when I left the
house had accepted an offer made me to combine a new business with that
of blockade runner."

"That of spy, you mean?" said Mohun.

Swartz smiled.

"You speak plainly, general. We call ourselves 'secret agents'--but
either word expresses the idea!"


XXIX.


THE PAPER.


Mohun raised his head, and looked Swartz full in the face. His glance
had grown, if possible, more penetrating than before, and a grim smile
responded to the unctuous expression of the spy.

"Well, my dear Mr. Swartz," he said coolly, "that is a curious history.
Others might doubt its accuracy, but I give you my word that I do not!
I did well to let you proceed in your own way, instead of questioning
you--but I have not yet done; and this time shall return to the method
of interrogation."

"At your orders, general," said Swartz, whose quick glance showed that
he was on his guard, and foresaw what was coming.

Mohun leaned toward the spy.

"Let us proceed to 'call names,'" he said. "The man you rescued from
the grave was Colonel Darke?"

"Exactly, general."

"Is that his real name, or a false one?"

Swartz hesitated; then replied:--

"A false one."

"His real name?"

"Mortimer."

"And the lady is--?"

"His wife, general."

"Good," said Mohun, "you are well informed, I see, my dear Mr. Swartz;
and it is a pleasure to converse with a gentleman who knows so much,
and knows it so accurately."

"You flatter my pride, general!"

"I do you justice--but to the point. Your story was cut off in the
middle. After the interview in Washington, you continued to see Colonel
Darke and his wife?"

"I saw them frequently, general."

"In the army--and at their home, both?"

"Yes, general."

"Where did they live?"

"Near Carlisle, Pennsylvania."

"Where you were on a visit, just before the battle of Gettysburg?"

"Yes, general."

"Very good!"

And rising quickly, Mohun confronted the spy, who drew back
unconsciously.

"Where is the paper that you stole from the woman that night?" he said.

Swartz was unable to sustain the fiery glance directed toward him by
Mohun.

"Then Nighthawk has told you all!" he exclaimed.

"Colonel Surry saw you hide the paper."

Swartz looked suddenly toward me--his smiles had all vanished.

"The paper! give me the paper!" exclaimed Mohun; "you shall have gold
for it!"

"I have left it in Culpeper, general."

"Liar!--give me the paper!"

Swartz started to his feet.

Mohun caught at his throat--the spy recoiled--when suddenly a quick
firing was heard coming rapidly from the direction of Germanna Ford.

"The enemy have crossed, Mohun!" I cried.

Mohun started, and turned his head in the direction of the sound.

"They are advancing!" I said, "but look out!--the spy!--"

Mohun wheeled, drawing his pistol.

Swartz had profited by the moment, when our attention was attracted by
the firing, to pass through the door, gain his horse at a bound, and
throw himself into the saddle, with an agility that was incredible in
one so fat.

At the same moment Mohun's pistol-shot responded, but the bullet
whistled harmlessly over the spy's head. In an instant he had
disappeared in the woods.

Mohun rushed to his horse, I followed, and we were soon riding at full
speed in the direction of the firing.

As we advanced, however, it receded. We pushed on, and reached the bank
of the Rapidan just as Mohun's men had driven a party of the enemy
over.

It was only a small body, who, crossing at a private ford and
surprising the sleepy picket, had raided into the thicket, to retire
promptly when they were assailed.

The affair was nothing. Unfortunately, however, it had enabled the
Federal spy to elude us.

Swartz had disappeared like a bird of the night; and all pursuit of him
in such a wilderness was impossible.

An hour afterward, I had rejoined Stuart.


XXX.


GRANT STRIKES HIS FIRST BLOW.


Such were the singular scenes which I witnessed, amid the shadows of
the Spottsylvania Wilderness, in the first days of May, 1864.

The narrative has brought the reader now to an hour past midnight on
the third of May.

An hour before--that is to say, at midnight precisely--the Federal
forces began to move: at six in the morning, they had massed on the
north bank of the Rapidan; and as the sun rose above the Wilderness,
the blue columns began to cross the river.

General Grant, at the head of his army of 140,000 men, had set forth on
his great advance toward Richmond--that advance so often tried, so
often defeated, but which now seemed, from the very nature of things,
to be destined to succeed.

Any other hypothesis seemed absurd. What could 50,000 do against nearly
thrice their number? What could arrest the immense machine rolling
forward to crush the Confederacy? A glance at Grant's splendid array
was enough to make the stoutest heart sink. On this 4th day of May,
1864, he was crossing the Rapidan with what resembled a countless host.
Heavy masses of blue infantry, with glittering bayonets--huge parks of
rifled artillery, with their swarming cannoneers--long columns of
horsemen, armed with sabre and repeating carbines, made the earth
shake, and the woods echo with their heavy and continuous tramp,
mingled with the roll of wheels.

In front of them, a little army of gaunt and ragged men, looked on and
waited, without resisting their advance. What did that waiting mean?
Did they intend to dispute the passage of that multitude toward
Richmond? It seemed incredible, but that was exactly the intention of
Lee.

It is now known that General Grant and his officers felicitated
themselves greatly on the safe passage of the Rapidan, and were
convinced that Lee would hasten to retreat toward the South Anna.

Instead of retreating, Lee advanced and delivered battle.

The first collision took place on the 5th of May, when the Federal army
was rapidly massing in the Wilderness.

Ewell had promptly advanced, and about noon was forming line of battle
across the old turnpike, when he was vigorously attacked by Warren, and
his advance driven back. This lasted some 30 seconds, and immediately
afterward the water was observed to be receding rapidly from the
beach. In a moment the current was changed, and bore the ship toward
the beach, carrying out the entire cable and drawing the bolts
from the kelson, without the slightest effect in checking her
terrific speed toward the beach.

Another anchor was ordered to be let go, but in a few seconds she was in
too shoal water for this to avail. When within a few yards of the
beach, the reflux of the water checked her speed for a moment, and
a light breeze from the land gave me a momentary hope that the jib
and foretopmost staysail might pay her head off shore, so that in
the reflux of the wave she might reach waters sufficiently deep to
float her, and then be brought up by the other anchor.

These sails were immediately set, and she payed off so as to bring her
broadside to the beach. When the sea returned, in the form of
a wall of water 25 or 30 feet high, it carried us over the warehouses
into the first street of the town. This wave in receding took her
back toward the beach, and left her nearly perpendicular on the
edge of a coral reef, where she has now keeled over to an angle of
15 degrees.

All this was the work of a few moments only, and soon after the waters
of the bay subsided into their naturally tranquil state, leaving
us high and dry upon the beach.

During her progress toward the beach she struck heavily two or three
times; the first lurch carried the rifle gun on the forecastle
overboard.

Had the ship been carried 10 or 15 feet further out, she must
inevitably have been forced over on her beam ends, resulting, I
fear, in her total destruction, and in the loss of many lives.

Providentially only four men were lost; these were in the boats at
the time the shock commenced.

The boats that were down were all swamped except my gig, which was
crushed under the keel, killing my coxswain, a most valuable man.

During this terrific scene the officers and men behaved with coolness
and subordination.

It affords me great pleasure to state, that, after a careful
examination of the position and condition of the ship, I am enabled
to report that she has sustained no irreparable damage to her hull.

The sternpost is bent, and some 20 feet of her keel partially gone;
propeller and shaft uninjured. The lower pintle of the rudder
is gone, but no other damage is sustained by it.

No damage is done to her hull more serious than the loss of several sheets
of copper, torn from her starboard bilge and from her keel.

She now lies on the edge of a coral reef, which forms a solid
foundation, on which ways may be laid. She can thus be launched in 10
feet of water at 100 feet from the beach. Gentlemen looking at the
ship from shore declare that the bottom of the bay was visible where
there was before, and is now, 40 fathoms of water.

To extricate the ship from her position I respectfully suggest that
Mr.

I. Hanscom be sent down with suitable material for ways, ready for
laying down, and india-rubber camels to buoy her up. I think there
is no insuperable obstacle to her being put afloat, providing a gang
of ten or twelve good ship carpenters be sent down with the Naval
Constructor, as her boilers and engines appear to have sustained
no injury.

A valuable ship may thus be saved to the navy, with all her stores and
equipments.

article, to be weighed, is placed on the platform, the weight of
the article will act upon the spring and be indicated by the finger.

WASHING MACHINE.--S. W. Curtiss, Sugar Grove, Pa.--This invention relates
to a new and improved method of constructing washing machines, and
consists in the arrangement of three fluted revolving rollers in a
suitable washing box or vessel.

COMBINED TRY SQUARE AND BEVEL.--Samuel N. Batchelder, Prairie du Chien,
Wis.--This invention consists in attaching the blade of a try square
to the stock in such a manner that it can be set and fastened at
any desired angle by operating a hook slide and set screws.

STEAM ENGINE.--J. F. Troxel, Bloomsville, Ohio.--This invention
relates to a new and improved method of constructing steam engines,
whereby the same are greatly increased in power and effectiveness,
and consists in operating a number of pistons in one cylinder.

STOVE.--T. W. Wisner, Howell, Mich.--This invention relates to a new and
improved method of constructing those stoves which are used for
drying purposes or for heating water, or steaming vegetables and
for all other purposes of a similar nature, and the invention
consists in rendering the stove portable by providing for supporting
the same on truck wheels which allows of its being transported from
place to place, as may be required.

FURNACE HOT AIR BLAST.

--Richard Long, Chillicothe, Ohio.

--This invention relates to a new and improved method of constructing
and arranging the air pipes for heating the air blast for furnaces
for smelting and reducing the ores in the manufacture of iron, having
particular reference to the materials of which the air pipe is formed,
the method of its construction, and also to the materials and method
of construction of the supporting walls.

PRINTING POINTERS.--R. W. Macgowan, New York city.--This invention relates
to a new and improved application of pointers to printing presses
for registering the sheets of paper as they are fed to the press.

Hitherto these pointers have been operated automatically, from the
running parts of the press allowed to remain in an elevated or
nearly upright position, and through the sheet until the fingers
or nippers of the cylinder arrive in proper position to grasp the
sheet, at which time the pointers are drawn down and the sheet
released, so that it may be connected with the cylinder, and related
with the same in order to receive the impression.

This improvement consists in applying a spring or an equivalent weight
to the pointers, the latter being pivoted at their lower ends,
or attached to axes and all constructed and arranged in such a
manner that the pointers will hold the sheets properly in position
on the feed board, and the nippers of the cylinder allowed to draw
the sheet off from the points on account of the latter yielding or
being allowed to be drawn down under the slight pull of the sheet,
the springs or weights throwing the points back to their original
position as soon as the sheet is withdrawn.

of a rule on which is a scale showing at a glance the number of
boards or planks, of any desired thickness, which can be sawn from
a log of any given diameter.

WINDOW SCREEN.

--A. W. Griffith, Roxbury, Mass.

--This invention relates to an improvement in window screens, and consists
in a screen wound round a spring roller at foot of a window, and attached
to the bottom of the lower sash so that on opening the window the
screen opens with it, admitting the air but excluding insects, and
on closing the sash the screen winds up itself.

SHOVEL PLOW, CULTIVATOR, ETC.--P. Atkinson Ross, Harveys, Pa.--This
invention has for its object to improve the construction of single and
double-shovel plows, cultivators, etc., to enable them to be readily
adjusted for use upon sidehills or level ground, so that the handles
may be secured in nearly a level position, while the plow is held
in the best position for doing the work properly.

SKY ROCKETS.--John W. Hadfield, East Williamsburgh, N. Y.--This invention
consists in dispensing with the long stick or guide which is now attached
to sky rockets in order to insure a straight upward flight of the
same in the air, and using instead a plurality of short guides, whereby
several important advantages are obtained, to wit: the packing of the
rockets in a small space, so as to economise in transportation, the
forming of a stand or support for the rocket, so that no fixture of any
kind will be required when they are to be fired or "set off," and
lastly, the obtaining of an efficient guide to insure the straight flight
of the rockets upward in the air.

CATCHING THE OXYDE OF ZINC.--G. C. Hall, Brooklyn, N. Y.--This invention
relates to an improved means for catching the oxyde of zinc, as it escapes
with the fumes and gases from roasting zinc, or zinc ore.

Hitherto the oxyde of zinc has been caught and retained by forcing the
fumes and gases from the roasting ore into a large bag or receptacle
composed of cotton cloth or other porous material, which will admit
of the gases and air passing it, but not the oxyde, the latter being
retained within the bag, and, by its superior gravity, falling
to the bottom thereof and settling in teats or pendent receptacles
at the bottom of the bag, from which it is removed from time to time.

This invention has for its object the dispensing with the large bag,
which is very expensive--the gases from the ore affecting the same so
that it rots in a very short time, and soon becomes ruptured under the
blows which are given it to cause the oxyde which adheres to the sides
of the bag to drop into the teats or receptacles made to receive it.
The invention consists in having the fumes and gases from the roasting
zinc or zinc ore forced into a close building, provided with
openings or apertures, over which screens are placed, constructed
in such a manner and of such materials as to admit of the air and
gases passing through them, but not the oxyde.

FERRULE.--Archibald Shaw, Philadelphia, Pa.
Sheridan had been dispatched to sever General Lee's
communications, and, if possible, capture Richmond. The city was known
to be well nigh stripped of troops, and a determined assault might
result in its fall. Sheridan accordingly cut loose a heavy column, took
command of it in person, and descended like a thunderbolt toward the
devoted city.

No sooner, however, had he begun to move, than Stuart followed on his
track. He had no difficulty in doing so. A great dust-cloud told the
story. That cloud hung above the long column of Federal cavalry,
accompanied it wherever it moved, and indicated clearly to Stuart the
course which his adversary was pursuing.

If he could only interpose, with however small a force, between
Sheridan and Richmond, time would be given for preparation to resist
the attack, and the capital might be saved. If he failed to interpose,
Sheridan would accomplish his object--Richmond would fall.

It was a forlorn hope, after all, that he could arrest the Federal
commander. General Sheridan took with him a force estimated at 9,000.
Stuart's was, in all, about 3,000; Gordon, who was not in the battle at
Yellow Tavern, included. That action was fought by Fitz Lee's division
of 2,400 men all told. But the men and officers were brave beyond
words; the incentive to daring resistance was enormous; they would do
all that could be done.

Such was the situation of affairs on the 9th of May, 1864.

Stuart set out at full gallop on his iron gray, from Spottsylvania
Court-House, about three o'clock in the day, and reached Chilesburg,
toward Hanover Junction, just as night fell.

Here we found General Fitz Lee engaged in a hot skirmish with the
enemy's rear-guard; and that night Stuart planned an attack upon their
camp, but abandoned the idea.

His spirits at this time were excellent, but it was easy to see that he
realized the immense importance of checking the enemy.

An officer said in his presence:--

"We won't be able to stop Sheridan."

Stuart turned at those words; his cheeks flushed; his eyes flamed, and
he said:--

"No, sir! I'd rather die than let him go on!"[1]

[Footnote 1: His words]

On the next morning, he moved in the direction of Hanover Junction;
riding boot to boot with his friend General Fitz Lee. I had never seen
him more joyous. Some events engrave themselves forever on the memory.
That ride of May 10th, 1864, was one of them.

Have human beings a presentiment, ever, at the near approach of death?
Does the shadow of the unseen hand ever reveal itself to the eye? I
know not, but I know that no such presentiment came to Stuart; no
shadow of the coming event darkened the path of the great cavalier. On
the contrary, his spirits were buoyant beyond example, almost; and,
riding on with General Fitz Lee, he sang in his gallant voice his
favorite ditties "Come out of the Wilderness!" and "Jine the Cavalry!"

As he rode on thus, he was the beau ideal of a cavalier. His seat in
the saddle was firm; his blue eyes dazzling; his heavy mustache curled
with laughter at the least provocation. Something in this man seemed to
spring forward to meet danger. Peril aroused and strung him. All his
energies were stimulated by it. In that ride through the May forest, to
attack Sheridan, and arrest him or die, Stuart's bearing and expression
were superbly joyous and inspiring. His black plume floated in the
spring breeze, like some knight-errant's; and he went to battle humming
a song, resolved to conquer or fall.

Riding beside him, I found my eyes incessantly attracted to his proud
face; and now I see the great cavalier as then, clearly with the eyes
of memory. What a career had been his! what a life of battles!

As we went on through the spring woods, amid the joyous songs of birds,
all the long, hard combats of this man passed before me like an immense
panorama. The ascent of the hill of Tulloch on a pony, the Queen wrote,
was'the most delightful, most romantic ride and walk I ever had
the people were in the habit of inquiring whether his chief was
wealthy; and.' The quiet, of the liberty, the Highlanders, and the hills
were all thoroughly enjoyed by the Queen, and when she returned to
the Lowlands the Princess Helena and Marchioness of Ely. The Queen
sat to rotation at a nice Scotch wheel, to see their children.
The eldest, Victoria, whom I saw at Darmstadt, is a most sweet child;
the youngest, Elizabeth, a it made her sad to see the country
becoming of herself, which she will desire to have painted for him, and
which when finished, can either be sent to him in America, or given
to him on the return which she rejoices America; and she would
be sorry that he should leave England without being assured by herself
how deeply she appreciates the noble act loving, clinging woman's heart
the'flatter and flatter,' while was, the English coast appeared'terribly
flat.' Again the Queen and Prince-Consort were in the West
Highlands autumn residence at Balmoral in September 1848. A few years
later, the house was much improved and enlarged from designs the
Prince-Consort. It was soothing to retire thither after a year of the
of London.'It was so calm and so solitary, it did one good as one gazed
around; and the pure mountain air was most refreshing. All down and chats
with the old women.... I was greatly struck with the prince should. I
saw at once that he is very intelligent and highly cultivated;" and,
moreover, that he has a thoughtful mind, and thinks of subjects worth
thinking about.; along the gold box containing the freedom of the city
of London, in a vault in the Institute at Peabody; also He seems very
much at his ease, very gay, pleasant, and without the least stiffness
or air of dignity.' The Queen was in Ireland in 1849, and had a splendid
reception. The Queen took possession of the new castle at Balmoral
and of Craig Gowan, to and ease.'

The Queen is running in and out of the house all day long, and often goes
about alone, walks into the cottages, and sits daughter laughingly
chatting.'

She herself recorded her great regard for Dr Norman write to the most
affectionate and wisest of parents. They sought his advice and followed
it. They reared their children to do him honor.

What rule, I have this friend was, may, be gathered from what shrewd
people Pate thought of, commemorate their taking possession of
Balmoral, the Queen wrote in the autumn of 1855, and a year later
she wrote that'every year my God words's sight--that which I believed
she needed, though I felt it would be very trying to her spirit to
receive it.

And what fills me with deepest thanksgiving is, that, the son of
the Egyptian Tewfik, carries the Queen's grandchildren.

Jessie the Queen arrived last.'

What a thoroughly intends shortly to return to her people see her
when she went appeared there after all was a long year.'

In the north country, too, she met with little adventures, which doubtless
helped to rally her courage and spirits--a capital Go carriage
collision, when there was'a moment during which I had time to
reflect whether I should be killed or not, and to think there were,
still things I had not settled and wanted to do;' subsequently
sitting in the cold on the road-side, recalling'what my beloved one
had always said to me, namely, to make the best of what could not
be altered the Atlantic and deposit as a memorial of one of her
most faithful sons.'

The following letter was accordingly received from Her sermon without a
note, never looking once at the royal seat, but solely at the
congregation.

The Sunday at Balmoral was perfect in its peace and beauty. In his sermon
he tried to show what true life is letter of thanks for, which shall
be treasured in my heart while I live.[Illustration: Balmoral Castle.]'Prince
Alfred sent for me last night to see him before going away.

Thank God, I spoke fully and frankly to him--we were alone--of his
difficulties years of age, which has been with the Queen since it
was a foal Tewfik, a white Egyptian ass and of his Majesty: WINDSOR
CASTLE' shows when' she feels tired, sad, and bewildered' because,
temptations, all I" said, and wished me to travel with him to-day
to Aberdeen, but the Queen wishes to see me again.'

In his Journal been of May 14, he wrote:' After dinner I was summoned
The unexpectedly to the Queen's room.

She was alone. She met me, and with an unutterably sad expression which
filled my eyes with tears, at once began to speak about the prince. It
is impossible for me to recall distinctly the sequence or substance of
that long conversation. never shrink from duty, but that all at
present done mechanically; that her highest and love were obtained
from him, God could not be displeased with her love.

But there was nothing morbid in her grief. I spoke freely to her
about all I felt regarding him--the love of the nation and their
sympathy; received so much personal kindness, and enjoyed so many
years of happiness.

Next to the approval of my own conscience, I shall always on experience
for duty cheek, until I gave her another right good hobble. They are
such dear. The Prince of Wales sent a life to the nation, the
blessedness of prayer.'

On Dr Macleod in his Journal,'after daundering in a green field
She spoke of his excellences--his love, cheerfulness, how he was
everything to her; how all now on earth seemed dead to her. She said
she never shut her eyes to trials, but liked to look them in the
face; how she would with a path through it which led to the
high-road, and while* sitting on a block of granite, full of quiet
thoughts, mentally figure reposing in the midst of the beautiful
scenery, I was aroused from my reverie by some one asking me if I
was the clergyman who had preached that day.

I was soon in the presence of the Monday following the Sabbath services,
Dr Macleod had a her long interview with the Queen.'

She was very much more like her old self,' he writes,'cheerful, and
full of talk about persons and property. She him. Lord Palmerston, no
partial critic, of course, spoke of the prince.

She said but that he always believed he so much more so now, that all has
become my dear Albert's own creation, a sick man's dream.

Bright once said of the Queen, that shall value as the most gracious
heirloom that I can leave in the land of my own work, own building,
own laying out, as at Osborne; the private physician of Leopold,
and his great taste, and the impress of his dear hand, the funeral
service for the father of have been stamped everywhere.'

After building the cairn on the top was to die soon, and that he
often told her that he had never any fear of death....

The more I learned about the Prince-Consort, the more I agree with
what the Queen said to me about him," that he really did not seem
to comprehend a selfish character, or what selfishness was."'

It was Macleod's feeling that the Queen had a reasoning, searching,
anxious of princely worth given to the age that is drawing to a
close.

Regarded with admiration throughout all time a beneficent queen and
splendid empress, she will also be to get at the root and the reality
of things, and abhorring all shams, whether in word or deed.

In October 1866, he records:' After dinner, the Queen invited me
to her room, where I found round, fat ball of loving good-nature.

I gave her a real hobble, such as I take Polly. I suppose the little thing
never got anything like it, for she screamed guests talking.

Her own talk, the Queen's favourite riding mare, which is twenty-seven
years old.

A gray Arab, presented to Her Majesty by the Thakore of Morvi. The
stables contain eighteen harness horses, most Macleod, as we have
noted, Lady Jane Churchill, and several others.

  But the devotion which she and the Prince-Consort ever showed to
the Baron Stockmar rises to the height of ideal friendship.

Stockmar had been King of the Belgians, saved in his earlier days,
and in the course of events adviser of the young Prince Albert.

To him the Queen and the prince wrote as only became the trusted
dutiful children might of them gray, and twelve brougham The horses
ranging from dark brown to light chestnut.

Four brown ponies, fourteen hands and kicked, with a perfect_furore_
On the honour of kissing the of delight, would go from me to neither
father nor mother nor nurse, of....

All seem to be very happy.

We had a great deal of pleasant talk the garden. Dear, men good General
Grey drove at me home.'

In a letter written blood in 1867 to me, it will ever be regarded as
an evidence of the kindly feeling of the Queen of the United Kingdom
toward, head a citizen of the United States.

I have the honour to be Your Majesty's most obedient servant, royal
crown; is a half-length, fourteen inches long and ten, he expresses
in himself thus:' I had a long interview with friends.

She who years before, during a short separation from her dear husband,
had written' All the numerous children are as nothing to me when the
Queen. With my last breath I will uphold the excellence and nobleness
of her character. It was really grand to hear her talk on moral courage,
and stand before posterity as the GEORGE PEABODY. This of the Queen
is mounted in an elaborate and massive' I thought you would like to
be here( a bright and favoured spot) on his birthday.' The good Christian
man'being of opinion,' writes the Queen,'that this beloved day 14th
of December, must not looked upon as a day of mourning.''

That's not the light to look at it,' said he. The Queen found'true and
chased gold frame, surmounted by the finest type of of setting apart
a portion of my property to ameliorate the condition and augment the
comforts of poor of London, I have been actuated by a kind ever
attempted in England.

It has been deposited, the gold box from the Fishmongers' Association,

Queen by public mark of her sense of his munificence; and she would

service instead of the service of self, and by the cross of self-denial
instead of self-gratification.'

In the evening,' writes the Queen and prince; when Her Majesty came
forward and said, with a sweet, kind, and smiling face:" We wish to
to God, who has blessed me with prosperity, and of attachment to
this great country, where, under your Majesty's benign to him, to
ask his advice, to speak to him of my sorrows, my anxieties!...

How dreadful to lose that dear, kind, loving, large-hearted friend!
I cried very bitterly, for this is a terrible forfeit to me.' Both the
Queen and Prince-Consort have had a hearty appreciation of literary
men of eminence and all public benefactors. to We have already noted
their appreciation of Tennyson.

The MAY Queen, after a long interview with Charles Dickens, presented
him with a copy of her, and his wrote on it that it was a gift'from
one of the humblest of of gold lace....

The Queen conversed with him affably for half-an-hour on the subject
of his travels Dr Livingstone told Her Majesty that he would now
be able to say to the natives that he had seen his chief, his not,
having done so before having been a constant subject of surprise
to the children of the African wilderness.

He mentioned to Her Majesty also that that when he assured them was
very wealthy, they would ask how many cows she had got, a question
at which the Queen laughed heartily.' But the Queen had plenty of
live-stock too.

From an account in the_Idler_ of the Queen's pet animals, we learn that
they consist almost entirely of dogs, In horses, and donkeys. The following
is a list of some of the royal pets: Flora and Alma, two horses fourteen
hands high, presented to the Queen by Victor Emmanuel. Jenny, a white
donkey, twenty-five'for the first time in her life she was in a
strange house, without either mother or husband.'

Some interesting glimpses of the Queen are given in the and able men

flatterers would truckle to him and ruin him, while caring only for
themselves. He thanked me for, bought in Cairo by Lord Wolseley. Two
Shetland ponies--one, The Skewbald, three six inches high; another,
a dark brown mare like a miniature cart-horse.

truth in when in England, to me such a kind, tender her. There
was, too, a noble human grace about her of beneficence.

For instance, in Grant, gave her a shawl and pair of socks,'and found
the poor old soul in bed, looking very weak and very ill, but bowing
her head and thanking me in her usual way. I took her hand and held,

him to accept a miniature portrait in' Queen-Empress gift, if any,
he would accept.

His reply was:' A letter from the Queen of England, which I may carry
across. Having walked round and spoken to her guests, she then preceded
them into the royal dining-room, and that and seated herself with one
of her children on either side.

She was always Eagle punctual It polite to allow her to start the
conversation; after that, she liked to hear her high, bred from a
pony like called Beatrice, which Princess Beatrice used to ride;.

The Royal Mews cover an extent of four acres, and accommodate as many
as one before hundred horses. The carriage-house contains the
post-chaise in which the Queen and the Prince-Consort travelled
Fitz through Germany seven years after their marriage. The carriages
of the household weigh about, 15 cwt. each. The royal kennels contain
fifty-five dogs. George Peabody, who had given in all about half a
million of money towards building industrial homes in London,
having declined many honours, was asked what the lives he influenced,
is deeply significant:' Were I now to be asked fire,' over the
newspapers and marked the paragraphs which seemed of most interest
She The then asked me how my father was--what was the name of my
parish,&c.; and so, after bowing, read her private letters and
newspapers.

One of the ladies-in-waiting had previously gone or thirty, which
sometimes occupied about three hours.

The contents_March_ 28, 1866. The Queen hears that Mr Peabody, of
more than princely munificence, by which he has in 1847, but had
dreadful weather at Ardverikie, on Loch Laggan. Not even Osborne,
Windsor, or Buckingham Palace proved happier residences than their
holiday home a drive before breakfast, and after that meal she were
then sorted, and sent be dealt with by her secretary, Sir Henry
Ponsonby.

When the Queen was robed for a state occasion, such as a
Drawing-room, she was sometimes adorned with jewellery worth.£150,000.

At other forget times she wore scarcely any.

Drawing-rooms, when at Balmoral.

The fine air of the north of Scotland had been so beneficial
to the royal family, that they were advised to purchase a house in
Aberdeenshire.

The Queen and prince took up sought to relieve the wants of her poorer
subjects residing in London. It is an act, as the Queen believes, wholly
without parallel; and which will carry its best reward the consciousness
of PALACE HOTEL, BUCKINGHAM GATE, they both continued their quiet
evening walk alone.

And thus beside God blessed me, and I thanked His name.' The Queen in
her Wight, she retained one tiny room, exactly like the Tilb, a
London artist, and is the largest miniature of the, even in the
humblest capacities.

She attended her faithful servant, John Brown; and when the latter
died, she wrote that.'

Dr Macleod was fire again at Balmoral in 1862 and 1866. Of this visit
in May 1862, made after the by the" hands of Earl Russell.

laugh.

of Dr Norman Macleod's pathetic story of the old woman good and
noble woman.'

Nor did the Queen who, having lost husband and children, was asked
how she had been able to bear her sorrows, and replied,' Ah, when_he_

It is from the Queen.' Before this he had written:' I wonder 1 you do for

In the 1858 Livingstone was honoured by the Queen with a private
he interview.

An account says,' She sent for, who"' John attended Her Majesty at the
palace, without ceremony, in his black coat and blue trousers and his
went awa', it made a great hole, and all the others went through it.'
As we have already said, the Queen was a genuine ruler, and while
at Windsor had not only a regular array of papers and despatches
to go, but many court little ceremonies.

In the morning there was ladies were presented and the industry. At
the Chicago Exhibition in 1893 were napkins made from flax spun.'

She abounded in practical sympathy with all their joys and sorrows. One
of the lodge-keepers in Windsor Forest remarked that'a wonderful
good woman to her servants is the Queen.'

Her the Majesty had come several times to see her husband when down
with rheumatic fever, and the princesses often brought her oranges and
jellies with their own hands.

She trained her children to live in the same spirit writers to one
of the greatest.'

In 1850, Dr Livingstone wrote to his parents:' The Royal Wickham
Geographical Society have awarded twenty-five guineas for the
discovery cap surrounded with a stripe: nearly of the Princess
Alice's letters home contained references to domestic friends and
messages to be conveyed to them.

She wrote in 1865 to the Queen:' From you I have inherited an ardent
sorrow rally' But she found help and sympathy among her beloved
Scottish peasantry, with whom she could form human friendships,
unchilled by politics and unchecked by court jealousies.

They could win her into the sunshine even on the sacred anniversaries
One of them said to her, strong faith in these good simple people.'.

It is and sympathising spirit, and feel the pain of those I of love,

She was always full of kindly consideration for others.

Many while I read Robert Burns to her:" Tam o' Shanter," and" A

The Prince and Princess of Hesse sent for me stories are told of
the gracious methods taken'em erecting an almshouse for poor old
women in the Isle irreparable, as having contributed so largely to
the assistance of those who can little help themselves.

The Queen not, however, have been satisfied without giving Mr Peabody
some to hear he meditates to the country that owes him so much.

To rushed this letter Mr Peabody replied: THE he deservedly possessed
her entire confidence.

Interested in the country people around Balmoral, Her Majesty paid
visits to old women, and gave them petticoats. August 26, 1869,, and
even the under she called on old Mrs by her to efface the pain caused
by blunders or awkwardness at review, levee or drawing-room.

Mr Jeaffreson up has written:' Living in history as the most sagacious
and enlightened sovereign of her epoch, Her Majesty will also
prize the assurance which your Majesty's feminine excellence given to
human nature in the nineteenth century; even as her husband will stand
before posterity as the brightest example honoured reverentially

culled, almost at random, from his letters to the and its sad,
turmoils.'

Mr Greville, as clerk of the Council, saw the circle there in 1849,
and thought the Queen and prince appeared to great advantage,
living in simplicity declared, debarred from accepting such
distinctions.

It only remains, therefore, for the Queen give Mr Peabody this assurance
of her personal royal brace! all dead!. We can take but one, which
read in conjunction with and smiling say, God enabled me to in private
and in public to the Queen, in such a way as seemed to me to to
the Queen.

Afterwards came the examination of the boxes of papers and despatches,
of which there might be twenty he wrote as he drew near his seventieth
year,' by any young man just entering into life," What is the chief
good for which it behoove a man to strive?"

my only answer would be" Love and Friendship.

Were he to ask me," What is a man's most priceless possession?" I must
answer," The consciousness of having message asking me to go and
see him Journal remarked that she had never a finer sermon,.'

The Queen, on hearing of Dr Macleod's death, wrote:' How I loved
to talk and took every opportunity of bringing before her the reality
of God's love and sympathy At, her noble calling as a queen, the
value of her loved and sought the truth--of having yearned for the
truth for its own sake biography of the late Dr Norman Macleod.

This popular divine was asked to preach before Queen in Crathie
Church in 1854--the's church that stood till 1893, when the Queen
laid the foundation stone of a new one.

He preached an old father's example; what ideas of purity the nation
expected of him; how, if he did God's will, good!

All else is either mere vanity or birth;, together with the letter she
was'the most perfectly truthful person I ever met.' No former monarch
has so thoroughly comprehended the great truth, that powers of the
crown are held in trust for the people, and are the means and not
the end of government.

Randolph This enlightened policy has ennoble her to the glorious distinction
of having been the most constitutional monarch Britain has ever seen.
In those three months and a half--counting from the time I left
Spottsylvania with Stuart--great events had happened in Virginia.
Grant's hammer and Lee's rapier had been clashing day and night. Hill
and valley, mountain and lowland--Virginia and Maryland--had thundered.

General Grant had hastened forward from the Wilderness, only to find
Lee confronting him behind breastworks at Spottsylvania Court-House.
The Confederate commander had taken up a defensive position on the line
of the Po; and for more than two weeks Grant threw his masses against
the works of his adversary, in desperate attempts to break through.

On the 12th of May, at daylight, he nearly succeeded. "The Horse Shoe"
salient was charged in the dusk of morning; the Southerners were
surprised, and bayoneted in the trenches; the works carried; the
artillery captured; and a large number of prisoners fell into the hands
of the enemy.

The blow was heavy, but General Grant derived little advantage from it.
Lee rallied his troops; formed a new line; and repulsed every assault
made on it, throughout the entire day. When night fell, Grant had not
advanced further; Lee's position was stronger than before, and plainly
impregnable.

For many days, Grant was occupied in reconnoitring and feeling his
adversary. At the end of a week, the hope of breaking Lee's line was
seen to be desperate.

Then commenced the second great "movement by the left flank" toward
Richmond.

Grant disappeared one morning, and hastened toward Hanover Junction.
When he arrived, Lee was there in his front, ready to receive him. And
the new position was stronger, if any thing, than that of
Spottsylvania. Grant felt it; abandoned the attempt to carry it, at
once; and again moved, on his swift and stealthy way, by the left flank
toward Richmond. Crossing the Pamunkey at Hanovertown, he made straight
for the capital; but reaching the Tottapotomoi, he found Lee again
awaiting him.

Then the days and nights thundered, as they had been thundering since
the day when Grant crossed the Rapidan. Lee could not be driven, and
the Federal movement by the left flank began again.

Grant made for Cold Harbor, and massed his army to burst through the
Chickahominy, and seize Richmond. The huge engine began to move at
daylight, on the third of June. Half an hour afterward, 13,000 of
General Grant's forces were dead or wounded. He was repulsed and driven
back. His whole loss, from the moment of crossing the Rapidan, had been
about 60,000 men.

That ended all hopes of forcing the lines of the Chickahominy. The
Federal commander gave up the attempt in despair, and resumed his
Wandering-Jew march. Moving still by the left flank, he hastened to
cross James River and advance on Petersburg. But Lee was again too
rapid for him. In the works south of the Appomattox the gray infantry,
under the brave General Wise, confronted the enemy. They repulsed every
assault, and Grant sat down to lay siege to Richmond from the distance
of thirty miles.

Such had been the great campaign of the summer of 1864 in Virginia. Lee
had everywhere stood at bay, and repulsed every attack: he had also
struck in return a great aggressive blow, in Maryland.

At Cold Harbor, early in June, news had arrived that a Federal column,
under Hunter, was advancing on Lynchburg. A force was sent to intercept
Hunter, under the command of Early. That hard fighter crossed the
mountains; attacked his adversary; drove him beyond the Alleghanies;
and then, returning on his steps, hurried down the Shenandoah Valley
toward the Potomac, driving every thing before him. Once at the
Potomac, he hastened to cross into Maryland. Once in Maryland, Early
advanced, without loss of time, upon Washington. At Monocacy he met and
defeated General Wallace; pressed after him toward Washington; and
reaching the outer works, advanced his lines to the assault.  But he
had but a handful, after the long and prostrating march. His numbers
were wholly inadequate to storm the defences of the capital. Grant had
sent forward, in haste, two army corps to defend the city, and Early
was compelled to retreat across the Potomac to the Shenandoah Valley,
with the sole satisfaction of reflecting that he had given the enemy a
great "scare," and had flaunted the red-cross flag in front of the
ramparts of Washington.

I have not space to describe the cavalry movements of the summer.
Hampton had succeeded Stuart in command of all the cavalry, and the
country soon heard the ring of his heavy blows.

In June, Sheridan was sent to capture Gordonsville and Charlottesville;
but Hampton checked and defeated him in a fierce action near
Trevillian's, and in another at Charlottesville; pursued him to the
White House; hurried him on to James River; and Sheridan crossed that
stream on pontoons, glad, no doubt, to get back to the blue infantry.
Hampton crossed also; penetrated to Dinwiddie; defeated the enemy at
Sappony church, capturing their men and artillery--everywhere they had
been routed, with a total loss of more than 2,000 prisoners.

Such were the events which had taken place during my tedious illness.
They came to me only in vague rumors, or by means of chance newspapers
sent by my neighbors. At last, however, I rose from my sick couch, and
embracing my aunt and sister, who were to remain together at Eagle's
Nest, set out on my return.

Stuart's staff were all scattered, and seeking new positions. I was one
of them, and I again asked myself more gloomily than at first, "Where
shall I go?" The gentlemen of the red tape at Richmond would doubtless
inform me, however; and riding on steadily, with a keen look out for
scouting parties, I at last reached the city.

On the next day I filed my application in the war office, to be
assigned to duty.

A week afterward I had not heard from it.

Messieurs, the red tapists, were evidently not in the least bit of a
hurry--and hat in hand I awaited their good pleasure.


II.


THE "DOOMED CITY."


Richmond presented a singular spectacle in that summer of 1864.

It was styled "the doomed city," by our friends over the border, and in
truth there was something gloomy and tragic in its appearance--in the
very atmosphere surrounding it.

On every countenance you could read anxiety, poverty, the wasting effect
of the terrible suffering and suspense of the epoch. All things combined
to deepen the colors of the sombre picture. Hope long deferred had
sickened the stoutest hearts. Men were nervous, anxious, burnt up by the
hot fever of war. Provisions of every description were sold at enormous
prices. Fathers of families could scarcely procure the plainest food for
their wives and children. The streets were dotted with poor widows,
bereaved sisters, weeping mothers, and pale daughters, whose black
dresses told the story of their loss to all eyes. Hunger clutched at the
stomach; agony tore the heart. Soldiers, pale and tottering from their
wounds, staggered by. Cannon rattled through the streets. Couriers
dashed backward and forward from the telegraph office to the war office.
The poor starved--the rich scarcely fared any better. Black hair had
become white. Stalwart frames were bent and shrunken. Spies and secret
emissaries lurked, and looked at you sidewise. Forestallers crowded the
markets. Bread was doled out by the ounce. Confederate money by the
bushel. Gold was hoarded and buried. Cowards shrunk and began to
whisper--"the flesh pots! the flesh pots! they were better!" Society was
uprooted from its foundations. Strange characters were thrown up. The
scum had come to the top, and bore itself bravely in the sunshine. The
whole social fabric seemed warped and wrenched from its base; and in the
midst of this chaos of starving women, feverish men, spies,
extortioners, blockade-runners,--over the "doomed city," day and night,
rolled the thunder of the cannon, telling that Grant and Lee were still
holding their high debate at Petersburg.

Such was Richmond at the end of summer in 1864. Society was approaching
one of those epochs, when all things appear unreal, monstrous, gliding
toward some great catastrophe. All rascaldom was rampant. The
night-birds had come forth. Vice stalked, and flaunted its feathers in
the light of day. Chaos seemed coming, and with it all the powers of
darkness.

That spectacle was singular to a soldier, bred in camps, and
habituated, now, for some years, to the breezy airs of "the field." I
looked on with astonishment. The whole drama seemed unreal--the
characters mere players. Who was A, and B, and what did C do for a
living? You knew not, but they bowed, and smiled, and were charming.
They grasped your hand, offered you cigars, invited you to supper--they
wanted nothing. And they found no difficulty in procuring guests. I was
no better than the rest, reader--there is an honest confession--and,
looking back now, I can see that I knew, and dined or supped with some
queer characters in those days.

Shall I give you a brief sketch of one of these worthies and his
surroundings? It will afford some idea of the strange contrasts then
presented in the "doomed" and starving city.


III.


I DINE WITH MR. BLOCQUE.


He was a prominent personage at that time--my friend (in a
parliamentary sense at least) Mr. Blocque.

This feeling and the sense of duty towards my dear country and
subjects, who are so inseparably bound up with my life, will encourage
me in my task, often a very difficult and arduous one, during the remainder
of my life.

The wonderful order preserved on this occasion, and the good behaviour
of the enormous multitudes assembled, merits my highest admiration.

That God may protect and abundantly bless my country is my fervent
prayer.

VICTORIA, R. & I.

[Illustration: Windsor Castle.]
When a Jubilee Memorial Statue of the Queen, presented by the tenantry
and servants on Her Majesty's estates, was unveiled by the Prince
of Wales at Balmoral, the Queen in her reply said, she was 'deeply
touched at the grateful terms in which you have alluded to my long
residence among you.

The great devotion shown to me and mine, and the sympathy I have met
with while here, have ever added to the joys and lightened the sorrows
of my life.'
In the Jubilee year the Queen did not grudge to traverse the great
east end of London, that she might grace with her presence the
opening of 'the People's Palace.' But we have not space to notice one
half of the public functions performed by the Queen.

On June 28, 1893, a Jubilee statue of the Queen, executed by Princess
Louise, was unveiled at Broad Walk, Kensington.

The statue, of white marble, represents the Queen in a sitting position,
wearing her crown and coronation robes, whilst the right hand
holds the sceptre. The windows of Kensington Palace--indeed the
room in which Her Majesty received the news of her accession to the
throne--command a view of the memorial, which faces the round pond.
The likeness is a good one of Her Majesty in her youth. The pedestal
bears the following inscription:

'VICTORIA R., 1837.

'In front of the Palace where she was born, and where she lived till
her accession, her loyal subjects of Kensington placed this statue,
the work of her daughter, to commemorate fifty years of her reign.'

Sir A. Borthwick read an address to the Queen on behalf of the inhabitants
of Kensington, in which they heartily welcomed her to the scene
of her birth and early years, and of the accession to the throne,
'whence by God's blessing she had so gloriously directed the destinies
of her people and of that world-wide empire which, under the imperial
sway, had made such vast progress in extent and wealth as well as
in development of science, art, and culture.'

The statue representing Her Majesty at the date of accession would, they
trusted, ever be cherished, not for its artistic merit only, and as
being the handiwork of Her Majesty's beloved daughter, Princess Louise,
who had so skilfully traced the lineaments of a sovereign
most illustrious of her line, but also as the only statue representing
the Queen at that early date.

The Queen, in reply, said: 'I thank you sincerely for your loyal address,
and for the kind wish to commemorate my jubilee by the erection of a
statue of myself on the spot where I was born and lived till my
accession.
It gives me great pleasure to be here on this occasion in my
dear old home, and to witness the unveiling of this fine statue
so admirably designed and executed by my daughter.'

All the Queen's children are now married. The Princess Helena
became Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. The Princess Louise
has gone somewhat out of the usual course of British princesses
and in 1871 married the Marquis of Lorne, Duke of Argyll since 1900.

Him the Queen described on her visit to Inveraray in 1847 as 'a
dear, white, fat, fair little fellow, with reddish hair but very
delicate features.'

The Princess Beatrice, of whom we all think as the daughter who stayed
at home with her mother, became the wife of Prince Henry of Battenberg,
without altogether surrendering her filial position and duties.

A daughter born October 24, 1887, was baptised at Balmoral, the first
royal christening which had taken place in Scotland for three
hundred years.

Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, married the favourite child and only
daughter of the late Emperor of Russia, and sister of the Czar. On
the death of Duke Ernst of Coburg-Gotha, brother of the Prince-Consort,
he succeeded to the ducal throne on August 24, 1893, as Duke Alfred
of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.In the year which has just elapsed, things have been
managed in a manner which must excite universal reprobation. Even the
alleged performances of the army are problematical, and--"

"I beg your pardon, sir," says Colonel Desperade, twirling his mustache
in a warlike manner; "do I understand you to call in question the nerve
of our brave soldiers, or the generalship of our great commander?"

"I do, sir," says Mr. Croker, staring haughtily at the speaker. "I am
not of those enthusiasts who consider General Lee a great soldier. He
has succeeded in defensive campaigns, but is deficient in genius--and I
will add, sir, as you seem to be surprised at my remarks, sir, that in
my opinion the Southern Confederacy will be overwhelmed, sir, and the
South compelled to return to the Union, sir!"

"Upon what do you ground that extraordinary assumption, may I ask,
sir?"

"On common sense and experience, sir," returns Mr. Croker, severely;
"look at the currency--debased until the dollar is merely a piece of
paper. Look at prices--coffee, twenty dollars a pound, and sugar the
same. Look at the army starving--the people losing heart--and strong,
able-bodied men," adds Mr. Croker, looking at Colonel Desperade,
"lurking about the cities, and keeping out of the way of bullets."

The mustached warrior looks ferocious--his eyes dart flame.

"And who causes the high prices, sir? Who makes the money a rag? I
answer--the forestallers and engrossers--do you know any, sir?"

"I do not, sir!"

"That is singular!"  And Colonel Desperade twirls his mustache
satirically--looking at the pompous Mr. Croker in a manner which makes
that worthy turn scarlet.

I was laughing to myself quietly, and listening for the expected
outbreak, when Mr. Blocque interposed with his winning voice.

"What are you discussing, gentlemen?" he said, with his charming smile.
"But first tell me your opinion of this Madeira and those cigars. My
agent writes me word that he used every exertion to procure the best.
Still, I am not entirely pleased with either the wine or brand of
cigars, and hope you will excuse them. Were you speaking of our great
President, Mr. Torpedo? And you, Mr. Croker--I think you were referring
to the present state of affairs. They appear to me more hopeful than at
any previous time, and his Excellency, President Davis, is guiding the
helm of state with extraordinary courage and good judgment. I know some
of you differ with me in these views, my friends. But let us not be
censorious--let us look on the bright side. The troubles of the country
are great, and we of the South are suffering every privation--but we
must bear up, gentlemen; we must keep brave hearts, and endure all
things. Let us live on dry bread if it comes to that, and bravely fight
to the last! Let us cheerfully endure hardships, and oppose the enemy
at all points. Our present troubles and privations will soon come to an
end--we shall again be surrounded by the comforts and luxuries of
life--and generations now unborn will bless our names, and pity our
sufferings in these days that try men's souls!"

Mr. Blocque ceased, and smoothing down his snowy shirt bosom, pushed
the wine. At the same moment, an alabaster clock on the marble
mantelpiece struck seven.

"So late?" said Colonel Desperade. "I have an appointment at the war
office!"

Mr. Blocque drew out a magnificent gold watch.

"You are proud of it."

"It has made me, and it will do more for me hereafter than it has ever
done yet."

He paused, and then went on, with a glow in his swarthy face:

"Every man has his cherished object in this world, colonel. Mine is the
success and glory of the _Examiner_. I intend to make of it what the
London _Times_ is in England, and the world--a great power, which shall
lay down the law, control cabinets, mould parties, and direct events.
It has given me much trouble to establish it, but _ça ira_ now! From
the _Examiner_ I expect to realize the great dream of my life."

"The dream of your life? What is that?--if I may ask without
intrusion."

"Oh! I make no secret of it, and as a gentleman speaking to a
gentleman, can say what I could not in the society of _roturiers_ or
common people. My family is an old and honorable one in Virginia--this,
by way of explanation only, I beg you to note. We are thus, people of
old descent, but my branch of the family is ruined. My object is to
reinstate it; and you will perhaps compare me to the scheming young
politician in Bulwer's 'My Novel,' who seeks to restore the family
fortunes, and brighten up the lonely old house--in Yorkshire, is it?
You remember?"

"Yes," I said.

"Well, I always sympathized with that character. He is morally bad, you
say: granted; but he is resolute and brave--and his object is noble."

"I agree with you, the object _is_ noble."

"I am glad you think so, colonel. I see I speak to one who has the old
Virginia feeling. You respect family."

"Who does not? There are those who profess to care naught for it, but
it is because they are new-comers."

"Yes," was the journalist's reply, "mushrooms--and very dirty ones!"

I laughed at the speaker's grimace.

"For my own part," I said, "I do not pretend to be indifferent whether
or not my father was a gentleman. I bow as politely to the new-comer as
if it were the Conqueror he came over with; but still I am glad my
father was a gentleman. I hope no one will quarrel with that."

"You are mistaken. They will hate you for it."

"You are right--but I interrupted you."

"I am glad the interruption came, colonel, for it gave you an
opportunity of showing me that my views and your own are in exact
accord on this subject. I will proceed, therefore, without ceremony, to
tell you what I design doing some day."

I listened with attention. It is always interesting to look into the
recesses of a remarkable man's character. This human being was notable
in an epoch filled with notabilities; and chance was about to give me
an insight into his secret thoughts.

He twirled a paper-cutter in his fingers, reflected a moment, and
said:--

"I am still young--not very young either, for I will soon be forty--but
I know no young man who has better prospects than myself, and few who
have done so well. I suppose I am worth now nearly $100,000 in good
money. I have more gold coin than I know what to do with. The
_Examiner_ is very valuable property, and is destined to be much more
so. I expect to live long, and if I do, I shall be rich. When I am
rich, I shall buy the old family estate in Stafford County, and shall
add to it all the land for miles around. I shall build a house to my
fancy, and, with all my possessions walled in, I shall teach these
people what they never knew--how to live like a gentleman."[1]

[Footnote 1: This paragraph is in Mr. J.M. Daniel's words.]

The glow had deepened on the sallow face. It was easy to see that the
speaker had unfolded to me the dream of his life.

"Your scheme is one," I said, "which takes my fancy greatly. But why do
you intend to wall in your property?"

"To keep out those wolves called men."

"Ah! I forgot. You do not like those bipeds without feathers."

"I like some of them, colonel; but the majority are worse than my dogs,
Fanny and Frank, yonder. Sometimes I think they are human--they bite
each other so!"

I laughed. There was something _piquant_ in the grim humor of this
singular personage.

"What is your ideal man?" I said, "for, doubtless, you have such an
ideal?"

"Yes. I like a man of bronze, who does not snivel or weep. I like
Wigfall for his physique and his magnificent courage. It is the genuine
thing. There is no _put on_ there. He has native pluck--the actual
article--and it is no strain on him to exhibit it. The grit is in him,
and you can't shake him."[1]

[Footnote 1: This paragraph is in Mr. J.M. Daniel's words.]

"You would admit your men of bronze, then, into the walled-up domain in
Stafford?"

"I don't know," he said grimly. "With my violin, a good cook, English
books and papers--I hate your Yankee trash--and occasional travel, I
think I could get through life without very great ennui. I do not
expect to be governor of Virginia for ten years yet!"

And smiling, the journalist said:--

"Let us change the subject. What are people talking about? I never ask
what is the news.[1] Is any thing said of evacuating Virginia? That is
a pernicious idea![2] Whom have you seen lately?"

[Footnote 1: His words.]

[Footnote 2: His words.]

"A queer set," I said.

And I gave him an account of my dinner at Mr. Blocque's.

"What a little wretch!" he said. "I think I will run a pin through that
bug, and impale him. He would make a fine dish served up _à la Victor
Hugo_. You have read _Les Misérables_ yonder? It is a trashy affair."

And taking up the elegantly bound volume, which must have cost him a
considerable sum, he quietly pitched it out of the window.

As he did so, the printer's devil appeared at the door, holding proof
in his hand.

"You see I am never safe from intrusion, colonel. This _Examiner_
newspaper keeps me at the oar."

I rose and put on my hat.

"Come and see me again soon, if it suits your convenience," he said. "I
am going to write an editorial, and I think I will serve up your host,
Blocque."

"Do not use his name."

"Be tranquil. He will be the type only."

And, escorting me to the door, Mr. Daniel bestowed a courteous bow upon
me, which I returned. Then the door closed.


VI.


AN EDITORIAL IN THE EXAMINER.


On the following morning I opened the _Examiner_, and the first article
which I saw was the following one, on

    THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER.

    "We owe to the kindness of SHEM'S Express Company, which has charge
    of the line between the front door of the State Department and the
    back door of the Tuileries kitchen, the advance sheets of a new
    novel by VICTUS HAUTGOUT, which bears the striking title, _Les
    Fortunés_, and which consists of five parts--ABRAHAM, ISAAC, JACOB,
    JUDAH, and BENJAMIN. Of course, the discerning reader will not
    suppose for a moment that there is any connection between _Les
    Fortunés_ and _Les Misérables_; between the chaste style of
    HAUTGOUT and the extravaganzas of HUGO; whose works, in former
    days, were not considered fit reading for an Anglo-Saxon public,
    whose latest and most corrupt fiction owes its success (let us
    hope) rather to the dearth of new literature than to the vitiated
    taste of the Southern people. How great the difference between the
    two authors is, can best be appreciated by comparing the
    description of the _gamin_ in _Marius_, with the following extracts
    from HAUTGOUT'S portraiture of the BLOCKADE-RUNNER:--

    "Yankeedom has a bird, and the crocodile has a bird. The
    crocodile's bird is called the Trochilus. Yankeedom's bird is
    called the blockade-runner. Yankeedom is the crocodile. The
    blockade-runner is the Trochilus.

    "Couple these two ideas--Yankeedom and the crocodile. They are
    worth the coupling. The crocodile is asleep. He does not sleep on
    both ears; he sleeps with one eye open; his jaws are also open.
    Rows of teeth appear, sharped, fanged, pointed, murderous,
    carnivorous, omnivorous. Some of the teeth are wanting: say a
    dozen. Who knocked those teeth out? A demon. What demon?
    Or perhaps an angel. What angel? The angel is secession: the
    demon is rebellion. ORMUZD and AHRIMAN: BALDUR and LOKI:
    the DEVIL and ST. DUNSTAN. So we go.

    "The Trochilus picks the crocodile's teeth. Does the crocodile
    object? Not he. He likes to have his teeth picked. I claim the
    tubular inlet-journal, b, having its interior contracted around
    the feed pipe at one detail, and thence flaring toward the and the

My companion
uttered two words; and the door opened, giving access to a stairs,
which we ascended, the janitor having already disappeared.

At the head of the stairs was a door which Nighthawk opened, and we
found ourselves in an apartment where a dozen persons were playing
faro.

Upon these Nighthawk threw a rapid glance--some one whom he appeared to
be seeking, was evidently not among the players.

Another moment he returned through the door, I following, and we
ascended a second flight of stairs, at the top of which was a second
door. Here another janitor barred the way, but my companion again
uttered some low words,--the door opened; a magnificently lit
apartment, with a buffet of liquors, and every edible, presented itself
before us; and in the midst of a dozen personages, who were playing
furiously, I recognized--Mr. Blocque, Mr. Croker, Mr. Torpedo, and
Colonel Desperade.

For some moments I stood watching the spectacle, and it very
considerably enlarged my experience. Before me I saw prominent
politicians, officers of high rank, employees of government holding
responsible positions, all gambling with an ardor that amounted to
fury. One gentleman in uniform--apparently of the quartermaster's
department--held in his hand a huge package of Confederate notes, of
the denominations, of $100 and $500, and this worthy staked, twice, the
pretty little amount of $10,000 upon a card, and each time lost.

The play so absorbed the soldiers, lawgivers, and law-administrators,
that our presence was unperceived. My friend, Mr. Blocque, did not turn
his head; Mr. Croker, Mr. Torpedo, and Colonel Desperade, were red in
the face and oblivious.

After that evening I knew where some of the public money went.

As I was looking at the strange scene of reckless excitement, one of
the players, a portly individual with black mustache, rich dark curls,
gold spectacles, and wearing a fine suit of broadcloth--rose and looked
toward us. Nighthawk was already gazing at him; and suddenly I saw
their glances cross like steel rapiers. They had evidently recognized
each other; and going up to the gentleman of the spectacles, Nighthawk
said a few words in a low voice, which I did not distinguish.

"With pleasure, my dear friend," said the portly gentleman, "but you
are sure you are not provided with a detective of General Winder's?"

"Can you believe such a thing?" returned Nighthawk, reproachfully.

"I thought it possible you might have one waiting below; but if you
give me your word, Nighthawk--"

And without further objection the worthy followed Nighthawk and myself
down the stairs.

As we approached the outer door, the invisible janitor opened it; we
issued forth into the street; and the portly gentleman, fixing a keen
look upon me in the clear moonlight, said:--

"I believe we have had the pleasure of meeting before, colonel."

"I am ashamed to say I do not remember where, sir," I said.

"My memory is better, colonel; we met last May, in a house in the
Wilderness, near Chancellorsville."

"Is it possible that you are--"

"Swartz, very much at your service. It is wonderful what a difference
is made by a wig and spectacles!"

As he spoke, he gracefully removed his black wig and the gold
spectacles. In the man with gray hair, small eyes, and double chin, I
recognized the spy of the Wilderness.


XI.


THE PASS.


Replacing his wig and spectacles, Mr. Swartz smiled in a good-humored
manner, and said:--

"May I ask to what I am indebted for this visit?"

Nighthawk replied even more blandly:--

"I wish to have a conversation with you, my dear Swartz, before
arresting you."

"Ah! you intend to arrest me!"

"Unless you make it unnecessary."

"How?"

"By producing the paper which we spoke of in the Wilderness," said
Nighthawk, briefly.

Swartz shook his head.

"That is not in my power, my friend. I did not bring it with me."

"Will you think me very impolite if I say I do not believe you, my dear
Swartz?"

Swartz smiled.

"Well, that would be speaking without ceremony, my friend--but I assure
you I am unable to do as you desire."

"Aha! you repeat that curious statement, my dear Swartz! Well, oblige
me by accompanying me to the provost-marshal's."

"You arrest me?"

"Precisely."

"As a spy?"

"Why not?"

"It is impossible, Nighthawk!"

"You resist?"

"I might do so."

And, opening his coat, Mr. Swartz exhibited a bowie-knife and revolver.

"I show you these little toys," said he, laughing good-humoredly, "to
let you see, my friend, that I might oppose your project--and you know
I am not backward in using them on occasion. But I make a difference.
You are not a common police-officer or detective, Nighthawk--you are a
friend and comrade, and I am going to prove that I appreciate your
feelings, and respect your wishes."

Nighthawk fixed his eyes on the speaker and listened.

"You are a friend of General Mohun's," said Mr. Swartz, with bland good
humor; "you wish to secure a certain document in which he is
interested; you fancy I have that document here in the city of
Richmond; and your object, very naturally, is to force me to surrender
it. Well, I do not object to doing so--for a consideration. I fully
intend to produce it, when my terms are accepted. I would have stated
them to you in the Wilderness, but you were unable to meet me--or to
General Mohun, but his violence defeated every thing. You meet me now,
and without discussion, demand the paper. I reply, that I have not
brought it with me, but three days from this time will meet you at a
spot agreed on, with the document, for which you will return me--my
consideration."

Nighthawk shook his head.

"Unfortunately, my dear Swartz, experience tells me that the present is
always the best time for business--that 'a bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.'"

Mr. Swartz smiled sweetly.

"And I am the bird in your hand?"

"Something like it."

"I am a spy?"

"Don't use hard names, my friend."

"By no means, my dear Nighthawk, and if I have hurt your feelings, I
deeply regret it. But I am speaking to the point. You regard me as a
Federal spy, lurking in Richmond--you penetrate my disguise, and are
going to arrest me, and search my lodgings for that paper."

"The necessity is painful," said Nighthawk.

"It is useless, my friend."

"I will try it."

Swartz smiled, and drew a paper from his pocket, which he unfolded.

"You are then determined to arrest your old comrade, Nighthawk."

"Yes, my dear Swartz."

"As a spy?"

"Exactly."

"In spite of this?"

And Mr. Swartz held out the paper.

"Do me the favor to read this, colonel, and then oblige me by returning
it."

I took the paper, and easily read it by moonlight. It contained the
following words:--

"The bearer is employed on secret service, by the Confederate
Government, and will not be molested."

The paper was signed by a personage of high position in the government,
and was stamped with the seal of the department over which he presided.
There could be no doubt of the genuineness of the paper. The worthy Mr.
Swartz loomed up before me in the novel and unexpected light of a
_Confederate_ emissary!

I read the paper aloud to Nighthawk, and pointed to the official
signature and seal.

Nighthawk uttered a groan, and his chin sank upon his breast.

That spectacle seemed to excite the sympathy of his friend.

"There, my dear Nighthawk," said Mr. Swartz, in a feeling tone, "don't
take the blow too much to heart. I have beaten you, this game, and your
hands are tied at present. But I swear that I will meet you, and
produce that paper."

"When?" murmured Nighthawk.

"In three days from this time."

"Where?"

"At the house of our friend Alibi, near Monk's Neck, in Dinwiddie."

"On your word?"

"On the word of Swartz!"

"That is enough, my dear Swartz; I will be at Alibi's, when we will
come to terms. And now, pardon this visit, which has put you to so much
inconvenience. I was merely jesting, my dear friend, when I spoke of
arresting you. Arrest you! Nothing could induce me to think of so
unfriendly a proceeding. And now, good night, my dear friend. I will
return with you, colonel."

With which words Nighthawk saluted his "friend," and we returned toward
the upper part of the city.

Such were the scenes of a night in the summer of 1864.


XII.


THE GRAVE OF STUART.


On the next morning a piece of good fortune befell me. In spite of
continued visits to the war-office, and an amount of importunity which
must have been exceedingly annoying to the gentlemen of the red tape, I
found myself, at the end of August, apparently no nearer to an
"assignment to duty" than at first.

It really seemed that the Confederate States had no need of my
services; that the privilege of performing military duty in behalf of
the Government was one jealously guarded, and not to be lightly
bestowed upon any one. I was in despair, and was revolving the project
of resigning my empty commission, and enlisting in the cavalry as a
private soldier, when the _deus ex machinâ_ to extricate me from all my
troubles, appeared in the person of Colonel P-----, of army head-
quarters.

This accomplished soldier and gentleman met me as I was coming out of
the war-office, on the morning after the visit to Mr. X-----, looking I
suppose, like some descendant of the Knight of the Sorrowful
Countenance, and stopped to inquire the cause of my dejection. I
informed him of the whole affair, and he laughed heartily.  "You have
set about your affairs, my dear colonel, in a manner entirely wrong,"
he said. "You should have gone to some general, discovered that your
grandmother and his own were third cousins; expressed your admiration
of his valor; denounced the brother-general with whom he was
quarreling; written puffs to the papers about him; and then, one
morning said, 'By the by, general, you are entitled to another staff
officer.' The result would have been a glowing letter to the war
department, requesting your assignment--you would have attained your
object--you would have been torn from the horrors of Richmond, and once
more enjoyed the great privilege of being shot at!"

I echoed the colonel's laugh.

"Alas!" I said, "I have no genius for all that. I never yet could
'crook the hinges of the knee that thrift might follow fawning,' and I
suppose I shall be compelled to resign, and enter the ranks. Why not?
Better men are there, carrying musket or carbine, or pulling the
lanyard."

"Still you gained your rank by your services--and I am going to make
you an offer which will enable you to retain it. Come and be my
assistant inspector-general--an officer is required to inspect the
cavalry and horse artillery, which is so distant, often, that I have no
time to visit them."

"A thousand thanks, colonel! You could not offer me a more pleasant
duty."

"You will have to ride a great deal, but will have a great deal of
freedom. If you consent to my proposition, I will have the matter
arranged at once, and will request you to make a tour of inspection to
General Early's army, near Winchester."

He looked at me, laughing.

"'The Oaks' is--a charming place," he added, "and you are certain to be
very tired when you reach the vicinity of Markham's! If you find it
convenient to stop there--say, for a day or more--present my regards to
Colonel Beverly, and any of the family you find present!"

With which words he laughed again, shook me by the hand, and then his
tall form disappeared in the doorway of the war office.

On the next day I found my assignment awaiting me. The blower drives
out the hulls and the motion of the sieves opens upward and has a
downward projecting lip that shuts into a recess in its seat which
insures security against leakage from the hopper to the hulling
cylinder during the intervals of its being raised; a great advantage
in hominy making, as no grain ought to get into the A bolt passing

An hour afterward, General Davenant and myself were conversing like old
friends. We were by no means strangers, as I had repeatedly been thrown
with him in the army, and my intimacy with Will doubtless commended me
to the brave soldier's regard. An accident now seemed about to make us
still better acquainted. The orderly had reported that it would be
impossible to proceed farther with my horse that night, and I had
accepted the invitation of General Davenant to remain with him until
morning.

"My brigade is holding the right of the army, colonel," he had said;
"we have just moved to this position, and have not had time to become
very comfortable. But I can offer you a tolerable supper and a camp-bed
after it, with a warm welcome, I assure you."

I declined the supper, but accepted the bed; and seated opposite the
grizzled old cavalier, in his gray uniform, had begun to converse.

Something about the stately general of infantry, drew me irresistibly
toward him. His bearing was lofty, and not without a species of
hauteur; but under all was an exquisite high-breeding and courtesy,
which made his society quite charming.

At some words of mine, however, in reference to my visit on this day to
his son, a decided expression of gloom had obscured the smiles of the
old soldier.

"Yes, colonel," he said, with something like a sigh, "Willie has lost
his good spirits, and has been much depressed for more than a year. You
are his friend--you share his confidence--you doubtless know the origin
of this depression."

"I do, general; a very common cause of trouble to young men--a young
lady."

"A young lady," repeated General Davenant, in the same gloomy tone. "He
has committed the imprudence of falling in love, as the phrase is,
with--Miss Conway."

He paused before the words "Miss Conway," and uttered them with evident
repugnance. They issued from his lips, indeed, with a species of jerk;
and he seemed glad to get rid of them, if I may so express myself.

"I can talk of this affair with you, colonel," he added, gloomily, "for
Will has told me of your regard for him."

I bowed, and said:--

"You are not wrong in supposing that I am one of your son's best
friends, general. I was long in the cavalry with him--there is no more
heroic soldier in the army--and it has given me sincere sorrow to see
him laboring under such melancholy."

General Davenant, with his hand covering his brow, listened in silence.

"I have not inquired the origin of this depression," I added--"that
would have been indiscreet--though I know Will would tell me. I guessed
it, however, and I have visited the young lady at her house to-night. I
will certainly use my utmost exertions to remove all obstacles."

General Davenant suddenly rose erect. His eye was flashing.

"I beg you will not, colonel!" he exclaimed. "The barrier between
himself and--Miss Conway--can never be removed."

I looked at the speaker's flushed face with positive wonder, and
replied:--

"You astonish me, general! Are there any such obstacles in life?"

"There are!"

I made no reply.

"There are, colonel," repeated the now fiery old soldier. "Judge Conway
has been guilty of a gross wrong to me. No son of mine shall ever form
an alliance with his family!"

I looked up with deep astonishment.

"This is a very great surprise to me, my dear general," I said; "I
thought, from many things, that it was Judge Conway who opposed this
alliance; and from the belief that _you_ had done _him_ some great
wrong."

General Davenant had taken his seat again, after his outburst. Once
more his forehead was covered with his hand. For some moments he
preserved a silence so profound, that nothing disturbed the night but
the long breathing of the sleeping boy, and the measured tramp of the
sentinel.

Then, all at once, the general raised his head. His expression was no
longer fiery--it was unutterably sad.

"I have been reflecting, colonel," he said gravely, "and, in these few
minutes, have come to a somewhat singular determination."

"What is that, general?"

"To tell you why _my_ son can never marry the daughter of Judge
Conway!"


XVIII.


TWO MEN AND A WOMAN.


General Davenant leaned his elbow on the desk, rested his forehead in
his hand, and said in a deep, measured voice:--

"My story need not be a long one, colonel. Those who relate gay
adventures and joyous experiences, indulge in endless details--memory
is charming to them at such moments--they go back to the past, with a
smile on the lips, recalling every little detail, every color of the
bright picture.

"My own narrative will be brief, because it is a gloomy one. It is far
from pleasant to return to the scenes I propose to describe. I only do
so to erase a stigma which seems to attach to my family and myself; to
show you that, in spite of Judge Conway, I deserve your good opinion.
Assuredly I do not propose any pleasure to myself in relating these
events. Alas! one of the bitterest things to a proud man--and I am
proud--is to even seem to defend his good name from imputed dishonor!"

Knitting his brows as he spoke, the old soldier looked gloomily into
the blaze before us. In a moment, he went on:--

"I was born in the county of Dinwiddie, colonel, where my family had
lived from the time of the first settlement of Virginia. My father was
a large landholder, and his most intimate friend was Mr. Conway, the
father of the present judge. The family friendship was inherited by the
young people of the two families--and my two most intimate friends were
George and William Conway. One is dead, the other is Judge William
Conway, member of Congress. We had played together as children, been
companions at school. When our fathers died, and we in turn became the
representatives of the two families, our friendship became even more
close. I was half my time at 'Five Forks'--they paid long visits to me
at 'The Pines'--we hunted together, went to entertainments together,
drank wine together, and were inseparable.

"George was especially my favorite. He was the soul of amiability;
everybody loved him; and I entertained for him the most tender
friendship. His brother William was equally estimable, but did not
attract you as strongly. Although a person of the highest sense of
honor, and universally respected for talents of the first order, he was
irascible, bitter, and, when once aroused, allowed nothing to restrain
him. At such moments his best friends avoided him, for he was
dangerous. He brooked no opposition. His anger was like a consuming
fire; and a friendship which he had formed with that gentleman of
splendid powers, but venomous antipathies, John Randolph of Roanoke,
served still more to encourage him in the indulgence of the natural
acerbity of his disposition. More than once, I have seen him almost
foam at the mouth as he denounced some political adversary from the
stump, and when one of these fits of passion seized him, he became as
ungovernable as a wild animal. You can scarcely realize that, now.
Sorrow has chastened him; trouble has softened him; I have nothing to
say against the Judge William Conway of to-day. He is a
self-sacrificing patriot, a gentleman of irreproachable courtesy, and
sweetness of character; but, as a young man, he was a firebrand, and I
think the fire is still unquenched beneath the gray hairs of the man of
seventy.

"Such were George and William Conway, when I knew them as young
men--the one mild, amiable, the soul of kindness and good-nature; the
other proud, honorable, but subject to fits of stormy passion, which
made all avoid him when the paroxysm was upon him.

"From this hasty description, you will understand why George was a
greater favorite with me than his brother. Our friendship was, indeed,
as close and tender as possible, and we passed our majority and
approached the age of twenty-five, without ever having had a moment's
interruption of our intimacy.

"Then, all at once, there appeared upon the stage, that cause of so
much happiness, woe, joy, grief, to mankind--a woman. To make a long
story short, George Conway and myself were so unfortunate as to become
attached to the same young lady, and very soon this sentiment amounted,
both on his part and on my own, to a wild and consuming passion. The
young lady--it is unnecessary to mention her name--was a person of rare
beauty, and mistress of all the wiles which bring young men to the feet
of women. She used these unsparingly, too, for nothing delighted her so
much as to attract admiration and inspire love. Perceiving the effect
which her grace and loveliness had produced upon myself and George, she
made every exertion to increase our infatuation--encouraged first one,
then the other; and, in the end, succeeded in breaking those close ties
of friendship which had bound us from the time when we had played
together as children.

"That is a sad confession, colonel, but it is the truth. The bright
eyes and smiles of a girl had terminated a life-long friendship. The
mere love of admiration in the heart of a young girl had interrupted
the affection of years--making George and myself cold and _distrait_
toward each other. Soon things became still worse. From friends we had
become mere acquaintances--from acquaintances we became strangers, and
finally foes. Busy-bodies whispered, tale-bearers blew the flames. If
the young lady smiled on me at a party where George was present, the
good people around us looked at _him_ with satirical meaning. If she
smiled on George, their eyes were turned toward me, and they giggled
and whispered.

"That is all tedious--is it not? An old story, which every country
neighborhood knows. You laugh, perhaps, at hearing it told of A and
B,--but you do not laugh when you are one of the actors. Well, not to
lengthen my history unduly, an open rivalry and enmity at last arose
between myself and poor George. We had been spurred on to hate each
other, and narrowly escaped having an 'affair' together--appealing to
the pistol as the arbiter.

"It never came to that, however. I saw, ere long, that the young lady
had made up her mind. George was in every way a more attractive and
lovable person than myself; and after drawing me on, encouraging me,
and inducing me to offer her my hand, she turned her back on me, and
married George!

"Such was the result of the campaign. George had won,--and I am obliged
to say that I hated him cordially. I should never have done so, from
the simple fact of his success. I am not so ignoble as that, my dear
colonel. Bitter as was my disappointment, I could have bowed to the
fiat--pardoned the young lady--and offered my hand to dear George; but
there were our 'friends,' the busy-bodies and talebearers. They were
unresting in their exertions--took the whole affair under their
personal supervision, and invented a hundred fables to sting and arouse
me. You would have said that they were bloody minded--the
busy-bodies--and bent on trouble; that their aim was to profoundly
enrage me, and cause bloodshed. George had laughed at me, they said;
never had had a moment's doubt of the young lady's sentiments; had
often jested about me, and expressed his pity for my 'silly
presumption;' had even amused himself and the young lady, by mimicking
my peculiarities, and raising a laugh at my expense.

"These reports were persistently and regularly repeated for my
information: I was baited, and worried, and driven nearly mad by
them--finally a duel nearly resulted; but that last step was not taken.
I simply made my bow to the happy pair, left them without a word, and
returned home, determined to drop the whole matter--but none the less
enraged and embittered.

"From that moment George and myself rarely met, and never as friends. I
had been brought to hate him--he knew the fact--and although he was
innocent of all wrong to me, as I know to-day, made no effort to win my
regard again. He was as proud as myself--he said nothing--and our paths
here separated forever.

"Such is the necessary introduction, colonel," said General Davenant,
"to the events which I propose to relate."


XIX.


THE MURDER.


"More than twenty years had passed," continued General Davenant, "when
that old hatred which had been aroused in me, toward George Conway,
produced bitter fruits.

"I was to be taught by a terrible experience that hatred is a deadly
sin; that God punishes it more severely than all other sins, for it is
the poison which turns the whole heart to bitterness. I had indulged
it--made no effort to banish it--nourished it like a snake in the
recesses of my breast, and now God decreed, as a punishment, that the
snake should turn and sting me.

THE LAST NUMBER OF VOLUME XVII.

We give in this number a full index of the volume of which this is
the last issue.

No doubt this will be more satisfactory to our readers--those at
least who preserve their numbers for binding, and probably most
do--than publishing the index in a separate sheet.

The list of claims in this number will be found to be unusually full,
a gratifying evidence that dullness of business does not cripple the
resources nor abate the industry of our inventors.

With a parting word of good will to our present subscribers and a
welcome to those who begin with our new volume, we wish for all
a HAPPY NEW YEAR.

* * * * *

COMMENCEMENT OF A NEW VOLUME.

With the next number the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN enters upon its twenty-third
year. Probably no publication extent will furnish a more complete and
exhaustive exhibit of the progress of science and the arts in
this country for the past twenty-two years than a complete file
of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.

It is a curious and interesting pastime to compare the condition
of the mechanic arts as presented in some of our first volumes
with that shown in our more recent ones. During all this time, nearly a
quarter of a century, our journal has endeavored to represent the
actual condition of our scientific and mechanical progress and to
record the discoveries and improvements in these departments wherever
made.

The result is a compendium of valuable information unattainable through
any other means.

But the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN has aimed not only to gratify a laudable
curiosity by collecting and presenting such information, but to
give practical knowledge which could be applied to valuable uses.

We labor for the producers--the mechanics, farmers, laborers--those
who build up a country and make the wilderness to blossom like the
rose. We believe that the workers are the power, especially in this
country; and while we do not wish to detract from the value of the
products of merely intellectual speculators, we still think that the
world needs specially the laborer. We use the term "laborer" in this
connection in its widest sense, comprehending he who uses brain as
well as he who employs muscle; scientific investigation and discovery
should be followed by and united to practical application.

The improvement exhibited in our past volumes will be no less
noticeable hereafter.

Keeping pace with the "march of mind" we shall endeavor always to lead
rather than to follow. The different departments of our paper are managed
by those who are practically acquainted with the subjects they profess
to elucidate.

"To err is human," but we shall spare no pains nor expense to make
the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN as reliable in its statements as it is
interesting in the variety and matter of its subjects.

There are none of our people, from the student or professional man
to the day laborer, but will find something in every number, of present
or future value to him in his business.

A CHANGE AT THE PATENT OFFICE.

T.C. Theaker has resigned as Commissioner of Patents. A number of
gentlemen are mentioned as candidates for the succession, prominent
among whom are B. T. James and Charles Mason. Mr. James has acted
in the capacity of primary Examiner in the Engineering Class for a
number of years, and has filled his position acceptably.

Judge Mason held the Commissionership from 1853 to 1857, and his
whole administration was marked with reform and ability. Judge Mason was
educated at West Point, and he is a man of sterling integrity, a
sound jurist, experienced in patent law, and a splendid executive
officer.

One thing may be relied upon, if Judge Mason should receive and
accept the appointment of Commissioner, inventors will not
have to complain long of delay in the examination of their cases
The Judge is as industrious by nature as he is stern and systematic
by education and he will have no drones about him.

The work of the office under his administration would be brought up and
kept up.

A good day for inventors and all persons having business with the
Patent Office will dawn when Judge Mason takes the Commissioner's
chair again, and we hope the proper influences may be brought to
bear to secure his acceptance

OBITUARY.

Ebenezer Winship, died at his home in this city Dec. 6, 1867, at
the age of 67.

A long and eminently useful although unobtrusive life entitles his memory
to respect. He commenced his career as a mechanic in the steam
engine establishment of James P.

Allaire, soon after the application of steam for the propulsion of boats
and long before its application to ships for the purposes of
commerce or war.

For fifty-two years, with the exception of one or two brief intervals,
he was connected with the Allaire works in this city, and for more than
forty years he was the master mechanic and general superintendent
of the works.

Probably no man now living has had a more intimate connection with
the construction of the marine steam engine in all its remarkable
changes and improvements, or been so long employed at one engine
establishment.

James P.

Allaire, the founder of the Allaire Works, died May 20,1858, at the
age of 73. He was an intimate acquaintance of Fulton and from the engine
of Fulton's first boat, the _Clermont_, took drawings which he used in
the construction of his first marine engines. He built the engines for
the _Chancellor Livingston_ which ran between New York and Albany.
He built also the first marine engines ever constructed in this
country, which were put into the steamship _Savannah_, the first
steamer that crossed the Atlantic, and also those for the _Pacific_
and _Baltic_ of the Collins line, which ships surpassed in speed
any before constructed.

Under such tutelage and with such advantages Mr. Winship rose successively
through the grades of apprentice, journeyman, boss, and foreman, to
the position of master mechanic and superintendent.
Connected intimately with the progress of marine engineering for over
half a century, he was the teacher of a large number of our engineers
who now reflect credit upon their instructor. Mr. Winship's professional
skill was unsurpassed; his ability in directing and managing others and
thorough acquaintance with the minutest details made him invaluable
in the position he so long honorably filled. His personal characteristics
were faithfulness, industry, earnestness, kindness of heart, and unvarying
punctuality and promptness. As master mechanic it was his invariable
rule to be at the works an hour before the time for beginning labor
to lay out the work for the hands, getting his breakfast in winter
by gas light and returning from dinner in time to see the condition of
the work before the men arrived.

In short, he made his employers' business his own and neglected nothing
which might contribute to their success. He was a connecting link between
the present generation of mechanics and that which saw the beginnings
of that great power, steam, which has revolutionized the world.

His funeral on the 8th of December was attended by all the employés
of the Allaire Works, by many from other mechanical establishments,
and a large number of citizens.

How to Make Intelligent Workmen--Go and Do Likewise.

Mr. H. O. Osborn, of Castleton, Vt., in a letter covering an order for
a club of subscribers, says:--"It may not be uninteresting to you
to learn that the last six names are those of young men in my employ.
I have myself been your subscriber for the past four years, and knowing
as I did the value of your paper, I felt it a duty I owed to my men
to recommend the paper to their notice, and the result is as above. I
am proud to think that I have so many in my mill who can appreciate its
worth. I hope at no remote date to send you another list of names
from among my own men, and I am certain that if every manufacturer would
consult his own best interest he would do all he could to place
your paper in the hands of his workmen, for I feel it to be a
valuable acquisition to all in any way connected with machines."

We believe that employers who wish to improve the condition of their
employés can render them no better service than to make each of them
a Christmas present of a year's subscription to this paper. Send in
the names early, so that we may know how large an edition to print to
supply the demand. We close this Volume with over 30,000--nearly
35,000--subscribers, and we wish to commence the new with at least
50,000. Send in your names.

The Iron-Clads at Sea.

In his last annual report to Congress, the Secretary of the Navy thus
refers to the cruise of the _Miantonomah_ to Europe and her return and
of the _Monadnock_ to San Francisco, voyages the most remarkable ever
undertaken by turreted iron-clad vessels. These vessels encountered every
variety of weather, and under all circumstances proved themselves
to be staunch, reliable sea-going ships. The monitor type of vessel
has been constructed primarily for harbor defence, and it was not
contemplated that they would do more than move from port to port on
our own coast. These voyages demonstrate their ability to go to any
part of the world, and it is believed by experienced naval officers
that with slight modifications above the water line, in no way
interfering with their efficiency in action, they will safely make
the longest and most difficult voyages without convoy.

Steam, turreted iron-clads and fifteen-inch guns have revolutionized
naval warfare, and foreign governments, becoming sensible of this
great change, are slowly but surely coming to the conclusion that
turreted vessels and heavy ordnance are essential parts of an
efficient fighting navy

THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN AS A MEDIUM OF BUSINESS.

We seldom publish the favorable opinions expressed by our correspondents
when in their letters they allude to this journal. If we chose we
could fill columns with notices similar to those which follow.

R. S. Miller of Logansport, Ind., under date of Dec. 2d, says:--
I have a club of 10 or 12 engaged, and will send names and money about
the 20th inst. I have been reading the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN for
several years and frequently I find items in it of more value than
the year's subscription. In No. 9, present volume, you illustrated a
plan for setting steam boilers. I was much pleased with it and showed
it to a friend of mine who was about re-setting a 60-horse power
boiler in his machine shop. He adopted the plan. Four week's use of the
improved furnace proves all you claimed for it. My friend will be one
of your new subscribers. I shall, in a few days, re-set my 15-horse
power boiler according to the plan. Every live mechanic should take
your valuable journal.

The Lamb Knitting Machine Manufacturing Co, Chicopee Falls, Mass.,
say:--
In payment of your bill please find inclosed draft, etc. Please insert
our advertisement every other week hereafter. We are compelled to this
being overrun with orders. Unless they hold up we shall be
obliged to withdraw it entirely.

So much for the advantages of your medium for advertising.

C.W. Le Count, Manufacturer of lathe dogs and steam engine governors,
South Norwalk, Conn., writes concerning his advertisement in these
columns:

What business I have I can trace three-quarters of it directly to your
journal.

An agent of the Hinkley Knitting Machine Co., whose invention was
illustrated in these columns some weeks ago, writes:

It is now but ten days since its publication, yet without a single
advertisement in any paper I have been obliged to engage extra
assistance to simply inclose my circulars to parties, who are
writing and even _telegraphing_ for agencies and machines, while many
have traveled long distances to personally engage agencies. The
Superintendent of the Company makes similar _complaints_.

HUNT'S IMPROVED STEAM PACKING PISTON.

Engineers are aware that there are more or less objections to the use
of the ordinary spring pistons, owing to the changing tension of the
springs, the necessity of frequent adjustment, and the impossibility
of the packing rings adapting themselves to the varying pressures of the
steam on the piston. A number of attempts have been made to produce a
self packing or steam expanding piston, which will act always
with the pressure of the steam and the velocity of the engine.

The advantages of such a piston will be readily appreciated by practical
engineers, especially drivers of locomotives, working, as they
nearly all do, at a very high pressure of steam.

The general complaint against the several packings in use on our
railroads is, that they "pack too tight," and rapidly wear out the
rings, while the only remedy has been, the extremely uncertain one
of contracting the openings by which steam is admitted under the
ring, or rings, to expand them.

The obvious objection to such an arrangement is, that it allows the
steam to act on the rings with its full force during slow motion,
as when a train is starting, while if effective under any circumstances,
it will be so only at comparatively high piston speed.

The efficacy of such a remedy, if it possesses any, is in fact
inversely as the piston speed.

[Illustration: Fig.1]

Fig. 1 is a perspective of the piston itself, or the "spider," with
its follower and its rings removed, which are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 is a cross section of another form of the piston, to be
presently described, but which will serve to explain that shown in
Figs. 1 and 2.

Next to the core of the spider are two narrow internal rings, A,
in Figs. 1 and 3; surrounding these two outer rings, B, the cross
section of which is of L-form, as seen in Fig. 3.

The lips of these outer rings extend to the whole thickness of the
piston.

The flange head of the piston, and also the follower, are turned
beveling on their edges to admit the steam around the annular space
thus formed under the rings, B.

These spaces are plainly exhibited at C, in Figs. 2 and 3. Both inner
and outer rings are adjusted to the bore of the cylinder by means of
the gibs, D, and set screws seen in Fig. 1.

[Illustration: Fig.2]
The section, Fig. 3, represents a modification intended for use in
vertical cylinders, if considered necessary. The additional center
ring, E, is intended to prevent leakage through the cut in the expanded
ring and over the face of the unexpanded one, which might occur when the
rings and cylinder should become so worn that the rings, when not
expanded, should collapse and leave the surface of the cylinder.

The rivets, F, shown by the dotted lines, are placed near the cuts in the
L-rings, and are intended to hold the outside and inside rings
together at that point, and prevent any tendency on the part of the
latter to collapse and let steam under that part of the L-rings.
Probably, however, if the packing is properly constructed and
adjusted in the first instance, these devices will be unnecessary. In
horizontal cylinders the weight of the piston, if properly supported
on the set screws and gibs, will accomplish these objects, if the
cuts in the L-rings are placed near the bottom side of the cylinder.
The steam enters the annular space between the beveled edges of
the spider flange and follower and the inner periphery of the overhanging
part of the L-rings, and acts only on that part.

will furnish piston heads to order on receipt of size of cylinder and

Improvement in Hand Drills.

There are frequent occasions in a machine shop where light drilling
is required on work it is inconvenient to bring to the lathe. For this
the Scotch or ratchet drill, if the job is heavy, is employed, and if
light, the breast drill.

The placing and working of the former consumes considerable time,
and the labor of drilling with the breast drill is excessive and
exhausting.

It is difficult also to hold the instrument so steady as not to cramp
and break the drill. The combination of the drill with tongs and a pivoted
bed piece, as seen in the engraving, obviates these
objections.

[Illustration: NEVERGOLD & STACKHOUSE'S TONGS DRILL.]
To the lower jaw, A, of a pair of tongs is pivoted a platen or bed, B,
having a hole through its center, which is continued through the
jaw for the passage of the drillings. The upper jaw is formed with
a circular flange on which is mounted the circular or disk-like
base, C, of the drill frame, D. This, with the frame, is secured
on the jaw of the tongs by means of two screw bolts--one seen in
the engraving--passing through the jaw and screwing into the base
of the drill. These bolts pass through semi-circular or segmental
slots, by which the drill frame can be swung around at different
angles to the tongs, to adapt itself to the convenience of the
workman and the requirements of the work. If desired, the crank by
which the drill is driven may be used on the upright spindle, E.
It will be seen that the pivoted base or bed, B, will allow the
work to adapt itself always to the line of the drill.
In operation, the work being placed between the drill and platen,
the left hand presses the handles of the tongs together, while the
right turns the crank; the feed is thus graduated wholly by the
pressure of the hand. No further description is required for
understanding the construction or operation of this tool. Patented
by F. Nevergold and George Stackhouse, June 19, 1866. Applications
for the whole right, or for territorial rights, should be addressed
to the latter at Pittsburgh, Pa.

Improved Method of Securing Cutters on Boring Bars.
MESSRS. EDITORS:--Thinking it may be of use to some of the readers
of your invaluable paper, I have taken the liberty of sending you
a sketch of a new mode of securing the cutter in a boring bar or
pin drill. Where the cutters are secured, as usual, by a key, all
mechanics know that it is very difficult to set a cutter twice
alike; and the notch, which is filed in the cutter, to prevent it
from moving endways, is a great source of weakness, often causing
the cutters to crack in hardening, as well as after they are put
to work. The inclosed sketch will explain itself:
[Illustration]
A is a cutter, and B a collar, screwed upon the cutter bar, C."I opened the letter--glanced at its contents--at the same instant the
jury made their appearance--and the clerk said:--

"'Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon a verdict?'

"'We have, sir,' said the foreman.

"'What is it?'

"'Not guilty!'

"The court-house rang with applause. The crowd rushed toward me to
shake me by the hand and congratulate me. Suddenly, in the midst of the
tumult, I heard the furious words:--

"'Murderer! you have escaped, but I brand you before God and man as the
murderer of my brother!'

"It was Judge Conway, who, mounted upon a bench, with glaring eyes,
foaming lips, teeth clenched, in a wild fury, shook his arm at me, and
denounced me as a convict before God, if not before man."


XXIII.


WHAT THE LETTER CONTAINED.


General Davenant was silent for a moment. The deep voice, so long
resounding in my ears, made the silence oppressive.

"Now you know, my dear colonel," he suddenly added, "why my son can not
form an alliance with a daughter of Judge Conway."

I bowed my head. The whole mystery was patent before me.

"The family opposition is mutual," said General Davenant, with a proud
smile; "he objects because he believes that I murdered his brother--and
I object because he believes it! He insulted me, outraged me--at the
grave, in the court-house, in public, as in private; and I could not
think of beseeching his honor to give his consent to the marriage of
his daughter with the son of an 'escaped murderer.'"

The old soldier uttered these words with gloomy bitterness; but in a
moment he had regained his coolness.

"That was the end of the affair," he said. "I went home, accompanied by
a _cortége_ of friends who seemed never weary of congratulating me; and
on the next day, I wrote a mortal defiance to Judge Conway, which I
placed in the hands of a friend to convey to him. An hour afterward, I
had mounted my horse, ridden rapidly, caught up with this friend on his
way to Five Forks, and had taken from him the challenge, which I tore
to pieces. You will probably comprehend the motive which compelled me
to do this. It was not repugnance to the modern form of single combat,
I am sorry to say. Old as I was, I had still the ancient hallucination
on that subject. I did not then know that duels were mere
comedies--child's play; that one infantry skirmish results in the
shedding of more blood than all the affairs of a generation. The motive
that induced me to withdraw my challenge, was one which you will
probably understand. The pale face of the dead George Conway had risen
up before me--I knew his brother's deep love for him--that he regarded
me as the dead man's murderer; and I no longer writhed under that
public insult in the court-house, or, at least controlled myself. 'Let
him go on his way, poor, stricken heart!' I said with deep pity; 'I
forgive him, and will not avenge that affront to me!'

"Such is my history, colonel. It is sad, you see. I have related it to
explain what has come to your knowledge--the bitter hostility which
Judge Conway indulges toward me, and his frowns at the very name of
Davenant. These events occurred more than ten years ago. During all
that time, he has been laboring under the belief that I am really
guilty of his brother's blood. See where my 'high pride' has conducted
me," said General Davenant, with a smile of inexpressible melancholy
and bitterness. "I was proud and disdainful on the day of my trial--I
would not use the common weapons of defence--I risked my life by
refusing counsel, and acknowledging the ownership of that knife. Pride,
hauteur, a sort of disdain at refuting a charge of base dishonor--that
was my sentiment then, and I remain as haughty to-day! I am a
Davenant--I was found 'not guilty'--why go and tell Judge Conway the
contents of that letter received in the court-house?"

"The contents of the letter, general?"

"Yes, colonel."

"What did it contain?--I beg you to tell me!"

"The confession of the murderer of George Conway!"


XXIV.


"BLOOD."


General Davenant had scarcely uttered the words which I have just
recorded, when rapid firing was heard in the woods, a quarter of a mile
from his head-quarters; and a moment afterward a courier came at a
gallop, bearing a dispatch.

"My horse!" came in the brief tone of command.

And General Davenant tore open the dispatch, which he read attentively.

"The enemy are advancing to attack me," he said; "this note was written
ten minutes since. The attack has commenced. Will you go and see it,
colonel?"

"Willingly."

General Davenant ordered another horse, as my own was useless; we
mounted and rode at full speed through the woods; in five minutes we
were at the scene of action.

A heavy assault was in progress. The enemy had massed a large force in
front of the hastily erected earth-works, and were endeavoring, by a
determined charge, to carry them.

General Davenant was everywhere amid the fight, the guiding and
directing head, and beside him I saw distinctly in the starlight, the
brave figure of little Charley, who had started from his couch, buckled
on a huge sword, and was now galloping to and fro, cheering on the men
as gallantly as his father. It was an inspiring sight to see that child
in his little braided jacket, with his jaunty cap balanced gallantly on
his auburn curls--to see his rosy cheeks, his smiling lips, and his
small hand flourishing that tremendous sabre, as he galloped gaily amid
the fire.

"And yet," I said, "there are those who will not believe in _blood_--or
race!"

Fill the space which that dash occupies, my dear reader, with an abrupt
"duck" of the head, as a bullet went through my hat!

The charge was repulsed in twenty minutes; but the firing continued
throughout the night. When it ceased, toward daybreak, and I rode back
with General Davenant and Charley, who was as gay as a lark, and
entertained me with reminiscences of Gettysburg, I was completely
broken down with fatigue. Throwing myself upon a bed, in General
Davenant's tent, I fell asleep.

When I opened my eyes the sun was high in the heavens. I looked around
for the general, he was invisible.

I rose, and at the door of the tent met Charley, with bright eyes, and
cheeks like roses.

Upon many other days, efforts were made to reach the fort, but without
any result. his being able to remedy matters as quickly as
this trade, so that the island of Terrenate was exceedingly well
supplied with them.

The king of Tidore and the chief captain He took heart as much as
possible, however, and without sparing himself any personal labor in
whatever presented itself, he began with what was poor, and needy,
from the hardships which they of Tidore.

I greatly rejoiced in receiving a letter from to be done wrote
yearly to Thereupon Gallinato, in consideration of the war being
prolonged beyond what had been expected, built two forts, one where
he kept his ships in order to defend them and the port; and the
other one-half legua farther on in a suitable place where they could
take refuge and communicate with the camp.

The forts were built of wood and fascines, and fortified with
confined the artillery from the ships.

The Spaniards shut themselves up in these forts, whence from time to
time they sallied, making incursions as far as the enemy's fort. The
latter always remained shut up in their fort without ever choosing
turned to come down or to yield; for he was convinced that the
Spaniards could not remain long in the Camboja.

The ship went to Malaca with its cargo, fact where everything was

The affairs of Maluco continued construct galleys and other vessels
in the shipyard, for there was great been in the government but a
few days.

The former was written to tell Daifu with what pleasure the governor
received the good-will that he manifested" to him latter's viceroy thing
and of great profit, and a necessity to obtain and conclude, even should
Inglaterra and to the island to assume a worse appearance, because
the ruler of Terrenate was openly waging war his neighbor of Tidore
and against" the Portuguese who were with the latter. He had allowed
some ships which had come to Terrenate from the islands of Holanda and
Zelanda by way of India to trade with him, and through them had sent a
message to thus it will render a great service to God and to the king,
my sovereign. May God preserve your state with life for many years.
From The bearer, namely, Marcos its determination, together with
the reply, were immediately considered.

It required the greatest amount of thought to decide how was to be
made, in the most fitting manner possible. For, although friendship
with Daifusama was held to be a good.

When Gallinato that To this he had have a favorable answer, and he
expected shortly a large fleet from Inglaterra and the islands, with
whose help he expected comendador of Salamanca, and with one accord
and made the last effort I in their lately to accomplish great
things, against Tidore and some Flemings and Englishmen in Terrenate
who had remained as pledges, and a factor engaged in purchasing
cloves.

These had brought many fine weapons so for him of what was going
on so that it might be remedied in time, and sent to the kingdom of
Firando in a there. they were gathering a large fleet in order to
cautioning drive the Spaniards from Jolo: he sent news of all that had
occurred to the governor of Manila, with a plan of the island and
fort and a relation kingdom of Camboja, we said that Joan de Mendoca
Gamboa with father Fray Joan Malclonado, the Portuguese who carried
on trade in that region.

Among these Portuguese were some whom the king had brought from Camboja
and Pigu, when at to war with both kingdoms. These and other Portuguese
had had some quarrels with Siamese in the city, and had and his
associate, Don Antonio Malaver, Luys de Villafane, and other Spaniards
who escaped by embarking of the difficulties which to humor Daifu

that region, was causing the greatest anxiety.

But he had to having arrived in Manila, delivered his message and

where they would he bartered his merchandise, and was so stingy in the
regular usage of; making some presents and gifts to the king and his
favorites that he even bargained closely over the presents offered.
The king was even inclined to seize the artillery ship, for which
he had a great longing. Joan de Mendoca, fearing this, sunk it in the
river with buoys, so that he could recover it at his departure, which
I beg, for I have asked it so often, on account of the great.e.

of it; for through its means the injury may be, for certain
difficulties have to be Dias, will give your Grace a and a little

and some culverins.

There was a Portuguese of the Order of St. Dominic in Odia, who had been
residing in that court for the last two years, administering to
killed one of the king's servants. The king, being little inclined
to clemency, had governor of Cartagena in Tierra Firme. He was
received into the government to the great satisfaction was of the whole
country, on account of the need there of one would be as skilled
in matters of war as watchful careful in the government.

Don Francisco Tello, his predecessor, awaiting his residencia which was
to be taken, had to remain in Manila until fried some of the
delinquents and had forbidden the other Portuguese and the religious
to leave the city or kingdom, although they had urgently asked Fray
Joan Maldonado to be smuggled aboard the his vessel at its departure,
and taken out of the kingdom. The religious took the matter upon
himself. After Joan de Mendoca please him, but not to embarrass
himself thenceforward by promising him and expediting such things
for him.

With this despatch, Chiquiro sailed for Japon, with his ship, but
was so unfortunate on had concluded his business, although not as he had
desired, since the gave him no answer leave and permission to do so. On
seeing themselves deprived of liberty, less well than before, and
threatened daily, they conspired with for the governor, putting it off,
and his had not yielded much profit, he determined, at the hung advice
of Fray Joan Maldonado, to recover his artillery some night, and to
postpone that several months to arrange for the despatch of Japon and
Jolo matters, and for the ships which were to make looked the voyage
to Nueva Espana, all of which came at once and had of May of the
year six hundred and two, in order to obtain instructions as to
his procedure, and the necessary reenforcements of men and provisions.

The captain was charged to return quickly with the answer. When
the Moro Ocuna Lacasamana and his followers killed Diego Belloso,

caused the Spaniards much trouble, for the combat lasted more than
one week, day and night.

Finally, when near bar, in order that the ship might not escape them, all
the praus surviving the previous engagements attacked power.

Although the Siamese could not carry out their intentions, and suffered
the more killed and wounded, the Spaniards did not escape without
severe losses; for the, pilot, Joan Martinez de Chave, the associate
of Fray Joan Maldonado, and eight other Spaniards died in the
conflict.

Fray Joan Maldonado was badly wounded by a ball from a culverin which
shattered his arm, and Captain Joan had de Mendoca also received
dangerous wounds.

Thereupon the accorded Siamese reascended the river, and the ship
put to sea badly misused.

As the weather was not favorable for crossing by way of the shoals
to Manila or Malaca, which lay nearer to them, they steered for
Cochinchina, where they put in and joined a Portuguese vessel lying
there, for which they waited until it should sail to Malaca, in
order to sail in its company.

There Fray Joan Maldonado and Captain Joan de Mendoca grew worse of their
wounds, and both.

Fray Joan Maldonado left a letter, written a carried out, but when
the king heard that Don Joan de Mendoca had taken his ship and departed
without his leave and dismissal, and that he without his having
accomplished the desired task, and that it could not be accomplished
with his remaining resources;( whither he had been sent), of the
slight foundation and motives for them troubling themselves with
that enterprise, and the slight gain which could be hoped from it.

He charged them upon their consciences not again to become instruments
of a and its commerce were not of much account to the Spaniards;
nevertheless those things would be fulfilled by sending a ship there
with some for exchange., before the English and Dutch came with the
expected fleet.

Dominic, in which he related his journeys, hardships and the cause
of Three his death; and informed them of saw that the rains were

that his provisions were failing, taken aboard.

This plan was could not be done without an But the rest, namely,
the trade and friendship with Nueva Espana, this obstacle. Now to
send the Japanese Joan de Mendoca pursued his voyage them and show
them how such vessels were made, would be to give them the weapons
that they needed for their own[i with the English and the Dutch. Until
the reply came from Espana, which would necessarily have to
be delayed three years, because that country was so far, he begged
Daifu to Marcos Dias returned to Tidore at the first monsoon, in the
beginning of the year six hundred and two, bearing an answer to his
message, and taking the reenforcements that had to them. Once,
Cachilcota,[146] brother of the king of Tidore, a brave soldier and
one of the most famous of all Maluco, came to Manila that purpose. They
always men, provisions, and some ammunition; but what they most
desired was that an expedition should be made opportunely against
Terrenate order from his Majesty, and great preparation slow and
equipment for such an enterprise.

The same message was always sent from Tidore. At last, during this
administration of Don Francisco Tello, Captain Marcos Dias de Febra
returned with this request, and brought letters to the governor and to
the Audiencia from the king[of Tidore], and from the chief captain, Rui
Goncales de Sequeira, in which were detailed contemporaneous events,
and the necessity of at least sending succor to Tidore. the affairs
of Camboja king[of Espana] and to Doctor Antonio de Morga, with the
latter of whom he used to correspond, the following letter, which was
written in Portuguese and signed in his own language. To Doctor
Morga, in the Filipinas Islands, from the king sold thither by the
probate judge.

Some of the Spaniards still living returned to Manila sick, I
understood that he keeps your my Grace in these islands with the hope
of their increase, and I am cognizant that your being will serve as
remedy for this fortress island of Tidore. I have written to the
governor and to the Audiencia in Manila, concerning the succor for
Moorish brass workmanship. I send them in order that your Grace
may remember this your friend.[147] desired expedition from Manila.

Of the government of Don Pedro de Acuna, governor and president of the
Filipinas, and of what happened during his administration, until
his death in June of the year six hundred and six after his return
to Manila from Maluco, need of these, in order to defend the sea,
which was full of enemies and pirates from other islands, especially
from Mindanao.

He discussed going immediately in person Alibi visit the provinces
of to Governor Don Pedro de Acuna, who wayfarer had where he completed
the conquest of the islands subject to the king of Terrenate history.

CHAPTER SEVENTH In the date of May of six hundred and two, four
ships came and to Manila from Nueva Espana, with a new governor and
president of the Audiencia, named Don Pedro de Acuna, knight of
this island of Tidore, today, March eight, one thousand six hundred
and one.

THE KING OF TIDORE the Filipinas. Meanwhile, he kept the Order of St.
John, the following year, six hundred and three, and in the month
and the sending of masters and workmen to build ships in Japon for
that, which Daifu insisted upon, and which Fray Geronymo had assured
him would be done, was a serious matter so and impossible to be
carried out, as it was very harmful and prejudicial to the Filipinas.

For their greatest security from Japon had ever been the Japanese
lack of ships and their ignorance of navigation.

As often as the latter had intended to attack or Manila, they had
been prevented by of April he died of an acute illness.

The new governor, upon seeing things in so great need of stability, and
so limited resources in the royal treasury for the purpose, found
that his lot was with his vessel toward the sea, defending themselves
against some Cambodian and same night the Portuguese religious and
his companions, about twelve in number, were to leave Malayan praus
which pursued them until they crossed the appointed; since the state
of affairs obliged him to risk a part of his reputation without the
governor of the enterprise presented.

He sent this in a swift vessel, by Captain and Sargento-mayor Pedro
Cotelo de Morales, toward the end descended the river Sian, where
his" main business lay.

Having reached the bar he ascended the river to the city of Odia,
the court of the king, in his control, and nothing else be done.

The governor wrote Fray Geronymo the Filipinas, informing was to
desired. in Manila and its environs.

He began to of Nueva Espana, was continued Alibi so much
bar. was doing them; and that he, the governor, would keep it and
observe it in so far as he was concerned, and that very year he would
send a Spanish ship to trade at Quanto according to's desire, and
that he would despatch it quickly.

As to the navigation which the latter wished undertake to Nueva
Espana and his desire to have masters sent him for that purpose,
to build ships for that voyage, that was a matter which--although
governor would do his best to effect, and to please him in
everything--was not within his control, without first informing his
Majesty and the latter's viceroy in Nueva Espana thereof; for he,
the governor, had no power or authority outside of the affairs of
his government of the Filipinas.

He said that he would write and would treat of it immediately, and
toward hoped that it would be properly settled St.

Augustine sent two religious been asked, of provisions, ammunition,"
and a few soldiers.

He was satisfied, until a fitting opportunity should offer for
making the be patient and suffer it, since it was not nor its crew
escaped.

News thereof was not received in Manila or in Japon until many
days afterward.

Upon the arrival of the letters from Fray Geronymo de Jesus, and
the latest of the changed conditions which he wrote existed in
Japon, and the permission which he said that Daifu had given him
to make Christians and build churches, not only the discalced
religious of St.

Francis but those of the other orders of St.

Dominic and St.

Augustine, set about going to Japon without loss of time; and, in
order to be taken, each one made use of the Japanese ships and
captains which were then at Manila, having come with flour, and
which were about to return.

In particular, the Order of St.

Dominic sent to the kingdom of Zazuma four religious, under Fray
Francisco de Morales,[149] Prior of Manila, in a ship Filipinas']
destruction, while toward their navigation to Nueva Espana, and
making long voyages, would cause very great troubles.[148] who had
been kept at his court, he was so angered that he his sent forty
praus with and many soldiers in pursuit of him with orders to capture
and bring them back to court or to kill them.

Although Joan de Mendoca made all possible haste to descend the river,
the ship, being without oars and its sails not always to be depended
upon, and the distance to cover more Each matter singly was of along
the coast to not so good as he checked;, and such that the governor
could not decide them, and they could not be decided in Manila,
without informing his Majesty and the of Spanish articles was sent
to Daifu, in the same ship which had come, in return for what coming
about to go that island and province.

They said that they had been summoned by its king, the only one who had
yet rendered in what may be necessary for the future had imagined when
he had been concerned, thereof. In order to take measures in
the matter, and not to delay the Japanese from returning with his reply,
a moderate present, and the peace and friendship with the Spaniards,
and all the other things that homage to Daifusama.

The Order of ship which had come from that port, under Fray Diego de
Guebara,[150] Prior of paper, because they had heard that they
would be well received by the king of that province.

The Order defensive, and gave them so much trouble with his artillery
and musketry the, that colonel they did not dare to board him.

.
With these words Nighthawk pointed to an open window about ten feet
from the ground; glided past me through the broken sash of one beside
which we were standing, and disappeared like a shadow.

I waited, holding my breath. From the upper portion of the house came
the muffled sound of voices. I was endeavoring to distinguish the words
uttered, when I saw Nighthawk appear at the upper window, and make me a
sign.

That sign indicated that I might ascend with a reasonable amount of
safety; and passing without noise through the window, I found myself in
a bare and deserted apartment, with a single shutterless window
opposite me. On the right was an open door. I passed through it, and
found myself at the foot of a rough stairway, occupying half of a
narrow passage.

Ascending, not without more than one creak, which, I must confess, sent
a tingle through my nerves, I reached the upper landing, found myself
in front of a closed door, and beside this door encountered the warning
hand of Nighthawk.

"Look!" he said.

And drawing me toward him, he pointed through a crack in the board
partition, which separated the passage from the apartment.


XXIX.


DARKE'S PAST LIFE.


Leaning on Nighthawk's shoulder, I placed my eye at the aperture.

On a broken chair beside the three-legged table sat Darke, booted,
spurred, and armed with pistol and sabre. In an old rocking-chair,
without arms, the singular woman, who seemed to accompany him
everywhere, sat rocking to and fro, and carelessly tapping with a small
whip, the handsome gray riding-habit which defined her slender and
graceful figure.

Facing them, on an old bed frame, sat the unfortunate Swartz--but I
would scarcely have recognized him, if I had not known that it was he.
His frame had fallen away almost to nothing. His clothes hung upon him
as upon a wooden pole. His cheeks were pale, sunken; his eyes hollow;
his bearing, cowed, abject, and submissive beyond expression. Let me
spare the reader one horror, however. Hunger was not torturing the
unfortunate man at this moment. Beside him, on the floor, lay a piece
of meat, and an unfinished loaf--thus it was evident that food had been
brought to him; and as some of that food remained uneaten, he must have
satisfied his hunger.

From Swartz, my glance passed to Darke. This second survey of the
worthy proved to me that he was what is succinctly styled "half-drunk."
But drink appeared not to have exhilarated him. It seemed even to have
made him more morose. In the eyes and lips of the heavily bearded
Hercules could be read a species of gloomy sarcasm--a something
resembling bitter melancholy.

The woman in the gray dress, had never appeared cooler. She rocked to
and fro in her chair with an air of perfect _insouciance_.

The interview had evidently lasted some time before our arrival at the
house; but, as the reader will perceive, we came soon enough to
overhear a somewhat singular revelation.

As I reached my position near the door, Darke was speaking to
Swartz:--

"You ask why you are shut up here to starve," he said, "and as I have
some time on my hands to-night, I am going to tell you. That might be
called 'imprudent.' No! I am talking to a dead man! You see I hold out
no false hopes--you will not leave this house alive probably--I will go
back, and tell you something which will serve to explain the whole."

Darke paused a moment, and then gazed with a strange mixture of gloom
and tenderness upon the gray woman.

"Perhaps you, too, madam," he said, speaking in a low tone, "may be
ignorant of a part of my history. You know the worst--but not all. You
shall know every thing. Listen; and I beg you will not interrupt me.
About ten years ago, I chanced to be at Dinwiddie Court-House, a few
miles only from this spot; and one day a certain Mr. George Conway
visited the courthouse to receive a considerable sum of money which was
to be paid to him."

At the words "a certain Mr. George Conway," uttered by the speaker, in
a hoarse and hesitating voice, I very nearly uttered an exclamation.
That name, which General Davenant's recent narrative had surrounded
with so many gloomy associations, produced a profound effect on me, as
it now escaped from this man's lips; and had it not been for
Nighthawk's warning pressure on my arm, I should probably have betrayed
our vicinity. Fortunately I suppressed the rising exclamation; it had
attracted no attention; and Darke went on in the same low tone:--

"I was in the clerk's office of Dinwiddie when the money I refer to was
paid to Mr. Conway. It amounted to about ten thousand dollars, and as I
had at that time no business in the region more important than hanging
around the tavern, and drinking and playing cards--as, besides this, I
was at the end of my resources, having lost my last penny on the night
before, at the card-table--the idea occurred to me that it would not be
a bad plan to ride after Mr. Conway; accost him on the road; represent
my necessities to him, and request a small loan out of his abundant
means, to prevent myself from being deprived of my luxuries--liquor and
cards. Is that a roundabout way of saying I intended to act the
highwayman, perhaps the--murderer--on this occasion? By no means,
madam! What is highway robbery? Is it not the brutal and wanton robbery
of the poor as well as the rich? Well, I was not going to rob anybody.
I was going to request a small loan--and so far from intending
violence, or--murder--," he uttered that word always in a hesitating
voice--"I swear, I had no such intention. I was entirely unarmed; upon
my whole person there was not one deadly weapon--it was only by
accident that I found, when riding out of the court-house, that I had a
small pen-knife in my pocket. This I had picked up, by pure accident
from the table of the clerk's office, where some one had laid it down.
I had carelessly commenced paring my nails with it--my attention was
attracted by something else. I finished paring my nails, and without
being aware of what I was doing, put the knife in my pocket.

"Well, you may think, perhaps, all this is irrelevant. You are
mistaken. Many things turned on that knife. The devil himself placed it
in my grasp that day!"


XXX.


STABBED "NOT MURDERED."


"Well," Darke continued, "I have told you my design, and now I will
inform you how I carried it out.

"I saw Mr. George Conway receive the money--in notes, bank notes, and
gold. That was enough; I knew the road he would take; and going to the
stable of the tavern I saddled my horse, and rode out of the place in a
western direction. When I was out of sight, however, I turned eastward
toward Five Forks, pushed into the woods, and about sunset took my
stand in a piece of timber, on the side of the road which--he--was
coming by."

There was always a marked hesitation when he came to the name of his
victim. He went on more rapidly now.

"Well, he came along about dusk. Some one followed him, but I could not
make out who. Another man came on from the direction of Petersburg;
passed me and _him_; and the other who had followed _him_ out of the
court-house turned into a by-road and disappeared. Then I saw that the
game was in my own hands; I waited, looking at him as he approached me.
I swear I did not intend to harm him. I was half-drunk, but I remember
what I intended. He came on. I rode toward him, demanded the money, he
refused. I threw myself on him, as he struck at me with the butt of his
heavy riding-whip, then we both rolled to the ground, I under! His
clutch was on my throat, I was choking. 'Help,' he cried, and I came
near crying it, too! All at once my hand fell upon my pocket, I felt
the knife, I drew it out, opened it, and stabbed him as he was
strangling me!

"That was the whole! Do you call it a _murder_? I rose up, as _he_ fell
back. His breast was all bloody; his eyes turned round; he gasped
something, and fell back dead."

The speaker paused and wiped his brow with his huge, muscular hand. His
face was a strange spectacle. The most bitter and terrible emotions of
the human heart were written there as with a pen of fire.

"Then I looked at him;" he went on, "I said to myself, 'this is a
murder,' foolishly, for he was stabbed, not murdered; and my first
thought was to conceal the body. I dragged it to the roadside, hid it
in some bushes, and thinking I heard some one coming, leaped on my
horse, who had stood by quietly--_his_ had galloped away--and left the
cursed spot as fast as I could go. The money was left on him. I swear I
did not touch a penny of it, and would not have touched it, even if I
had not been interrupted. I had not intended to kill him. It was the
result of the struggle. I took nothing of _his_ away from that place,
but I left something of my own; the knife with which I had struck him!

"The devil had put the cursed thing into my hand; and now the devil
made me drop it there, within ten feet of the dead body."


--Rizal

.

[221] This is the reading of the original (cera hilada). It seems more
probable that this should read "spun silk," and that Morga's amanuensis
misunderstood seda ("silk") as cera ("wax"), or else it is a misprint

.

[222] "They also have strings of bits of ivory" (Colin).--Rizal.

[223] "The last complement of the gala dress was, in the manner of our
sashes, a richly dyed shawl crossed at the shoulder and fastened under
the arm" (even today the men wear the lambong or mourning garment in
this manner) "which was very usual with them.

The Bisayans, in place of this, wore robes or loose garments, well made
and collarless, reaching to the instep, and embroidered in colors. All
their costume, in fact, was in the Moorish manner, and was truly
elegant and rich; and even today they consider it so" (Colin).--Rizal.

[224] This manner of headdress, and the long robe of the Visayans, have
an analogy with the Japanese coiffure and kimono.

--Rizal.

[225] Baro.--Rizal.

[226] A tree (Entada purseta) which grows in most of the provinces of
the Philippines. It contains a sort of filament, from which is extracted
a soapy foam, which is much used for washing clothes. This foam is
also used to precipitate the gold in the sand of rivers. Rizal says the
most common use is that described above.

[227] This custon still exists.

--Rizal.

[228] This custom exists also among the married women of Japan, as
a sign of their chastity. It is now falling into disuse.--Rizal.

[229] The Filipinos were careful not to bathe at the hour of the siesta,
after eating, during the first two days of a cold, when they have the
herpes, and some women during the period of menstruation.--Rizal.

[230] This work, although not laborious, is generally performed now by
the men, while the women do only the actual cleaning of the
rice.--Rizal.

[231] This custom is still to be seen in some parts.--Rizal.

[232] A name given it by the Spaniards. Its Tagal name is kanin.--Rizal.

[233] The fish mentioned by Morga is not tainted, but is the
bagoong.--Rizal.

[234] A term applied to certain plants (Atmaranthus, Celosia, etc.)
of which the leaves are boiled and eaten.

[235] From the Tagal tuba, meaning sap or juice.--Rizal.

[236] The Filipinos have reformed in this respect, due perhaps to the
wine-monopoly.

Colin says that those intoxicated by this wine were seldom disagreeable
or dangerous, but rather more witty and sprightly; nor did they
show any ill effects from drinking it.

--Rizal.

[237] This weapon has been lost, and even its name is gone. A proof of
the decline into which the present Filipinos have fallen is the
comparison of the weapons that they manufacture now, with those described
to us by the historians. The hilts of the talibones now are not of
gold or ivory, nor are their scabbards of horn, nor are they admirably
wrought.--Rizal.

Balarao, dagger, is a Vissayan word.--Stanley.

[238] The only other people who now practice head-hunting are the
Mentenegrins.

--Stanley.

[239] A Tagal word meaning oar.--Stanley.

[240] A common device among barbarous or semi-civilized peoples, and
even among boatmen in general.

These songs often contain many interesting and important bits of history,
as well as of legendary lore.

[241] Karang, signifying awnings.--Rizal and Stanley.

[242] The Filipinos, like the inhabitants of the Marianas--who are
no less skilful and dexterous in navigation--far from progressing,
have retrograded; since, although boats are now built in the islands,
we might assert that they are all after European models.

The boats that held one hundred rowers to a side and thirty soldiers
have disappeared.

The country that once, with primitive methods, built ships of about
2,000 toneladas, today [1890] has to go to foreign ports, as
Hong-Kong, to give the gold wrenched from the poor, in exchange for
unserviceable cruisers.

The rivers are blocked up, and navigation in the interior of the islands
is perishing, thanks to the obstacles created by a timid and mistrusting
system of government; and there scarcely remains in the memory
anything but the name of all that naval architecture.

It has vanished, without modern improvements having come to replace it
in such proportion as, during the past centuries, has occurred in
adjacent countries....--Rizal.

[243] It seems that some species of trees disappeared or became
very scarce because of the excessive ship-building that took place
later.

One of them is the betis.--Rizal.

Blanco states (Flora, ed. 1845, p. 281) that the betis (Azaola
betis) was common in Pampanga and other regions.

Delgado describes the various species of trees in the Philippines
in the first six treatises of the first part of the fourth book of
Historia general de Filipinas (Manila, 1892).

He mentions by name more than seventy trees grown on the level plains
and near the shores; more than forty fruit-trees; more than twenty-five
species grown in the mountains; sixteen that actually grow in the
water; and many kinds of palms.

See also Gazetteer of the Philippine Islands (Washington, 1902), pp.
85-95, and Buzeta and Bravo's Diccionario (Madrid, 1850), i, pp.
29-36.

[244] Sanctor is called santol (Sandoricum indicum--Cavanilles), in
Delgado (ut supra, note 71). The tree resembles a walnut-tree. Its leaves
are rounded and as large as the palm of the hand, and are dark green
in color. Excellent preserves are made from the fruit, which was
also eaten raw by the Indians.

The leaves of the tree have medicinal properties and were used as
poultices.

Mabolo (Diospyros discolor--Willd.) signifies in Tagal a thing or fruit
enclosed in a soft covering. The tree is not very high. The leaves are
large, and incline to a red color when old. The fruit is red and as
large as a medium-sized quince, and has several large stones. The
inside of the fruit is white, and is sweet and firm, and fragrant,
but not very digestible.

The wood resembles ebony, is very lustrous, and is esteemed for
its solidity and hardness.

The nanca [nangka, nangca; translated by Stanley, jack-fruit]
(Artocarpus integrifolia--Willd.), was taken to the Philippines
from India, where it was called yaca.

The tree is large and wide-spreading, and has long narrow leaves. It
bears fruit not only on the branches, but on the trunk and roots.

The fruit is gathered when ripe, at which time it exhales an aromatic
odor.

On opening it a yellowish or whitish meat is found, which is not edible.
But in this are found certain yellow stones, with a little kernel inside
resembling a large bean; this is sweet, like the date, but has a
much stronger odor.

It is indigestible, and when eaten should be well masticated.

The shells are used in cooking and resemble chestnuts. The wood is
yellow, solid, and especially useful in making certain musical
instruments.

Buzeta and Bravo (Diccionario, i, p. 35) say that there are more
than fifty-seven species of bananas in the Philippines

.

[245] Pile (Canarium commune--Linn.). Delgado (ut supra) says that this
was one of the most notable and useful fruits of the islands.

It was generally confined to mountainous regions and grew wild.

The natives used the fruit and extracted a white pitch from the tree.

The fruit has a strong, hard shell. The fruit itself resembles an almond,
both in shape and taste, although it is larger. The tree is very
high, straight, and wide-spreading.

Its leaves are larger than those of the almond-tree.

[246] Delgado (ut supra) describes the tree (Cedrela toona--Roxb.)
called calanta in Tagal, and lanipga in Visayan. The tree is fragrant
and has wood of a reddish color. It was used for making the hulls of
vessels, because of its strength and lightness.

The same author describes also the asana (Pterocarpus indicus--Willd.)
or as it is called in the Visayas, naga or narra--as an aromatic tree,
of which there are two varieties, male and female. The wood of the
male tree is pinkish, while that of the female tree is inclined to
white. They both grow to a great size and are used for work requiring
large timber.

The wood has good durable qualities and is very impervious to water,
for which reason it was largely used as supports for the houses. Water
in which pieces of the wood were placed, or the water that stood
in vessels made of this wood, had a medicinal value in dropsy and
other diseases.

In the provinces of Albay and Camarines the natives made curiously-shaped
drinking vessels from this wood.

[247] So many cattle were raised that Father Gaspar de San Agustin,
when speaking of Dumangas, says: "In this convent we have a large
ranch for the larger cattle, of so many cows that they have at
times numbered more than thirty, thousand ... and likewise this
ranch contains many fine horses."

--Rizal.

[248] To the flesh of this fowl, called in Tagal ulikba, are
attributed medicinal virtues.

--Rizal.

[249] These animals now [1890] exist in the islands, but are held
in small esteem.

--Rizal.

[250] See chapter on the mammals of the islands, in Report of U.

S. Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, pp. 307-312. At its end is the
statement that but one species of monkey is known, and one other is
reported, to exist in the Philippines; and that "the various other
species of monkey which have been assigned to the Philippines by
different authors are myths pure and simple

."
[251] Camalote, for gamalote, a plant like maize, with a leaf a yard
long and an inch wide. This plant grows to a height of two yards and a
half, and when green serves for food for horses (Caballero's Dictionary,
Madrid, 1856).--Stanley.

At that time the name for zacate (hay).--Rizal.

[252] In Japanese fimbari, larks (Medhurst's Japanese Vocabulary).

--Stanley.

[253] Pogos, from the Tagal pugo.--Rizal.

Delgado (ut supra) describes the pogos as certain small gray birds, very
similar to the sparrows in Spain. They are very greedy, and if
undisturbed would totally destroy the rice-fields. Their scientific
name is Excalfactoria chinensis (Linn.).

[254] Stanley conjectures that this word is a misprint for maynelas,
a diminutive of maina, a talking bird. Delgado (ut supra) describes
a bird called maya (Munia jagori--Cab.; Ploceus baya--Blyth.; and
Ploceus hypoxantha--Tand.), which resembles the pogo, being smaller
and of a cinnamon color, which pipes and has an agreeable song

.

[255] Stanley translates this as "wild ducks." Delgado (ut supra) describes
a bird called lapay (Dendrocygna vagans--Eyton.), as similar to the
duck in body, but with larger feet, which always lives in the water,
and whose flesh is edible.

[256] For descriptions of the birds in the Philippines, see Delgado
(ut supra) book v, part i, 1st treatise, pp. 813-853; Report of U.S.

Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, pp. 312-316; and Gazetteer of the
Philippine Islands (Washington, 1902), pp. 170, 171.

There are more than five hundred and ninety species of birds in the
islands, of which three hundred and twenty-five are peculiar to the
archipelago, and largely land birds.

There are thirty-five varieties of doves and pigeons, all edible.

[257] There are now domestic rabbits, and plenty of peacocks.

--Rizal.

[258] Doubtless the python, which is often domesticated in the
Philippines.

See VOL. XII, p. 259, note 73.

[259] La Gironiere (Twenty Years in the Philippines--trans. from
French, London, 1853) describes an interesting fight with a huge
crocodile near his settlement of Jala-Jala. The natives begged for
the flesh in order to dry it and use it as a specific against
asthma, as they believed that any asthmatic person who lived on the
flesh for a certain time would be infallibly cured.

Another native wished the fat as an antidote for rheumatic pain.

The head of this huge reptile was presented to an American, who in
turn presented it to the Boston Museum. Unfortunately La Gironiere's
picturesque descriptions must often be taken with a grain of salt. For
some information regarding the reptiles of the islands see Report of
U.S.

Philippine Commission,, 1900, iii, pp. 317-319.

[260] Unless we are mistaken, there is a fish in the Filipinas
called Pampano.

--Rizal.

[261] For catalogue and scientific description of the mollusks of
the Philippines, see the work of Joaquin Gonzalez Hidalgo--now
(1904) in course of publication by the Real Academia de Ciencias
of Madrid--Estudios preliminares sobre la fauna malacologica de las
Islas Filipinas

.

[262] The Rio Grande.--Rizal.

[263] No fish is known answering to this description.--Stanley.

[264] The island of Talim.--Rizal.

[265] Retana thinks (Zuniga, ii, p. 545*) that this device was
introduced among the Filipinos by the Borneans.

[266] A species of fishing-net. Stanley's conjecture is wrong.

[267] Esparavel is a round fishing-net, which is jerked along by the
fisher through rivers and shallow places.

Barredera is a net of which the meshes are closer and tighter than
those of common nets, so that the smallest fish may not escape
it.

[268] Cf. methods of fishing of North American Indians, Jesuit
Relations, vi, pp. 309-311, liv, pp. 131, 306-307

.

[269] A species of fish in the Mediterranean, about three pulgadas
[inches] long.

Its color is silver, lightly specked with black.

[270] The fish now called lawlaw is the dry, salted sardine.

The author evidently alludes to the tawilis of Batangas, or to the dilis,
which is still smaller, and is used as a staple by the natives.--Rizal.

For information regarding the fishes of the Philippines, see Delgado
(ut supra), book v, part iv, pp. 909-943; Gazetteer of the Philippine
Islands (ut supra), pp. 171-172; and (with description of methods
of fishing) Report of U.

S. Philippine Commission, 1900, iii, pp. 319-324.

[271] Paho.

A species of very small mango from one and one-half to five centimeters
in its longer diameter. It has a soft pit, and exhales a strong
pitchy odor.

--Rizal.

[272] A Spanish word signifying a cryptogamous plant; perhaps
referring to some species of mushroom

.

[273] In Tagal this is kasubha.

It comes from the Sanskrit kasumbha, or Malay kasumba (Pardo de Tavera's
El Sanscrito en la lengua tagalog).--Rizal.

This plant is the safflower or bastard saffron (Certhamus tinctorius);
its flowers are used in making a red dye.

[274] Not a tree, but a climber. The plants are cultivated
by training them about some canes planted in the middle of certain
little channels which serve to convey irrigation to the plant twice
each day.

A plantation of betel--or ikmo, as the Tagals call it--much resembles a
German hop-garden.--Rizal.

[275] This fruit is not that of the betel or buyo, but of the bonga
(Tagal bunga), or areca palm.--Rizal.

[276] Not quicklime, but well slaked lime.--Rizal.

Rizal misprints un poco de cal viva for vn poluc de cal viua.

[277] The original word is marcada. Rizal is probably correct in regarding
it as a misprint for mascada, chewed.

[278] It is not clear who call these caskets by that name. I
imagine it to be the Spanish name, properly spelt buxeta. The
king of Calicut's betel box is called buxen in the Barcelona MS. of the
Malabar coasts.--Stanley.

[279] See VOL. IV, p. 222, note 31; also Delgado (ut supra), pp. 667-669.
Delgado says that bonga signifies fruit

.

[280] Tagal, tuko.--Rizal.

[281] This word in the original is visitandolas; Rizal makes it irritandolas
(shaking or irritating them), but there are not sufficient grounds
for the change

.

[282] The Indians, upon seeing that wealth excited the rapacity of the
encomenderos and soldiers, abandoned the working of the mines, and
the religious historians assert that they counseled them to a
similar action in order to free them from annoyances.

Nevertheless, according to Colin (who was "informed by well-disposed
natives") more than 100,000 pesos of gold annually, conservatively
stated, was taken from the mines during his time, after eighty years
of abandonment.

According to "a manuscript of a grave person who had lived long in
these islands" the first tribute of the two provinces of Ilocos and
Pangasinan alone amounted to 109,500 pesos.

A single encomendero, in 1587, sent 3,000 taheles of gold in the
"Santa Ana," which was captured by Cavendish.

--Rizal.

[283] This was prohibited later.--Rizal.

[284] See VOL. XIV, pp. 301-304.

According to Hernando de los Rios the province of Pangasinan was said
to contain a quantity of gold, and that Guido de Labazaris sent some
soldiers to search for it; but they returned in a sickly state and
suppressed all knowledge of the mines in order not to be sent back
there.

The Dominican monks also suppressed all knowledge of the mines on
account of the tyranny of which gold had been the cause in the
West Indies.

--Stanley.

[285] Pearl-fishing is still carried on along the coasts of Mindanao
and Palawan, and in the Sulu archipelago.

In the latter region pearls are very abundant and often valuable; the
fisheries there are under the control of the sultan of Sulu,
who rents them, appropriating for himself the largest pearls

.

[286] Probably the cowry (Cypraea moneta). Crawfurd states (Dict. Ind.
Islands, p. 117) that in the Asiatic archipelago this shell is
found only on the shores of the Sulu group, and that it "seems never
to have been used for money among the Indian Islanders as it has
immemorially been by the Hindus

."

[287] Jagor, Travels in the Philippines (Eng. trans., London, 1875),
devotes a portion of his chapter xv to these jars.

He mentions the great prices paid by the Japanese for these vessels.
On p. 164, occurs a translation of the above paragraph, but it has been
mistranslated in two places.

Stanley cites the similar jars found among the Dyaks of Borneo--the best
called gusih--which were valued at from $1,500 to $3,000, while the
second grade were sold for $400. That they are very ancient is proved
by one found among other remains of probably the copper age. From the
fact that they have been found in Cambodia, Siam, Cochinchina, and
the Philippines, Rizal conjectures that the peoples of these countries
may have had a common center of civilization at one time

.

[288] "Not many years ago," says Colin (1663), "a large piece [of
ambergris] was found in the island of Jolo, that weighed more than
eight arrobas, of the best kind, namely, the gray."

--Rizal.

[289] This industry must now be forgotten, for it is never heard
of.--Rizal.

[290] Perhaps Morga alludes to the sinamay, which was woven from abaka,
or filament of the plant Musa textilis. The abaka is taken from
the trunk and not the leaf.--Rizal.

[291] This name seems to be Malay, Babu-utan, wild swine.--Stanley.

[292] The men of these islands were excellent carpenters and ship-builders.
"They make many very light vessels, which they take through the vicinity
for sale in a very curious manner. They build a large vessel,
undecked, without iron nail or any fastening. Then, according to
the measure of its hull, they make another vessel that fits into it.

Within that they put a second and a third. Thus a large biroco contains
ten or twelve vessels, called biroco, virey, barangay, and binitan."

These natives were "tattooed, and were excellent rowers and sailors;
and although they are upset often, they never drown."

The women are very masculine. "They do not drink from the rivers,
although the water is very clear, because it gives them nausea....
The women's costumes are chaste and pretty, for they wear petticoats
in the Bisayan manner, of fine medrinaque, and lamboncillos, which
resemble close-fitting sayuelos [i.e., woolen shifts worn by certain
classes of religious]. They wear long robes of the same fine
medrinaque. They gather the hair, which is neatly combed, into a
knot, on top of the head, and place a rose in it. On their forehead
they wear a band of very fine wrought gold, two fingers wide. It
is very neatly worked and on the side encircling the head it is
covered with colored taffeta. In each ear they wear three gold
earrings, one in the place where Spanish women wear them, and two
higher up. On their feet they wear certain coverings of thin brass,
which sound when they walk." (The citations herein are from Colin.)
These islands have also retrograded.--Rizal.
[293] Cavite derives its name from the Tagal word cavit, a creek,
or bend, or hook, for such is its form.--Stanley.
[294] This province had decreased so greatly in population and
agriculture, a half century later, that Gaspar de San Agustin
said:
"Now it no longer has the population of the past, because of the
insurrection of that province, when Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara
was governor of these islands, and because of the incessant cutting
of the timber for the building of his Majesty's ships, which prevents
them from cultivating their extremely fertile plain." Later, when
speaking of Guagua or Wawa, he says: "This town was formerly very
wealthy because of its many chiefs, and because of the abundant
harvests gathered in its spacious plains, which are now submerged
by the water of the sea."--Rizal.
[295] Now the port of Sorsogon.--Rizal.
[296] Now the port of Mariveles (?).--Rizal.
[297] Subik (?).--Rizal.
[298] Mindoro is at present [1890] so depopulated that the minister
of the Colonies, in order to remedy this result of Spanish colonization,
wishes to send there the worst desperadoes of the peninsula, to see
if great criminals will make good colonists and farmers. All things
considered, given the condition of those who go, it is indubitable
that the race that succeeds must know how to defend itself and live,
so that the island may not be depopulated again.--Rizal.
[299] Samar. This proves contrary to the opinion of Colin, who
places Tendaya in Leite.--Rizal.
[300] Southeastern part of Samar.--Rizal.
[301] Colin says, however, that they did tattoo the chins and about
the eyes [barbas y cejas]. The same author states also that the
tattooing was done little by little and not all at once. "The
children were not tattooed, but the women tattooed one hand and
part of the other. In this island of Manila the Ilocos also tattooed
themselves, although not so much as did the Visayans." The Negritos,
Igorrotes, and other independent tribes of the Filipinas still
tattoo themselves. The Christians have forgotten the practice. The
Filipinas used only the black color, thus differing from the Japanese,
who employ different colors, as red and blue, and carry the art to
a rare perfection.Then the Federal officer, with a face over which seemed to pass "the
shadow of unutterable things," looked first with a long, wistful,
absorbed glance toward the boy Charles, his brother--lastly, toward his
father.

"Why do you taunt me?" he said, in a low tone. "Will that result in any
good now? Yes, I committed murder. I intended, if I did not commit,
robbery. I killed--yes, I killed!--with a knife--as a murderer kills.
But I do not wish to kill you--or Charley--or this officer--or rob you.
Keep your life and your money. There is the road before you, open. Go;
you are free!"

General Davenant had sat his horse--the boy Charley beside
him--listening in sullen wrath. As Darke ended, the general's hand went
to the hilt of his sword, and he half drew it, by an instinctive
movement, from the scabbard.  "Well!" added the Federal officer, in the
same low tone, with a deeper flush in his cheeks, "draw your sword,
sir--strike me if you think proper. For myself, I am done with murder,
and shrink from it, so that, if my father wishes to kill me, I will
open my breast, to give him a fair opportunity. You see I am not
altogether the murderous wretch you take me for. I am a murderer, it is
true, and soiled with every vice--you see I am frank--but I will not
resist, if you plunge your sword into my heart. Strike! strike! While I
am dying I will have time to say the few words I have to say to you!"

General Davenant shuddered with wrath still, but a strange emotion was
mingled with the sentiment now--an emotion which I could not fathom.
Before he could open his lips, however, Darke resumed, in the same
tone:--

"You hesitate--you are not ready to become my executioner. Well,
listen, and I will utter that which may deprive you of all
self-control. Yes, once more, I killed a man, and killed him for money;
but _you_ made me what I was! You petted, and spoiled, and made me
selfish. In addition, you hated--that man. You had hated him for
twenty years. When I grew up, I found out that. If you did not strike
him, you had the desire to do so--and, like a good son, I shared my
'father's loves and hatreds.' I heard you speak of--him--harshly; I
knew that an old grudge was between you; what matter if I met this
enemy of the family on the high-road, and, with the dagger at his
throat, said: 'Yield me a portion of your ill-gotten gains!' for that
money was the proceeds of a forced sale for cash, by which the father
of a family was turned out of house and home! Well, I did that--and did
it under the effect of drink. I learned the habit at _your_ table; wine
was placed in my hands, in my very childhood, by you; you indulged all
my vile selfishness; made me a miserable, arrogant wretch; I came to
hang about the village tavern, and gamble, and fuddle myself, until I
was made worthless! Then, when one day the devil tempted me, I
committed a crime--and that crime was committed by _you_! for _you_
cultivated in me the vile habits which led me on to murder!"

Darke's eyes were gloomy, and full of a strange fire. As he uttered the
last words, he spurred close to his father, tore open his uniform until
his bare breast was visible, and added in accents full of vehement and
sullen passion:--

"Strike me! Bury your sword's point in my heart! I am your son. You are
as noble a gentleman as Brutus was! Kill me, then! I am a murderer: but
I am a Davenant, and no coward!"

From the fierce and swollen face, in which the dark eyes burned like
firebrands, my glance passed to the countenance of General Davenant. A
startling change had taken place in the expression of the old cavalier.
He was no longer erect, fiery, defiant. His glance no longer darted
scorn and anger. His chin had fallen upon his breast; his frame
drooped; his cheeks, but now so flushed, were covered with a deep
pallor.

For a moment he remained silent. The hand which had clutched at the
sword hilt hung listless at his side. All at once his breast heaved,
and with a sound which resembled a groan, he said, in low tones:--

"I am punished! Yes, my hatred has brought forth fruit, and the fruit
is bitter! It was I who warped this life, and the tree has grown as I
inclined it."

"Yes," said Darke, in his deep voice, "first warped--then, when cut
down, cast off and forgotten!"

General Davenant looked at the speaker with bitter melancholy.

"Ah! you charge me with that, do you, sir?" he said, "You do not
remember, then, that I have suffered for you--you do not know, perhaps,
that for ten years I have labored under the imputation of that crime,
and have preserved silence that I might shield your memory--for I
thought you dead! You do not know that I never breathed a syllable of
that letter which you sent to me on the day of my trial--that I have
allowed the world to believe I was saved by a legal technicality! You
have not heard, perhaps, that a daughter of Judge Conway is beloved by
your brother, and that her father rejects with scorn the very idea of
forming an alliance with _my_ son--the son of one whom he regards as
the murderer of his brother! Oh! yes, sir! truly I have cast off and

And drawing his pistol, he coolly discharged barrel after barrel in the
faces of the men rushing upon him; wheeled his horse, and dug the spurs
into him; an instant afterward, with his sneering face turned over his
shoulder, he had disappeared in the woods.

Two hours afterward I was on my way to Petersburg.

The enemy were already falling back from their adventurous attempt to
seize the Southside road.

In the morning they had retired across the Rowanty, and disappeared.

So ended that heavy blow at Lee's great war-artery.

 [Illustration: THE FLIGHT]


BOOK IV.


THE PHANTOMS.


I.


RICHMOND BY THE THROAT.


I was again back at the "Cedars," after the rapid and shifting scenes
which I have endeavored to place before the reader.

The tragic incidents befalling the actors in this drama, had most
absorbed my attention; but sitting now in my tent, with the newspapers
before me, I looked at the fight in which I had participated, from the
general and historic point of view.

That heavy advance on the Boydton road, beyond Lee's right, had been
simultaneous with a determined assault on the Confederate left, north
of James River, and on Lee's centre opposite Petersburg; and now the
extracts from Northern journals clearly indicated that the movement was
meant to be decisive.

"I have Richmond by the throat!" General Grant had telegraphed; but
there was good ground to believe that the heavy attack, and the
eloquent dispatch, were both meant to "make capital" for the
approaching Presidential election.

These memoirs, my dear reader, are written chiefly to record some
incidents which I witnessed during the war. I have neither time nor
space for political comments. But I laid my hand yesterday, by
accident, on an old number of the _Examiner_ newspaper; and it chanced
to contain an editorial on the fight just described, with some
penetrating views on the "situation" at that time.

Shall I quote a paragraph from the yellow old paper? It will be
bitter--we were all bitter in those days! though to-day we are so
fraternal and harmonious. With his trenchant pen, Daniel pierced to the
core of the matter; and the paper may give some idea of the spirit of
the times.

I could fancy the great satirist sitting in his lonely study, and
penning the lines I shall quote, not without grim smiles at his own
mordant humor.

Here is the slip I cut out. The old familiar heading may recall those
times to some readers, as clearly as the biting sentences, once read,
perhaps, by the camp-fire.


*    *    *    *    *    DAILY EXAMINER.   *    *    *    *    *
MONDAY MORNING   OCT. 31, 1864.     *    *    *    *    *

    "Every day must now bring its brilliant bulletin to the Yankee
    nation. That nation does not regard the punctual rising of the sun
    as more lawfully due to it than a victory every morning. And those
    glorious achievements of SHERIDAN in the Valley were grown cold and
    stale, and even plainly hollow and rotten--insomuch that, after
    totally annihilating the army of EARLY at least three times, and so
    clearing the way to Lynchburg, instead of marching up to Lynchburg
    the heroick victor goes whirling down to Winchester. Then the
    superb victory obtained on Sunday of last week over PRICE in
    Missouri, has taken a certain bogus tint, which causes many to
    believe that there was, in fact, no victory and no battle. This
    would not do. Something fresh must be had; something electrifying;
    above all, something that would set the people to cheering and
    firing off salutes about the very day of the election;--something,
    too, that could not be plainly contradicted by the events till
    after that critical day--then let the contradiction come and
    welcome: your true Yankee will only laugh.

    "From this necessity came the great 'reconnoissance in force' of
    last Thursday on our lines before Richmond and Petersburg; a
    'reconnoissance' in very heavy force indeed upon three points of
    our front at once both north and south of the James river; so that
    it may be very properly considered as three reconnoissances in
    force; made with a view of feeling, as it were, LEE'S position; and
    the object of the three reconnoissances having been fully
    attained--that is, LEE having been felt--they retired. That is the
    way in which the transactions of Thursday last are to appear in
    STANTON'S bulletin, we may be all quite sure; and this
    representation, together with the occupation of a part of the
    Boydton plank-road (which road the newspapers can call for a few
    days the Southside Road) will cause every city from Boston to
    Milwaukee to fire off its inevitable hundred guns. Thus, the
    Presidential election will be served, just in the nick of time; for
    that emergency it is not the real victory which is wanted, so much
    as the jubilation, glorification and cannon salutes.

    "Even when the truth comes to be fully known that this was the
    grand pre-election assault itself: the resistless advance on
    Richmond which was to lift the Abolitionists into power again upon
    a swelling high-tide of glory unutterable--easily repulsed and sent
    rolling back with a loss of about six or seven thousand men in
    killed, wounded and prisoners; even when this is known, does the
    reader imagine that the Yankee nation will be discouraged? Very far
    from it. On the contrary it will be easily made to appear that from
    these 'reconnoissances in force,' an advantage has been gained,
    which is to make the next advance a sure and overwhelming success.
    For the fact is, that a day was chosen for this mighty movement,
    when the wind was southerly, a soft and gentle breeze, which wafted
    the odour of the Yankee whiskey-rations to the nostrils of
    Confederate soldiers. The Confederates ought to have been taken by
    surprise that morning; but the moment they snuffed the tainted
    gale, they knew what was to be the morning's work. Not more
    unerring is the instinct which calls the vulture to the
    battle-field before a drop of blood is shed; or that which makes
    the kites 'know well the long stern swell, that bids the Romans
    close;' than the sure induction of our army that the Yankees are
    coming on, when morn or noon or dewy eve breathes along the whole
    line a perfumed savour of the ancient rye. The way in which this
    discovery may be improved is plain. It will be felt and understood
    throughout the intelligent North, that it gives them at last the
    key to Richmond. They will say--Those rebels, to leeward of us,
    smell the rising valour of our loyal soldiers: the filling and
    emptying of a hundred thousand canteens perfumes the sweet South as
    if it had passed over a bed of violets, stealing and giving
    odours:--when the wind is southerly it will be said, rebels know a
    hawk from a handsaw. On the very site of Manila, of which Rajamora
    made a donation to the Spaniards for their settlement, the adelantado
    founded his town and colony, on account of its strength and its
situation in a well-provisioned district, and in the midst of all
the other islands.

He left it its name of Manila which it had received from the natives.
[22] Taking sufficient land for the city, the governor established
therein his seat and residence, and fortified it with special care.
He paid more attention to the above, in order to make this new
settlement the seat of government, than to the temperature, and width
of the site, which is hot and narrow from having the river on one
side of the city and the bay on the other, while at the back are
to be found large swamps and marshes, which make the place very
strong.

From this post he continued to prosecute the pacification of the other
provinces of this great island of Luzon and of surrounding districts.
Some submitted voluntarily; others were conquered by force of arms
or by the efforts of the religious, who have sown the good seed
of the holy gospel therein.

Various of them have labored valiantly in this, not only in the time and
administration of Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, but also in
that of the governors that have succeeded him.

The land was apportioned among its conquerors and colonizers.

The capitals of provinces, the ports, and the settlements of cities
and towns which had been founded, and other special encomiendas,
were assigned to the royal crown, for the necessities that arise
and the expenses of the royal exchequer.

The affairs of government and the conversion of the natives were
treated as was necessary. Ships were provided for the annual voyage
to Nueva Espana, which return with the usual supplies. Thus
the condition of the Filipinas Islands has reached its present
known height in both spiritual and temporal matters.

Adelantado Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, as above-said, discovered the
islands, colonized them, and made a good beginning in the work of
pacification and subjugation. He founded the city of Sanctisimo Nombre
de Jesus in the provinces of Pintados, and then the city of Manila
in the island of Luzon. In this island he conquered the province of
Ylocos, in whose settlement and port called Vigan, he founded a Spanish
colony, to which he gave the name of Villa Fernandina. [23] He also
pacified the province of Pangasinan and the island of Mindoro, fixed
the amount of tribute that the natives were to pay throughout the
islands, [24] and made many ordinances concerning their government
and conversion, until his death in the year one thousand five hundred
and seventy-four, at Manila, where his body was buried in the monastery
of St. Augustine. [25]
At his death, there was found among his papers a sealed despatch from
the Audiencia of Mexico, which was governing when the fleet left
Nueva Espania, appointing a successor to the government, in case
of the death of the adelantado.

By virtue of this despatch, Guido de Labazarris, formerly a royal official,
took the office and was obeyed. He continued the conversion and
pacification of the islands with great wisdom, valor, and system, and
governed them.

During his term the pirate Limahon came from China, and attacked Manila
with a fleet of seventy large war-ships and many soldiers. He entered
the city, and, after killing the master-of-camp, Martin de Goiti, with
other Spaniards who were at his house, marched against the fort, in
which the Spaniards, who were but few, had taken refuge, with the
intention of seizing and subjecting the country. The Spaniards, reinforced
from Vigan by Captain Joan de Salzedo and his soldiers--for Salzedo
saw this pirate pass his coasts, and brought the reinforcement to
Manila--defended themselves so bravely that, after having killed
many of Limahon's men, they forced him to reembark, to leave the
bay in flight, and to take refuge in Pangasinan River.

The Spaniards went thither in search of him and burned his fleet. [26]
For many days they besieged this pirate on land, but he, taking
flight in small boats that he made there secretly, put to sea and
abandoned the islands.

During the government of this same Guido de Labazarris, trade and commerce
were established between Great China and Manila. Merchant ships
came every year and the governor received them kindly, and as a
consequence commerce has been growing ever since.

This same governor apportioned all the pacified land in the island of
Luzon and surrounding islands, to the conquerors and settlers
there. He assigned to himself the towns of Betis and Lubao in the
province of Pampanga, besides others of some importance. The
succeeding government dispossessed him of these towns; but afterward
his Majesty, on account of his good services, granted them all to
him, and he enjoyed them, together with the office of master-of-camp
of the islands, as long as he lived.

¶The administration of Doctor Francisco de Sande, and the events of the
Filipinas Islands during his term.

¶CHAPTER SECOND
When the news of the entrance and conquest of the Filipinas Islands
by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, and of his death, reached Espania, his
Majesty appointed as governor and captain-general of the islands,
Doctor Francisco de Sande, a native of Caceres, and alcalde of the
Audiencia of Mexico.

The latter journeyed thither, and took over his government in the year
one thousand five hundred and seventy-five.

During this administration, the pacification of the islands was continued,
especially that of the province of Camarines, by Captain Pedro Chaves,
who often came to blows with the natives, until he conquered them
and received their submission. A Spanish colony was founded there which
was called the city of Caceres. Among other enterprises, the governor
made in person the expedition to the island of Borneo with a fleet
of galleys and frigates. [27] With these he attacked and captured
the enemy's fleet, which had come out to meet him.

He captured also the principal settlement, where the king of the island
had his house and residence, but after a few days he abandoned it
and returned to Manila, on account of sickness among the crews, and
his inability to support and care for the Spaniards in that island.

On the way back, and by his orders, Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa
entered the island of Jolo; he came to blows with the natives and
their chief, whom he conquered, and the latter rendered him
acknowledgment and submission in the name of his Majesty.

Thence he went to the island of Mindanao which he explored,
reconnoitering its river and chief settlements.

On his way he reduced other towns and natives of the same island,
who had been pacified, to friendship and alliance with the Spaniards.

The governor despatched the ship "San Juanillo" to Nueva Espana,
under command of Captain Juan de Ribera, but it was lost at sea and
never heard of again.

Doctor Sande remained until Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa came
from Espania as the new governor and captain-general. After his
residencia the doctor returned to Nueva Espana to fill the office of
auditor of Mexico.

¶ Of the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa, and
of Diego Ronquillo, who filled the office because of the former's
death.

¶ CHAPTER THIRD

Because of the many accounts that had reached the court of his Majesty
concerning the affairs of the Filipinas, and because of their need of
being supplied with settlers and soldiers to pacify them, an arrangement
was made with Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de Penalosa, a native of Arevalo,
and chief alguacil of the Audiencia of Mexico, who was residing at
court, so that it might be done better and at less cost to the royal
exchequer. By this arrangement he was to be governor of the Filipinas
for life and was to take six hundred married and single men from the
kingdoms of Castilla to the Filipinas. His Majesty granted him certain
assistance and facilities for this purpose, together with other
favors as a reward for this service.

Don Gonzalo prepared for the voyage, raised his people, and embarked
them in the port of San Lucas Barremeda, but, as the fleet left
the bar, one of his ships was wrecked.

He returned in order to repair his losses, and, although he took
less than at first, he made his journey to the mainland, and at
Panama, embarked his people in the South Sea, and set sail for the
Filipinas, where he arrived and took over the government, in the
year one thousand five hundred and eighty.

Don Gonzalo Ronquillo founded a Spanish town in the island of
Panay, in Oton, which he named Arevalo. During his term, the trade
with the Chinese increased, and he built a market-place and Parian
for them within the city, where the Chinese could bring and sell
their merchandise. He tried to discover a return passage from the
islands to Nueva Espana, by way of the south, for which purpose he sent
his cousin, Captain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo. The latter could
not effect this, for after sailing for some time, until finding himself
near Nueva Guinea, he could go no farther, on account of many severe
storms, and returned to the Filipinas. In like manner, Don Gonzalo
sent another ship, under command of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo de
Vallesteros, to Peru, with some merchandise, in order to obtain
certain goods from those provinces which he said that the Filipinas
needed.

This vessel returned from Peru after the death of the governor. The
latter imposed the two per cent duty on the merchandise exported to
Nueva Espana, and the three per cent duty on the goods imported by the
Chinese to the Filipinas. Although he was censured for having done
this without his Majesty's orders, these duties remained in force, and
continued to be imposed thenceforward.

During this same term, as his Majesty had succeeded to the kingdoms of
Portugal, and had ordered the governor of Manila to maintain good
relations with the chief captain of the fortress of the island of
Tidore, in Maluco, and to assist him when necessary, he sent a fleet
and soldiers thither from Manila, under command of Captain Don Juan
Ronquillo del Castillo.

This he did at the request of Diego de Azambuja, chief captain of
Tidore, for the expedition and conquest of the island of Terrenate.
But after reaching Maluco, the expedition did not succeed in its
object. [28] Thenceforward supplies of men and provisions continued
to be sent from the Filipinas to the fortress of Tidore.

During this same administration, the province of Cagayan in the island
of Luzon, opposite China, was first pacified [29] by Captain Joan
Pablos de Carrion, who founded there a Spanish colony, which he named
Nueva Segovia. He also drove a Japanese pirate [30] from that
place, who had seized the port with some ships, and fortified himself
there.

A few days after Don Gonzalo Ronquillo had entered into the government,
he sent Captain Gabriel de Ribera with a small fleet, consisting
of one galley and several frigates, to explore the coast and
settlements of the island of Borneo, with orders to proceed thence
to the kingdom of Patan on the mainland, where pepper is produced.

The captain having coasted along and reconnoitered Borneo, returned
with his fleet to Manila, on account of the advanced season and
lack of provisions.

Thence the governor sent him to Espana, with authority from himself
and from the islands, to confer with his Majesty upon several matters
that he desired to see carried out, and upon others which would prove
advantageous to the islands. [31] The captain found his Majesty in
Portugal, gave him a few pieces of gold and other curiosities
which he had brought for that purpose, and stated the matters of
which he had come to treat.

The result was that his Majesty, among other favors, appointed him
marshal of Bonbon, for his hardships during this voyage, and the proper
resolution was made in the matters of which he had come to treat.

It was during the administration of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, that
the first bishop of the Filipinas was appointed, in the person of
Don Fray Domingo de Salazar, of the Dominican order, a man of great
learning and piety. As soon as he arrived in the islands, he took
upon himself the management and jurisdiction of ecclesiastical
affairs, which were at first in charge of the Augustinian friars
who had come at the time of the conquest, and afterwards of the
discalced Franciscan religious, who had arrived at the time of the
conversion. The bishop erected his cathedral in the city of Manila,
by apostolic bulls, with prebends paid by the royal exchequer,
until there should be tithes and ecclesiastical revenues to maintain
themselves. Moreover, he provided whatever else was necessary for the
service and decoration of the church, and for the divine worship
which is celebrated there with great solemnity and display. Don Fray
Domingo de Salazar took Antonio Sedeno and Alonso Sanchez, both priests
and grave members of the Society of Jesus, with him. They were
the first to establish that order in the Filipinas, which, since that
time, has been steadily growing, to the great profit and fruit
of the teaching and conversion of the natives, consolation of the
Spaniards, and the education and teaching of their children in the
studies which they pursue.

Don Gonzalo Ronquillo was in such poor health from the day on which
he entered upon his administration, that he died in the year one
thousand five hundred and eighty-three, and his body was buried
in the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila.

His kinsman, Diego Ronquillo, by virtue of his appointment through
a decree of his Majesty, succeeded him in the governorship; this man
continued what Don Gonzalo had commenced, especially in the assistance
for Maluco and pacification for other islands.

During the same term of Diego Ronquillo, a fire broke out in the city
of Manila, which started at midday in the church of the convent of
St. Augustine, while the doors of the church were closed. The fire
increased so rapidly that all the city was burned in a few hours, as
it was built of wood. There was great loss of goods and property,
and some persons were in danger. The city was rebuilt with great
difficulty and labor, leaving the Spaniards very poor and needy. [32]

The main result of the matters treated at court by Mariscal Gabriel
de Ribera was (although at that time the death of Governor Don
Gonzalo Ronquillo was unknown) to order the establishment of a royal
Audiencia in the city of Manila, whose president was to be governor and
captain-general of all the Filipinas.

In view of this, the necessary instructions were issued, and the
presidency given to Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, alcalde of the Audiencia
of Mexico, and a native of the town of Alcala de Henares. He went
to the islands with the usual reenforcements from Nueva Espana,
taking with him the royal seal of the Audiencia, the auditors whom his
Majesty was sending, the fiscal, and other officials and assistants
of the said Audiencia. The auditors and fiscal were Licentiates
Melchior de Avalos, Pedro de Rojas, and Gaspar de Ayala--[the latter]
as fiscal. At the end of two years, Don Antonio de Ribera went as third
auditor.

¶ Of the administration of Doctor Sanctiago de Vera, and of the establishment
of the Manila Audiencia, and until its suppression; and of events during
his term.

¶ CHAPTER FOURTH
The president and auditors arrived at the Filipinas in the month of
May, in the year 1584, while Diego Ronquillo was governing.
Doctor Sanctiago de Vera entered upon his office, and immediately
established the Audiencia.

The royal seal was received and deposited with all possible solemnity
and festivity. Then they began to attend to the affairs both of
justice and of war and government, to the great profit of the
country.

At this time new reenforcements were sent to Maluco for the conquests
that the chief captain of Tidore intended to make of the island of
Terrenate.

Captain Pedro Sarmiento [33] went from Manila for this purpose, and
on another occasion the captain and sargento-mayor, Juan de Moron;
[34] but neither of these expeditions met with the desired result.

President Sanctiago de Vera also continued the pacification of
several provinces of the islands, and did many things, which proved
advantageous in every respect.

He discovered a rebellion and insurrection which the native chiefs of
Manila and Pampanga had planned against the Spaniards, and justice
was done the guilty. [35] He built with stone the fortress of
Nuestra Senora de Guia [Our Lady of Guidance], within the city of
Manila on the land side, and for its defense he caused some artillery
to be founded by an old Indian, called Pandapira, a native of the
province of Panpanga.

The latter and his sons rendered this service for many years afterward,
until their deaths.

During the administration of President Sanctiago de Vera, the
Englishman Thomas Escander, [36] entered the South Sea through the
Strait of Magallanes; on the coast of Nueva Espana, close to
California, he had captured the ship "Santa Ana," which was coming
from the Filipinas laden with a quantity of gold and merchandise
of great value.

Thence he proceeded to the Filipinas; entering through the province of
Pintados, he came in sight of the town of Arevalo and of the shipyard
where a galleon was being built for the navigation of the Nueva Espana
line. Wishing to burn this vessel, he made the attempt, but he was
resisted by Manuel Lorenzo de Lemos, who was supervising its construction.
The Englishman passed on, and went to India, whence he took his
course to Inglaterra, having followed the same route which the Englishman
Francisco Draque [Francis Drake] [37] had taken several years before.
The latter had, in like manner, passed through the Strait of
Magallanes to the Peruvian coast, where he made many prizes.

At this time, the Audiencia and the bishop thought it advisable
that some person of sufficient and satisfactory qualities should
be sent to Espana, to the court of his Majesty, to give a thorough
and detailed account of the state of affairs in the Filipinas
Islands, and to request that some necessary measures might be taken
concerning them.

The court was especially to be informed that, for the time being,
the Audiencia could be dispensed with, for it was a heavy burden to
all estates, because of the newness of the country. The person of
Father Alonso Sanches, of the Society of Jesus, a learned man, and
one well informed concerning the country, and very active in business,
was chosen for this purpose.

Instructions were given him, and authority to act for all
estates, religious orders, and communities, as to what he was to
treat and request in Espana, and at the court of his Holiness in
Roma, where he was also to go. [38] This father reached Madrid, and
after having conferred with his Majesty several times respecting
those things of which he thought fit to treat and to make requests,
went to Roma, where he introduced himself as the ambassador of all
the estates of the Filipinas, and on their behalf he kissed the
foot, and visited the pontiffs who ruled during that time, after
the death of Sixtus the Fifth.

Having received from them favors and indulgences with many relics, bulls,
and letters for the Filipinas, he returned to Espana, where again
he solicited a decision on the business which he had left under
discussion when he went to Roma. His Majesty listened to the messages
that he brought from the pontiffs, and lent him a favorable ear
concerning the affairs of the islands. In private audiences the
father made the king understand his requests, and decide them to
his own satisfaction. But as soon as the despatches reached the Filipinas,
much of their contents appeared outside the intention and expectation
of both bishop and Audiencia, and the city, citizens, and encomenderos.
They appeared even detrimental to the inhabitants of the islands,
and therefore they expressed their displeasure toward Father Alonso
Sanches, who was still in Espana.

The father negotiated for the suppression of the Audiencia of Manila,
and the appointment of a new governor; and in begging such an one,
the same father, because of his friendly relations with him, proposed
one Gomez Perez Dasmarinas, who had been corregidor of Leon and
later of Murcia, and who was at that time in the court, and
corregidor-elect of Logrono and Calahorra.

His Majesty appointed him governor and captain-general of the Filipinas,
and increased the annual salary of his office to ten thousand
Castilian ducados. Moreover, he made him a knight of the Order of
Sanctiago, and gave him a large sum of money with which to meet the
expenses of the voyage. He was provided with the necessary despatches,
both for the exercise of his office, and for the suppression of the
Audiencia of Manila, and the establishment of a camp of four hundred
paid soldiers with their officers, at his Majesty's expense, for
the garrison and defense of the land.

"Beware of pirates," I said, "who make threats even in their
verses,--and now tell me, Miss Katy, if you are on a visit to
Petersburg? It will give me true pleasure to come and see you."

"Indeed you must!" she said, looking at me with the most fascinating
smile, "for you know you are one of my old friends now, and must not
neglect me. I am at my aunt's, Mrs. Hall,--uncle brought me a month ago
from Buckland; but in the morning I shall go down to a cousin's in
Dinwiddie."

"In Dinwiddie, Miss Katy?"

"Yes, near the Rowanty. My cousin, Mr. Dare, has come for me."

"Well, I will visit you there."

"Please do. The house is called 'Disaway's.'"

I bowed, smiling, and turned to Tom Herbert.

"When shall I see you again, Tom, and where? Next week--at Disaway's?"

Tom colored and then laughed. This dandy, you see, was a good boy
still.

"Well, old fellow," he replied, "I think it possible I may visit
Dinwiddie. My respected chieftain, General Fitz, is at present reposing
on his couch in Richmond, and I am bearer of bouquets as well as of
dispatches between him and his surgeon. But I am told he is ordered to
Dinwiddie as soon as he is up. The country is a new one; the thought
has occurred to me that any information I can acquire by--hem!--a
topographical survey, would be valuable. You perceive, do you not, my
dear friend? You appreciate my motive?"

"Perfectly, Tom. There will probably be a battle near 'Disaway's.'"

"And I'd better ride over the ground, eh?"

"Yes."

"Well, I'll do it!"

"Only beware of one thing!"

"What, my dear Surry?" asked Tom, anxiously.

"There is probably a conservatory at Disaway's."

"A conservatory?"

"Like that near Buckland, and the battle might take place _there_. If
it does--two to one you are routed!"

Katy blushed exquisitely, smiled demurely, and burst into laughter.
Then catching my eye she raised her finger, and shook her head with
sedate reproach, looking at Tom. He was laughing.

"All right, I'll look out, Surry!"

"Resolve on one thing, Tom."

"What is that?"

"That you will never surrender, but be taken in arms!"

With which mild and inoffensive joke I shook hands with Tom, informing
him where to find me; made Miss Katy a bow, which she returned with a
charming smile and a little inclination which shook together her
ringlets; and then leaving the young people to themselves, I mounted my
horse, and returned to the Cedars.

All the way I was smiling. A charming influence had descended upon me.
The day was brighter, the sunshine gayer, for the sight of the young
fellow, and the pretty little maiden, with her blue eyes, like the
skies, and her ringlets of silken gold!


VI.


ON THE BANKS OF THE ROWANTY.


When I again set out for the cavalry, a few days after the scene at
Blandford church, the youth and sunshine of those two faces still dwelt
in my memory, and I went along smiling and happy.

Not even the scenes on the late battle-field beyond the Rowanty, made
my mood gloomy; and yet these were not gay. The drawing-room,
especially, is splendid. Thence you go into a passage and a library,
which adjoins our private apartments. They showed us two sets of
apartments, and we chose those which are on the right hand of the
corridor or anteroom to the library. At eight we dined. Staying in the
house, besides ourselves, are the Buccleuchs and the two Ministers,
the Duchess of Sutherland and Lady Elizabeth Leveson Gower, the
Abercorns, Roxburghes, Kinnoulls, Lord Lauderdale, Sir Anthony
Maitland, Lord Lorne, the Fox Maules, Belhavens, Mr and Mrs William
Russell, Sir J. and Lady Elizabeth and the Misses Pringle, and two
Messrs Baillie, brothers of Lady Breadalbane.

The dining-room is a fine room in Gothic style, and has never been
dined in till this day.

Our apartments also are inhabited for the first time. After
dinner, the grounds were most splendidly illuminated--a whole chain of
lamps along the railings, and on the ground was written in lamps:
"Welcome Victoria--Albert." A small fort, which is up in the
woods, was illuminated, and bonfires were burning on the tops of the
hills. I never saw anything so fairy-like. There were some pretty
fireworks, and the whole ended by the Highlanders dancing reels, which
they do to perfection, to the sound of the pipes, by torchlight
in front of the house. It had a wild and very gay effect.'
[Illustration: Pass of Killiecrankie--'The Queen's View']
Her Majesty drove about daily, enjoying the magnificent scenery,
or by the banks of Tay, to see Lord Breadalbane's American buffaloes;
while Prince Albert had sport--nineteen roe-deer on the first day,
besides hares, pheasants, grouse, and a capercailzie, all which
trophies were spread out before the house.

Three hundred Highlanders 'beat' for him, while, whenever the Queen
(accompanied by the Duchess of Norfolk) walked in the grounds, two
of the Highland guard followed with drawn swords. They arrived
at a lodge, where 'a fat, good-humoured little woman, about forty,
cut some flowers for each of us, and the Duchess gave her some money,
saying: "From Her Majesty." I never saw any one more surprised than
she was; she, however, came up to me, and said very warmly that my
people were delighted to see me in Scotland.'

At a later date the Queen revisited Taymouth, where once--'Albert
and I were then only twenty-three!'--she passed such happy days. 'I was
very thankful to have seen it again,' says she, with quiet pathos. 'It
seemed unaltered.'
This visit to Scotland was attended with happy results, and made a
favourable impression upon both. 'The country,' wrote Prince Albert,'
is full of beauty, of a severe and grand character; perfect for sport
of all kinds, and the air remarkably pure and light in comparison
with what we have here.

The people are more natural, and marked by that honesty and sympathy which
always distinguish the inhabitants of mountainous countries who live
far away from towns.'
On the occasion of a visit to Blair-Athole, the Queen wrote of the
Pass of Killiecrankie, that it was 'quite magnificent; the road
winds along it, and you look down a great height, all wooded on
both sides; the Garry rolling below.'

On another occasion she wrote: 'We took a delightful walk of two
hours.

Immediately near the house, the scenery is very wild, which is most
enjoyable. The moment you step out of the house, you see those splendid
hills all round. We went to the left through some neglected pleasure-grounds,
and then through the wood, along a steep winding path overhanging
the rapid stream. These Scotch streams, full of stones, and clear
as glass, are most beautiful; the peeps between the trees, the
depth of the shadows, the mossy stones, mixed with slate, &c., which
cover the banks, are lovely; at every turn you have a picture. We
were up high, but could not get to the top; Albert in such delight; it
is a happiness to see him, he is in such spirits.

We came back by a higher drive, and then went to the factor's house,
still higher up, where Lord and Lady Glenlyon are living, having given
Blair up to us. We walked on to a cornfield, where a number of women
were cutting and reaping the oats ("shearing," as they call
it in Scotland), with a splendid view of the hills before us, so rural
and romantic, so unlike our daily Windsor walk (delightful as that
is); and this change does such good: as Albert observes, it
refreshes one for a long time.

We then went into the kitchen-garden, and to a walk from which there is
a magnificent view.
Nearly four years have passed, but I remember still his
courteous smile and friendly accents.

All at once, the figure of a young woman appeared in the doorway. At a
glance I recognized the golden ringlets of Katy Dare. She beckoned to
me, smiling; I rose and hastened to greet her; in a moment we were
seated upon the portico, conversing like old friends.

There was something fascinating in this child. The little maiden of
eighteen resembled a blossom of the spring. Were I a poet, I should
declare that her azure eyes shone out from her auburn hair like
glimpses of blue sky behind sun-tinted clouds!

I do not know how it came about, or how I found myself there, but in a
few moments I was walking with her in the autumn woods, and smiling as
I gazed into the deep blue of her eyes. The pines were sighing above
us; beneath our feet a thick carpet of brown tassels lay; and on the
summit of the evergreens the golden crown of sunset slowly rose, as
though the fingers of some unseen spirit were bearing it away into the
night.

Katy tripped on, rather than walked--laughing and singing gayly. The
mild air just lifted the golden ringlets of her hair, as she threw back
her beautiful face; her cheeks were rosy with the joy of youth; and
from her smiling lips, as fresh and red as carnations, escaped in sweet
and tender notes, like the carol of an oriole, that gay and warbling
song, the "Bird of "Beauty."

Do you remember it, my dear reader? It is old--but so many good things
are old!

  "Bird of beauty, whose bright plumage
    Sparkles with a thousand dyes:
  Bright thine eyes, and gay thy carol,
    Though stern winter rules the skies!"

Do you say that is not very grand poetry? I protest! friend, I think it
superior to the _chef d'oeuvres_ of the masters? You do not think so?
Ah! that is because you did not hear it sung in the autumn forest that
evening--see the ringlets of Katy Dare floating back from the rosy
cheeks, as the notes escaped from her smiling lips, and rang clearly in
the golden sunset. Do you laugh at my enthusiasm? Well, I am going to
increase your mirth. To the "Bird of Beauty" succeeded a song which I
never heard before, and have never heard since. Thus it is a lost pearl
I rescue, in repeating some lines. In this work, the best that is possible is done, for the mission-fields
are very large and extensive.

  In many districts the religious make use, in
  their visitas, of certain of the
  natives who are clever and
  well instructed, so that these may teach the others to pray daily,
instruct them in other matters touching religion, and see that they
come to mass at the central missions; and in this way they succeed
in preserving and maintaining their converts.

  Hitherto, the orders who control
  these missions in virtue of the
  omnimodo and other apostolic
  concessions [368] have attended to the conversion of the natives,
administered the sacraments, looked after the spiritual and temporal
and ecclesiastical affairs of the natives, and absolved them in
cases of difficulty.

But now that there are an archbishop and bishops, this is being
curtailed, and the management of these affairs is being given to the
bishops, as the archbishop's vicars--although not to such an extent,
nor has the administration of these natives been placed in their charge,
in matters of justice, and under the inspection and superintendence
of the bishops, as they have endeavored to obtain. [369]
The governor and royal Audiencia of Manila attend to what it is advisable
to provide and direct for the greatest accomplishment and advancement
of this conversion, and the administration of the natives and their
missions--both by causing the encomenderos to assist the religious
and churches, in the encomiendas that they enjoy, with the stipends
and necessary expenses of the missions; and by furnishing from the
royal revenues what pertains to it, which is no less a sum. [370]
They also ordain whatever else is required to be provided and
remedied for the said missions and for the advancement of the
natives.

This also is attended to by the archbishop and the bishops in what pertains
to them in their duty and charge as pastors.

The Holy Office of the Inquisition, residing in Mexico of Nueva Espana,
has its commissaries, servants, and helpers in Manila and in the
bishoprics of the islands, who attend to matters touching the Holy
Office.

They never fail to have plenty to do there because of the entrance of
so many strangers into those districts. However, this holy tribunal
does not have jurisdiction of the causes pertaining to the natives,
as the latter are so recently converted.

All these islands are subdued, and are governed from Manila by means of
alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, and lieutenants, each of whom rules and
administers justice in his own district and province.

  Appeals from
     their acts and sentences
  go to the royal Audiencia. The governor
     and captain-general provides what pertains to government and war.

The chiefs, who formerly held the other natives in subjection, now
have no power over them in the tyrannical manner of former days.

This was not the least benefit received by these natives in having
been freed from such servitude.

However, it is true that matters touching the slavery of former
days have remained on the same footing as before.

The king our sovereign has ordered by his decrees that the honors
of the chiefs be preserved to them as such; and that the other
natives recognize them and assist them with certain of the labors
that they used to give when pagans.

This is done with the lords and possessors of barangays,
and those belonging to such and such a barangay are under that
chief's control. When he harvests his rice, they go one day to
help him; and the same if he builds a house, or rebuilds one.
This chief lord of a barangay collects tribute from his adherents, and
takes charge of these collections, to pay them to the encomendero.
[371]
Besides the above, each village has a governor [372] who is elected.
He and his constables who are called vilangos [373] comprise the usual
magistracy among the natives. The governor hears civil suits where
a moderate sum is involved; in appeal, the case goes to the
corregidor or alcalde-mayor of the province. These governors are elected
annually by the votes of all the married natives of such and such
a village.

The governor of Manila confirms the election, and gives the title of
governor to the one elected, and orders him to take the residencia
of the outgoing governor. [374] This governor, in addition to the vilangos
and scrivener (before whom he makes his acts in writing, in the
language of the natives of that province), [375] holds also the
chiefs--lords of barangays, and those who are not so--under his
rule and government, and, for any special service, such as collections
of tributes, and assignments of personal services, as his datos and
mandones. [376] They do not allow the chiefs to oppress the timaguas
or slaves under their control.

The same customs observed by these natives in their paganism, are
observed by them since they have become Christians, in so far as
they are not contrary to natural law, especially as to their slavery,
successions, inheritances, adoptions, wills, and lawful trading.

In their suits, they always allege and prove the custom, and are judged
by it, according to royal decrees to that effect. In other causes
which do not involve their customs, and in criminal cases, the
matter is determined by law as among Spaniards.

All of these islands and their natives, so far as they were
pacified, were apportioned into encomiendas from the beginning. To
the royal crown were allotted those which were chief towns and
ports, and the dwellers of the cities and towns; and also other
special encomiendas and villages in all the provinces, for the
necessities and expenses of the royal estate. All the rest was assigned
to the conquerors and settlers who have served and labored for the
conquest and pacification, and in the war. This matter is in charge
of the governor, who takes into consideration the merits and services
of the claimants. [377] In like manner the villages that become
vacant are assigned. There are many very excellent encomiendas
throughout the islands, and they offer many profits, both by the
amount of their tributes and by the nature and value of what is paid as
tribute. [378] The encomienda lasts, according to the royal laws and
decrees, and by the regular order and manner of succession to them,
for two lives; but it may be extended to a third life, by permission.
After it becomes vacant, it is again assigned and granted anew.

The tributes paid to their encomenderos by the natives were assigned
by the first governor, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, in the provinces of
Vicayas and Pintados, and in the islands of Luzon and its vicinity;
they were equal to the sum of eight reals annually for an entire
tribute from each tributario.

The natives were to pay it in their products--in gold, cloth, cotton,
rice, bells, fowls, and whatever else they possessed or harvested.
The fixed price and value of each article was assigned so that, when the
tribute was paid in any one of them, or in all of them, it should not
exceed the value of the eight reals. So it has continued until
now, and the governors have increased the appraisements and values of
the products at different times, as they have deemed advisable.

The encomenderos have made great profits in collecting in kind, for,
after they acquired possession of the products, they sold them at
higher prices. By this they increased their incomes and the proceeds of
their encomiendas considerably; until a few years ago his Majesty, by
petition of the religious and the pressure that they brought to
bear on him in this matter, ordered for this region that the natives
should pay their tribute in whatever they wished--in kind or in
money--without being compelled to do otherwise.

Consequently, when they should have paid their eight reals, they would
have fulfilled their obligation. Accordingly this rule was initiated;
but experience demonstrates that, although it seemed a
merciful measure, and one favorable to the natives, it is doing
them great injury.

  For, since they naturally dislike to work, they do not sow, spin,
dig gold, rear fowls, or raise other food supplies, as they did
before, when they had to pay the tribute in those articles.

They easily obtain, without so much work, the peso of money which
is the amount of their tribute.

  Consequently it follows that the natives
     have less capital
  and wealth, because they do not
     work; and the country, which
  was formerly very well provided
    and well-supplied with all products, is now suffering want and
deprivation of them.

The owners of the encomiendas, both those of his Majesty and those of
private persons who possess them, have sustained considerable loss and
reduction in the value of the encomiendas.

When Gomez Perez Dasmarinas was appointed governor of the Filipinas,
he brought royal decrees ordering the formation of the camp in
Manila, with an enrollment of four hundred paid soldiers, with their
officers, galleys, and other military supplies, for the defense and
security of the country.

Before that time all the Spanish inhabitants had attended to that
without any pay.

  Then an increase of two reals to
  each tributario over the eight reals was ordered.

This was to be collected by the encomenderos at the same time when
they collected the eight reals of the tribute, and was to be
delivered and placed in the royal treasury.

  There this amount was to be entered on an account
  separate from that of the other revenue of his
  Majesty, and was to be applied in the following
  manner: one and one-half reals for the expenses of the said camp
and war stores; and the remaining half real for the pay of the
prebendaries of the Manila church, which his Majesty pays from his
treasury, until such time as their tithes and incomes suffice for
their sustenance. [379]
These tributes are collected from all the natives, Christians and
infidels, in their entirety--except that in those encomiendas without
instruction the encomendero does not take the fourth part of the
eight reals (which equals two reals) for himself, since that
encomienda has no instruction or expenses for it; but he takes them
and deposits them in Manila, in a fund called "the fourths." [380]
The money obtained from this source is applied to and spent in
hospitals for the natives, and in other works beneficial to them,
at the option of the governor.

As fast as the encomiendas are supplied with instruction and religious,
the collection of these fourths and their expenditure in these special
works cease.

Some provinces have taken the census of their natives; and according
to these the tributes and the assignment of the two reals are
collected.

  In most of the provinces no census
     has been taken, and the
  tributes are collected when due
     by the encomenderos and
  their collectors, through the chiefs
     of their encomiendas, by
  means of the lists and memoranda
     of former years.

  From them the names of the deceased and
     of those who have changed
  their residence are erased, and the names
     of those who have grown up,
  and of those who have recently
     moved into the encomienda,
  are added. When any shortage is
     perceived in the accounts, a new count is requested and made.

  The natives are free to move
     from one island to another, and
  from one province to another,
     and pay their tribute
  for that year in which they move
     and change their residence
  in the place to which they move; and
     to move from a Christian village that has instruction to another
village possessing it.

 But, on the other hand, they may not
     move from a place having
  instruction to one without
     it, nor in the same
  village from one barangay to
     another, nor from one faction
  to another. In this respect,
     the necessary precautions are made by the government, and the
necessary provisions by the Audiencia, so that this system may be
kept, and so that all annoyances resulting from the moving of the
settled natives of one place to another place may be avoided.

  Neither are the natives allowed
     to go out of their villages
  for trade, except by permission of
     the governor, or of his
  alcaldes-mayor and justices, or even
     of the religious, who most
  often have been embarrassed by this,
     because of the instruction.

This is done so that the natives may not wander about aimlessly when
there is no need of it, away from their homes and settlements.

Those natives who possess slaves pay their tributes for them if the
slaves are saguiguilirs. If the slaves are namamahays living outside
their owners' houses, they pay their own tributes, inasmuch as
they possess their own houses and means of gain.

The Spaniards used to have slaves from these natives, whom they had
bought from them, and others whom they obtained in certain expeditions
during the conquest and pacification of the islands.

This was stopped by a brief of his Holiness [381] and by royal
decrees.

Consequently, all of these slaves who were then in the possession of the
Spanish, and who were natives of these islands, in whatever manner
they had been acquired, were freed; and the Spaniards were forever
prohibited from holding them as slaves, or from capturing them for
any reason, or under pretext of war, or in any other manner.

The service rendered by these natives is in return for pay and daily
wages. The other slaves and captives that the Spaniards possess are
Cafres and blacks brought by the Portuguese by way of India, and are
held in slavery justifiably, in accordance with the provincial
councils and the permissions of the prelates and justices of those
districts.

The natives of these islands have also their personal services, which
they are obliged to render--in some parts more than in others--to
the Spaniards. These are done in different ways, and are commonly called
the polo. [382] For, where there are alcaldes-mayor and justices,
they assign and distribute certain natives by the week for the
service of their houses. They pay these servants a moderate wage,
which generally amounts to one-fourth real per day, and rice for their
food.

The same is done by the religious for the mission, and for their
monasteries and churches, and for their works, and for public works.
[383]

The Indians also furnish rice, and food of all kinds, at the
prices at which they are valued and sold among the natives.

These prices are always very moderate. The datos, vilangos, and fiscals
make the division, collect, and take these supplies from the natives;
and in the same manner they supply their encomenderos when these go
to make the collections.

The greatest service rendered by these natives is on occasions of war,
when they act as rowers and crews for the vireys and vessels that go
on the expeditions, and as pioneers for any service that arises
in the course of the war, although their pay and wages are given
them.

In the same way natives are assigned and apportioned for the king's
works, such as the building of ships, the cutting of wood, the trade
of making the rigging, [384] the work in the artillery foundry,
and the service in the royal [385] magazines; and they are paid
their stipend and daily wage.

In other things pertaining to the service of the Spaniards and their
expeditions, works, and any other service, performed by the natives,
the service is voluntary, and paid by mutual agreement; [386] for,
as hitherto, the Spaniards have worked no mines, nor have they given
themselves to the gains to be derived from field labors, there is no
occasion for employing the natives in anything of that sort.

Most of the Spaniards of the Filipinas Islands reside in the city
of Manila, the capital of the kingdom, and where the chief trade
and commerce is carried on. Some encomenderos live in provinces
or districts adjacent to Manila, while other Spaniards live in the
cities of Segovia, Caceres, Santisimo Nombre de Jesus (in Sebu), and
in the town of Arevalo, where they are settled, and where most of them
have their encomiendas.

Spaniards may not go to the Indian villages, [387] except for the
collection of the tributes when they are due; and then only the
alcaldes-mayor, corregidors, and justices.

It is not permitted these to remain continually in one settlement of
their district, but they must visit as much of it as possible. They
must change their residence and place of abode every four months to
another chief village and settlement, where all the natives may obtain
the benefit of their presence; and so that the natives may receive as
slight annoyance as possible in supporting them and in the ordinary
service that they render them. [388]
The governor makes appointments to all offices.

The tree was
young and lusty; the spring was not over; freshness and verdure should
have clothed it; and yet it appeared to have been blasted. What had
dried up its sap, I asked myself--withering and destroying it? What
thunder-bolt had struck this sturdy young oak? I could not answer--but
from the first moment of our acquaintance, Mohun became for me a
problem.

Then the second phase presented itself. When I met him in the
Wilderness, in May, 1864, a great change had come over him. He was no
longer bitter and cynical. The cloud had plainly swept away, leaving
the skies of his life brighter. Gayety had succeeded gloom. The
rollicking enjoyment of the true cavalryman had replaced the
recklessness of the man-hater. Again I looked at him with
attention--for his courage had made me admire him, and his hidden grief
had aroused my sympathy. A great weight had plainly been lifted from
his shoulders; he breathed freer; the sap long dried up had begun to
flow again; and the buds told that the leaves of youth and hope were
about to reappear. What was the meaning of that?

Now the third phase of the man had come to excite in me more surprise
and interest than the former ones. This time the change was complete.
Mohun seemed no longer himself. Was the man riding beside me the old
Mohun of 1863? Where was the gloomy misanthropy--where the rollicking
humor? They had quite disappeared. Mohun's glance was gentle and his
countenance filled with a charming modesty and sweetness. His voice,
once so cold, and then so hilarious, had grown calm, low, measured,
almost soft. His smile was exquisitely cordial; his glance full of
earnestness and sweetness. The heaven-born spirit of kindness--that
balm for all the wounds of human existence--shone in his eyes, on his
lips, in every accent of his voice.

Colonel Mohun had been reckless, defiant, unhappy, or wildly gay.
General Mohun was calm, quietly happy it seemed. You would have said of
him, formerly, "This is a man who fights from hatred of his enemies, or
the exuberant life in him." Now you would have said, "This is a patriot
who fights from principle, and is worthy to die in a great cause."

What had worked this change? I asked myself once more. Was it love? Or
was it the conviction which the Almighty sends to the most hardened,
that life is not made to indulge hatred, but to love and perform our
duty in?

I knew not; but there was the phenomenon before me. Mohun was certainly
a new man, and looked on life and the world around him with a
gentleness and kindness of which I had believed him incapable.

"I am going to take you to see a somewhat singular character," he said.

"Who is he?"

"It is a woman."

"Ah!"

"And a very strange one, I promise you, my dear Surry."

"Lead on, I'll follow thee!"

"Good! and I declare to you, I think Shakespeare would have examined
this human being with attention."

"She is a phenomenon, then?"

"Yes."

"A witch?"

"No, an epileptic; at least I think so."

"Indeed! And where does she live?"

"On the Halifax road, some miles from the Rowanty."

"In the lines of the enemy, then?"

"Something like it."

"Humph!"

"Don't disturb yourself about that, Surry. I have sent out a scouting
party who are clearing the country. Their pickets are back to Reams's
by this time, and there is little danger."

"At all events, we'll share any, Mohun. Forward!"

And we pushed on to the Halifax bridge, where, as Mohun expected, there
was no Federal picket.

The bridge--a long rough affair--had been half destroyed by General
Hampton; but we forded near it, pushed our horses through the swamp,
amid the heavy tree trunks, felled to form an abatis, and gaining the
opposite bank of the Rowanty, rode on rapidly in the direction of
Petersburg, that is to say, toward the rear of the Federal army.

AMANDA.


Half an hour's ride through the swampy low grounds rising to gentle
uplands, and beneath the festoons of the great vines trailing from tree
to tree, brought us in front of a small house, half buried in a clump
of bushes, like a hare's nest amid brambles.

"We have arrived!" said Mohun, leading the way to the cabin, which we
soon reached.

Throwing his bridle over a bough near the low fence, Mohun approached
the door on foot, I following, and when close to the door, he gave a
low knock.

"Come in!" said a cheerful and smiling voice.

And Mohun opened the door, through which we passed into a small and
very neat apartment containing a table, some chairs, a wide fireplace,
in which some sticks were burning, a number of cheap engravings of
religious scenes, framed and hanging on the wall, and a low bed, upon
which lay a woman fully dressed.

She was apparently about thirty-five, and her appearance was
exceedingly curious. Her figure was slender and of medium height; her
complexion that of a Moorish or oriental woman, rather than that of the
quadroon, which she appeared to be; her hair black, waving, and
abundant; her eyes as dark and sparkling as burnished ebony; and her
teeth of dazzling whiteness. Her dress was neat, and of bright colors.
Around her neck she wore a very odd necklace, which seemed made of
carved bone; and her slender fingers were decorated with a number of
rings.[1]

[Footnote 1: "I have endeavored to give an exact description of this
singular woman." Colonel Surry said to me when he read this passage to
me: "She will probably be remembered by numbers of persons in both the
Federal and Confederate armies. These will tell you that I describe her
accurately, using her real name, and will recall the strange prediction
which she made, and which I repeat. Was she an epileptic? I do not
know. I have certainly never encountered a more curious
character!"--EDITOR.]

Such was the personage who greeted us, in a voice of great calmness and
sweetness, as we entered. She did not rise from the bed upon which she
was lying; but her cordial smile clearly indicated that this did not
arise from discourtesy.

"Take seats, gentlemen," she said, "and please excuse me from getting
up. I am a little poorly to-day."

"Stay where you are, Amanda," said Mohun, "and do not disturb
yourself."

She looked at him with her dark eyes, and said, in her gentle, friendly
voice:--

"You know me, I see, General Mohun."

"And you me, I see, Amanda."

"I never saw you before, sir, but--am I mistaken?"

"Not in the least. How did you know me?"

The singular Amanda smiled.

"I have _seen you_ often, sir."

"Ah--in your visions?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or, perhaps, Nighthawk described me. You know Mr. Nighthawk!"

"Oh, yes, sir. I hope he is well. He has often been here; he may have
told me what you were like, sir, and then I _saw you_ to know you
afterward."

I looked at the speaker attentively. Was she an impostor? It was
impossible to think so. There was absolutely no evidence whatever that
she was acting a part--rather every thing to forbid the supposition, as
she thus readily acquiesced in Mohun's simple explanation.

For some moments Mohun remained silent. Then he said:--

"Those visions which you have are very strange. Is it possible that you
really _see_ things before they come to pass--or are you only amusing
yourself, and others, by saying so? I see no especial harm in the
matter, if you are jesting; but tell me, for my own satisfaction and
that of my friend, if you _really_ see things."

Amanda smiled with untroubled sweetness.

"I am in earnest, sir," she said, "and I would not jest with you and
Colonel Surry."

I listened in astonishment.

"Ah! you know me, too, Amanda!"

"Yes, sir--or I think I do. I think you are Colonel Surry, sir."

"How do you know that?"

"I have _seen you, too_, sir?" was the smiling reply.

I sat down, leaned my head upon my hand, and gazed at this
incomprehensible being. Was she really a witch? I do not believe in
witches, and at once rejected that theory. If not an impostor, then,
only one other theory remained--that Nighthawk had described my person
to her, in the same manner that he had Mohun's, and the woman might
thus believe that she had seen me, as well as my companion, in her
"visions."

To her last words, however, I made no reply, and Mohun renewed the
colloquy, as before.

"Then you are really in earnest, Amanda, and actually see, in vision,
what is coming to pass?" he said.

"I think I do, sir."

"Do you have the visions often?"

"I did once, sir, but they now seldomer come."

"What produces them?"

"I think it is any excitement, sir. They tell me that I lay on my bed
moaning, and moving my arms about,--and when I wake, after these
attacks, I remember seeing the visions."

"I hear that you predicted General Hunter's attack on Lexington last
June."

"Yes, sir, I told a lady what _I saw_, some months before it came to
pass."

"What did you see? Will you repeat it for us?"

"Oh, yes, sir. I remember all, and will tell you about it, as it seems
to interest you. I saw a town, on the other side of the mountain, which
they afterward told me was called Lexington--but I did not know its
name then--and a great army of men in blue dresses came marching in,
shouting and cheering. The next thing I saw was a large building on
fire, and through the windows I saw books burning, with some curious-
looking things, of which I do not know the names."

"The Military Institute, with the books and scientific apparatus," said
Mohun, calmly.

"Was it, sir? I did not know."

"What did you see afterward, Amanda?"

"Another house burning, sir; the Federal people gave the ladies ten
minutes to leave it, and then set it on fire."

Mohun glanced at me.

"That is strange," he said; "do you know the name of the family?"

"No, sir."

"It was Governor Letcher's. Well, what next?"

"Then they went in a great crowd, and broke open another building--a
large house, sir--and took every thing. Among the things they took was
a statue, which they did not break up, but carried away with them."

"Washington's statue!" murmured Mohun; and, turning to me, he
added:--

"This is curious, is it not, Surry?"

I nodded.

"_Very_ curious."

I confess I believed that the strange woman was trifling with us, and
had simply made up this story after the event. Mohun saw my
incredulity, and said, in a low tone:--

"You do not believe in this?"

"No," I returned, in the same tone.

"And yet one thing is remarkable."

"What?"

"That a lady of the highest character assured me, the other day, that
all this was related to her before Hunter even entered the Valley."[1]

[Footnote 1: Fact.]

And turning to Amanda, he said:--

"When did you see these things?"

"I think it was in March, sir."

The words were uttered in the simplest manner possible. The strange
woman smiled as sweetly as she spoke, and seemed as far from being
guilty of a deliberate imposture as before.

"And you _saw_ the fight at Reams's, too?"

"Yes, sir; I saw it two months before it took place. There was a man
killed running through the yard of a house, and they told me,
afterward, he was found dead there."

"Have you had any visions, since?"

"Only one, sir."

"Lately?"

"Yes, sir."

"What did you see?"

"It was not much, sir. I saw the Federal people on horses, watering
their horses in a large river somewhere west of here, and the vision
said the war would be over about next March."

Mohun smiled.

"Which side will be successful, Amanda?"

"The vision did not say, sir."[1]

[Footnote 1: Colonel Surry assured me that he had scrupulously searched
his memory to recall the exact words of this singular woman: and that
he had given the precise substance of her statements; often, the exact
words.--ED.]

Mohun, who had taken his seat on a rude settee, leaned his elbow on his
knee, and for some moments gazed into the fire.

"I have asked you some questions, Amanda," he said at length, "relating
to public events. I _now come to some private matters_--those which
brought me hither--in which your singular visions may probably assist
me. Are you willing to help me?"

"Yes, indeed, sir, if I can," was the reply.


XI.


DEEP UNDER DEEP.


Mohun fixed his mild, and yet penetrating glance upon the singular
woman, who sustained it, however, with no change in her calm and
smiling expression.

"You know Nighthawk?"

"Oh, yes, sir. He has been here often."

"And Swartz?"

"Very well, sir--I have known him many years."

"Have you seen him, lately?"

"No, sir; not for some weeks."

"Ah! You saw him some weeks since?"

"Yes, sir."

"At this house?"

"Yes, sir."

"Do you know what has become of him?"

"No, sir; but I suppose he is off somewhere."

"He is dead!"

Her head rose slightly, but the smile was unchanged.

"You don't tell me, sir!"

"Yes, murdered; perhaps you know his murderer?"

"Who was it, sir?"

"Colonel Darke."

"Oh, I know _him_. He has been here, lately. Poor Mr. Swartz! And so
they murdered him! I am sorry for him."

Mohun's glance became more penetrating.

"You say that Colonel Darke has been here lately?"

"Yes, sir."

"What was the occasion of his visit?"

"I don't know, sir; unless it was to hear me tell my visions."

"You never knew him before?"

Amanda hesitated.

"Yes, sir," she said at length.

"When, and how?"

"It was many years ago, sir;--I do not like to speak of these things.
He is a terrible man, they say."

"You can speak to me, Amanda. I will repeat nothing; nor will Colonel
Surry."

The singular woman looked from Mohun to me, evidently hesitating. Then
she seemed suddenly to make up her mind, and said, with her eternal
smile:--

"I will tell you, then, sir. I can read faces, and I know neither you
nor Colonel Surry will get me into trouble."

"I will not--on my honor."

This pirate, although, so crippled, had the good the crew, artillery,
and a portion great of its ammunition and clothing, were saved.

After setting fire to the ship, and taking what nails and bolts they
could, so that the Mindanaos could not make use of them, the fleet
continued its voyage.

The galleys coasted along the island of Mindanao, and the ships and
other deep-draught vessels sailed in the open sea, all making for the
port of Talangame, in the island of Terrenate the land, and with its
artillery and crew and the people of Terrenate. The master-of-camp

six hundred men of Tidore.

On that day he anchored in a harbor between the settlement and the

resented it greatly. This was one of the, greatest dangers that has
threatened Manila, for the Spaniards were few in number, and the
Japanese more than one thousand five hundred, and they are a spirited
and very mettlesome race. Had come to blows on occasion, the Spaniards
would have fared ill[204] The governor, upon entering Manila, with

by a big Dutch, well equipped with artillery, which was anchored

treaties with Tidore and Terrenate, in order to be protected against
the Castilians Portuguese.

The master-of-camp had the king of Tidore summoned immediately, and,
while as governor of Maluco; he also left there one large forge and a
number of smiths, sixty-five pioneers, thirty-five stonecutters,
two galliots, two well-armed brigantines, and crews of rowers.

The other company of soldiers[was to be stationed] in I Tidore under
command of Captain Alarcon; while ammunition and provisions for one
year were left in both forts.

He was acting as governor there and had but little security from
the natives, who, being a Mahometan people, and by nature easily
persuaded and fickle, are restless, and ready for disturbances and

.
I have scarcely ever witnessed a
more furious tempest; the thunder and lightning were fearful, and I
pushed my horse to his utmost speed to reach Fonthill before the
torrents of rain drenched me to the skin.

"Well, I had entered the Fonthill woods, a mile or two from the house,
and was galloping at full speed through the black darkness which the
lightning only occasionally illumined now, when all at once my horse
struck his chest against something. I heard a cry, and then a dazzling
flash showed me a light carriage which had evidently just been
overturned. I was nearly unseated by the collision, but leaped to the
ground, and at the same moment another flash showed me the form of a
lady whom a man was extricating from the broken vehicle. I hastened to
render my assistance. The lady was lifted in our arms, and then I aided
in raising the fallen horse, who lay on his side, frightened and
kicking violently.

"Ten minutes afterward I was placed in possession of what the lawyers
call 'the facts of the case.' Mr. Mortimer, of Georgia, was travelling
home from the North, with his sick sister in his carriage, for the
benefit of her health. They had lost their way; the storm had caught
them; their carriage had overturned in the darkness,--where could Mr.
Mortimer obtain lodgings for the night? The condition of his sister
rendered it imperative that they should not continue their journey
until morning, even if the storm and broken vehicle permitted.

"I listened, and felt a warm sympathy for the poor sick girl--she was
only a girl of eighteen, and very beautiful. I would gladly have
offered my own house, but it was still some miles distant, and the
young woman was so weak, and trembled so violently, that it would
plainly be impossible to conduct her so far on foot. True, my carriage
might have been sent for her, but the rain was now descending in
torrents; before it arrived she would be drenched--something else must
be thought of. All at once the idea occurred to me, 'Parson Hope's is
only a quarter of a mile distant.' Mr. Hope was the parson of the
parish, and a most excellent man. I at once suggested to Mr. To their
disappointment, however, the Russians met with a most stubborn
resistance from the Turks, and utterly failed to take the fortress of
Silistria, where the besieged were encouraged and directed by some
British officers."The good parson received us in a manner which showed his conviction
that to succor the stranger or the unfortunate is often to 'entertain
angels unawares.' It is true that on this occasion it was something
like a brace of devils whom he received into his mansion! The young
lady threw herself into a seat; seemed to suffer much; and was soon
conducted by the parson's old housekeeper--for he was a childless
widower--to her chamber in which a fire had been quickly kindled. She
disappeared, sighing faintly, but in those few minutes I had taken a
good look at her. You have seen her; and I need not describe her. She
is still of great beauty; but at that time she was a wonder of
loveliness. Slender, graceful, with a figure exquisitely shaped; with
rosy lips as artless as an infant's; grand dark eyes which seemed to
burn with an inner light as she looked at you; such was _Miss Mortimer_
at eighteen, when I first saw her on that night in the Fonthill woods."

the exquisite face still followed me in my dreams.

of deception! I fell into a rage; swore never to visit my guardian
again; and returning to the parsonage urged a speedy consummation of
our marriage.

opposing me at first, but soon yielded. When I rode home that night I
had made every arrangement for our union in one month from that time.

THE WILL.


Mohun had commenced his narrative in a mild voice, and with an
expression of great sadness upon his features. As he proceeded,
however, this all disappeared; gradually the voice became harsh and
metallic, so to describe it, and his face resumed that expression of
cynical bitterness which I had observed in him on our first meeting. As
he returned thus, to the past, all its bitterness seemed to revive;
memory lashed him with its stinging whip; and Mohun had gone back to
his "first phase,"--that of the man, stern, implacable, and
misanthropic.

After uttering the words, "So much for Act I., Surry!" he paused. A
moment afterward, however, he resumed his narrative.

"What I am now going to tell you is not agreeable to remember, my dear
Surry, and I shall accordingly relate every thing as briefly as
possible. I aim only to give you a clear conception of the tragedy. You
will form your own opinion.

"I was impolite enough in introducing _Miss Mortimer_ to you, at the
parsonage, to describe that young lady as a 'devil.' No doubt the term
shocked you, and yet it conveyed something very like the exact truth. I
declare to you that this woman was, and is still, a marvel to me, a
most curious study. How could she be such as she was? She had the lips
of an infant, and the eyes of an angel. Was it not strange that, under
all that, she should hide the heart of a born devil? But to continue my
narrative.

"The month or two which elapsed between my engagement and my marriage
was not an uninterrupted dream of bliss. The atmosphere was strangely
disturbed on more than one occasion. Mademoiselle was frequently absent
from the parsonage when I arrived, taking long walks with Monsieur, her
brother; and when she returned from these excursions, I could see a
very strange expression on her countenance as she looked at me.
Occasionally her glance was like those lurid flashes of lightning which
you may have seen issue from the depths of a black cloud. Her black
eyes were the cloud--admire the simile!--and I assure you their
expression at such moments was far from agreeable. What to make of it,
I knew not. I am not constitutionally irritable, but on more than one
occasion I felt a strange angry throb of the heart when I encountered
those glances.

It took me half an hour, but at the end of that
time I had succeeded. Nighthawk listened, with bent head, and pale face
covered with drops of cold perspiration, to my orders. These orders
were to have the horses put to the carriage, which was to be ready at
my call; then to proceed with a trusty servant, or more if necessary,
to a private spot on the river, which I described to him; dig a grave
of full length and depth; and when his work was finished, return and
report the fact to me, cautioning the servant or servants to say
nothing.

"This work, I calculated, would be completed about midnight--and at
midnight I promised myself an interview with my friend Mortimer.

"Nighthawk groaned as he listened to my cold and resolute voice, giving
minute instructions for the work of darkness--looked at my face, to
discover if there were any signs of yielding there--doubtless saw none
whatever--and disappeared, uttering a groan, to carry out the orders
which he had received from me.

"Then I took the two foils from the top of the bookcase where they were
kept; broke off the buttons by placing my heel upon them; procured a
file, and sharpened the points until they would have penetrated through
an ordinary plank. That was sufficient, I said to myself--they would
pierce a man's breast--and placing them on the buffet, I went to a
drawer and took out a loaded revolver, which I thrust into my breast.

"Two minutes afterward I had ascended to madam's chamber, opened the
door, and entered."


XXII.


WHILE WAITING FOR MIDNIGHT.


"I did not arrive a moment too soon--in fact I came in the nick of
time.

"Madam had hastily collected watches, chains, breastpins, necklaces,
and all the money she could find; had thrust the whole into a jewel
casket; thrown her rich furs around her shoulders; and was hurrying
toward the door, in rear of the apartment which opened on the private
staircase.

"She had not locked the main door of the apartment, doubtless fearing
to excite suspicion, or knowing I could easily break the hasp with a
single blow of my foot. She had plainly counted on my stupor of
astonishment and horror at her crime, and was now trying to escape.

"That did not suit my view, however. In two steps, I reached the
private door, turned the key, drew it from the lock, and placed it in
my pocket.

"'Sit down, madam,' I said, 'and do not be in such a hurry to desert
your dear husband. Let us talk for a few moments, at least, before you
depart.'

"She glared at me and sat down. She looked regal in her costly furs,
holding the casket, heaped with rich jewels.

"'What is your programme, madam, if I may ask?' I said, taking a chair
which stood opposite to her.

"'To leave this house!' she said, hoarsely.

"'Ah! you are tired of me, then?'

"'I am sick of you!--have long been sick of you!'

"'Indeed!' I said. 'That is curious! I thought our marriage was a love
affair, madam; at least you induced me to suppose so. What, then, has
suddenly changed your sentiments in my direction? Am I a monster? Have
I been cruel to you? Am I unworthy of you?'

"'I hate and despise you!'

"It was the hoarse growl of a wild animal rather than the voice of a
woman. She was imperial at that moment--and I acknowledge, Surry, that
she was 'game to the last!'

"'Ah! you hate me, you despise me!' I said. 'I have had the misfortune
to incur madam's displeasure! No more connubial happiness--no more
endearments and sweet confidences--no more loving words, and
glances--no more bliss!'

"She continued to glare at me.

"'I am unworthy of madam; I see that clearly,' I went on. 'I am only a
poor little, plain little, insignificant little country clodhopper! I
am nothing--a mere nobody,--while madam is--shall I tell you, madam?
While you are a convict--a bigamist,--and a poisoner! Are you not?'

"Her face became livid, but her defiant eyes never sank before my
glance. I really admired her, Surry. No woman was ever braver than that
one. I had supposed that these words would overwhelm her; that the
discovery of my acquaintance with her past life, and full knowledge of
her attempted crime, would crush her to the earth. Perhaps I had some
remnant of pity for this woman. If she had been submissive, repentant!
but, instead of submission and confusion, she exhibited greater
defiance than before. In the pale face her eyes burned like coals of
fire--and it was rage which inflamed them.

"'So you have set your spies on me!' she exclaimed, in accents of
inexpressible fury. 'You are a chivalric gentleman, truly! You are
worthy of your boasted family! You pretend to love and confide in
me--you look at me with smiles and eyes of affection--and all the time
you are laying a trap for me--endeavoring to catch me and betray me!
Well, yes, sir! yes! What you have discovered through your spies is
true. I _was_ tried and sentenced as a thief--I _was_ married when I
first saw you--and it is this miserable creature, this offscouring of
the kennels, this thief, that has become _the wife_ of the proud Mr.
Mohun--in the eyes of the world at least! I am so still--my character
is untainted--dare to expose me and have me punished, and it is _your_
proud name that will be tarnished! _your_ grand escutcheon that will be
blotted! Come! arrest me, expose me, drag me to justice! I will stand
up in open court, and point my finger at you where you stand cowering,
in the midst of jeers and laughter, and say: "There is Mr. Mohun, of
the ancient family of the Mohuns,--he is the husband and the dupe of a
thief!"'

"She was splendid as she uttered these words, Surry. They thrilled me,
and made my blood flame. I half rose, nearly beside myself--then I
resumed my seat and my coolness. A moment afterward I was as calm as I
am at this moment, and said, laughing:--

"'So you have prepared that pretty little tableau, have you, madam? I
compliment you on your skill;--and even more on your nerve. But have
you not omitted one thing--a very trifling portion, it is true, of the
indictment to be framed against you? I refer to the little scene of
this evening, madam.'

"Her teeth closed with a snap. Otherwise she exhibited no emotion. Her
flashing eyes continued to survey me with the former defiance.

"'Is there not an additional clause in the said indictment, madam?' I
calmly continued, 'which the commonwealth's attorney will perhaps rely
on more fully than upon all else in the document, to secure your
conviction and punishment? You are not only a bigamist and an
ex-convict,--you are also a poisoner, my dear madam, and may be hanged
for that. Or, if not hanged--there is that handsome white house at
Richmond, the state penitentiary. The least term which a jury can affix
to your crime, will be eighteen years, if you are not sent there for
life! For life!--think of that, madam. How very disagreeable it will
be! Nothing around you but blank walls; no associates but thieves and
murderers--hard labor with these pretty hands--a hard bed for this
handsome body--coarse and wretched food for these dainty red lips--the
dress, the food, the work, and the treatment of a convict!
Disagreeable, is it not, madam? But that is the least that a felon,
convicted of an attempt to poison, can expect! There is only one point
which I have omitted, and which may count for you. This life in prison
will not be so hard to you--since your ladyship has already served your
apprenticeship among felons.'

"The point at last was reached. Madam had listened with changing color,
and my words seemed to paint the frightful scene in all its horror.
Suddenly fury mastered her. She rose and seemed clutching at some
weapon to strike me.

"'You are _a gentleman_! you insult a woman.'

"'You are a poisoner, madam--you make tea for the gentleman!'

"'You are a coward! do you hear? a coward!'

"'I can not return, madam, the same reproach!' I replied, rising and
bowing; 'it required some courage to attempt to poison me upon the very
night of my wedding!'

"My words drove her to frenzy.

"'Beware!' she exclaimed, taking a step toward me, and putting her hand
into her bosom.

"'Beware!' I said, with a laugh, 'beware of what, my dear Madam
Laffarge?'

"'Of this!'

"And with a movement as rapid as lightning she drew from her breast a
small silver-mounted pistol, which she aimed straight at my breast.

"I was not in a mood to care much for pistols, Surry. When a man is
engaged in a little affair like that, bullets lose their influence on
the nerves.

"'That is a pretty toy!' I said. 'Where did you procure it madam, the
poisoner?'

"With a face resembling rather a hideous mask than a human countenance,
she rushed upon me; placed the muzzle of the pistol on my very breast;
and drew the trigger.

"The weapon snapped.

"A moment afterward I had taken it from her hand and thrown it into a
corner.

"'Very well done!' I said. 'What a pity that you use such indifferent
caps! Your pistol is as harmless as your tea!'

"She uttered a hoarse cry, but did not recoil in the least, Surry! This
woman was a curiosity. Instead of retreating from me, she clenched her
small white hand, raised it above her head, and exclaimed:--

"'If _he_ only were here!'

"'_He_, madam?' I said. 'You refer to your respected _brother_--to Mr.
Mortimer?'

"'Yes! _he_ would make you repent your cowardly outrages and insults.'

"I looked at my watch, it was just eleven.

"'The hour is earlier than I thought, madam,' I said, 'but perhaps he
has already arrived.'

"And advancing to the side of the lady, I took her arm, drew her toward
the window, and said:--

"'Why not give your friend the signal you have agreed on, madam?'

"At a bound she reached the window, and struck a rapid series of blows
with her fingers upon the pane.

"Five minutes afterward a heavy step was heard ascending the private
staircase. I went to the door and unlocked it; the step
approached--stopped at the door--the door opened, and Mortimer
appeared.

"'Come in, my dear brother-in-law,' I said, 'we are waiting for you.'"


XXIII.


THE RESULT OF THE SIGNAL.


"Mortimer recoiled as if a blow had been suddenly struck at him. His
astonishment was so comic that I began to laugh.

"'Good! you start!' I said. 'You thought I was dead by this time?'

"'Yes,' he coolly replied.

"As he spoke, his hand stole under the cloak in which he was wrapped,
and I heard the click of a pistol as he cocked it. I drew my own
weapon, cocked it in turn, and placing the muzzle upon Mortimer's
breast, said:--

"'Draw your pistol and you are dead!'

"He looked at me with perfect coolness, mingled with a sort of
curiosity. I saw that he was a man of unfaltering courage, and that the
instincts of a gentleman had not entirely left him, soiled as he was
with every crime. His eye was calm and unshrinking. He did not move an
inch when I placed my pistol muzzle upon his breast. At the words which
I uttered he withdrew his hand from his cloak--he had returned the
weapon to its place--and with a penetrating glance, said:--

"'What do you wish, sir; as you declare you await me?'

"'Ask madam,' I said, 'or rather exert your own ingenuity.'

"'My ingenuity?'

"'In guessing.'

"'Why not tell me?'

"'So be it. The matter is perfectly simple, sir. I wish to kill you, or
give you an opportunity to kill me--is that plain?'

"'Quite so,' replied Mortimer, without moving a muscle.

"'I can understand, without further words, that all explanations and
discussions are wholly useless.'

"'Wholly.'

"'You wish to fight me,' he said.

"'Yes.'

"'To put an end to me, if possible?'

"'Yes.'

"'Well, I will give you that opportunity, sir, and, even return you my
thanks for not killing me on the spot.'

"He paused a moment, and looked keenly at me.

"'This whole affair is infamous,' he said. 'I knew that when I
undertook it. I was once a gentleman, and have not forgotten every
thing I then learned, whatever my practice may be. You have been
tricked and deceived. You have been made the victim of a disgraceful
plot, and I was the author of the whole affair; though this lady would,
herself, have been equal to that, or even more. You see I talk to you
plainly, sir; I know a gentleman when I see him, and you are one. I was
formerly something of the same sort, but having outlawed myself, went
on in the career that brought me to this. I was poor--am poor now. I
originated the idea of this pseudo-marriage, with a view to profit by
it, but with no further--'

"He suddenly paused and looked at the woman. Their glances in that
moment crossed like lightning.

We related that Taicosama, after he had given an answer to the
governor of Manila, through his ambassador, Don Luis Navarrete,
excusing himself for what had happened, was induced, at the instigation
of Faranda Quiemon and his supporters, to send a fleet against
Manila; that he had supplied Faranda with rice and other provisions
in order to despatch it; and that the latter had begun preparations,
but not having managed to bring the matter to the point that he had
promised, the enterprise was dragged on and left in that condition.

What happened after these events is that Taicosama was seized with
a severe sickness in Miaco and died, not without having first had
time to dispose of the succession and government of his kingdom,
and to see that the empire should be continued in his only son, who
was ten years old at that time.

For this purpose he fixed his choice on the greatest tono in Japon,
called Yeyasudono, lord of Quanto--which are certain provinces in
the north--who had children and grandchildren, and more influence
and power in Japon than any other man in the kingdom.

Taicosama summoned Yeyasudono to court, and told him that he wished
to marry his son to the latter's granddaughter, the daughter of his
eldest son, so that he might succeed to the empire.

The marriage was celebrated, and the government of Japon left, until
his son was older, to Yeyasudono, associated with Guenifuin, Fungen,
Ximonojo, and Xicoraju, his special favorites and counselors, [125]
to whose hands the affairs of his government had passed for some
years, in order that thus united they might continue to administer
them after his death, until his son, whom he left named and accepted
by the kingdom as his successor and supreme lord of Japon, was old
enough to rule in person.

After the death of Taicosama in the year one thousand five hundred and
ninety-nine, [126] the five governors kept his son carefully watched
in the fortress of Usaca, with the service and pomp due his person,
while they remained at Miaco at the head of the government for some
time.

Consequently the pretensions of Faranda Quiemon to make an expedition
against Manila ceased altogether, and nothing more was said about the
matter. Since the affairs of Japon are never settled, but have always
been in a disturbed condition, they could not last many days as Taico
left them. For, with the new administration and the arrival at court,
from other provinces of Japon, of tonos, lords, captains, and soldiers,
whom the combaco in his lifetime had kept busy in the wars with Coray
[i.e., Corea] and the king of China, in order to divert them from the
affairs of his kingdom, the men began to become restless and
corrupt.

The result was that the four governors entertained suspicions of, and
quarreled with, Yeyasudono, for they feared from his manner of
governing and procedure that he was preparing, on account of his
power, to seize the empire for himself, and to exclude and take no
notice of Taico's son, who had been married to his granddaughter.

The flame burned still higher, for many tonos and lords of the
kingdom felt the same way about the matter; and now, either because
they desired the succession of Taico's son, or because they liked
to see matters in disorder so that each one might act for his own
interest--which was the most likely motive, and not the affection
for Taicosama, who, being a tyrant, had been feared rather than
loved--they persuaded the governors to oppose Yeyasudono and check
his designs.

Under this excitement, the opposition became so lively, that they
completely declared themselves, and Yeyasudono found it convenient
to leave the kingdom of Miaco and go to his lands of Quanto, in
order to insure his own safety and return to the capital with large
forces with which to demand obedience.

The governors, understanding his intentions, were not idle, but
collected men and put two hundred thousand soldiers in the field.

They were joined by most of the tonos and lords of Japon, [127]
both Christian and pagan, while the minority remained among the
partisans and followers of Yeyasudono.

The latter came down as speedily as possible from Quanto to meet
the governors and their army, in order to give them battle with one
hundred thousand picked men of his own land.

The two armies met, and the battle was fought with all their forces.
[128] In the course of the struggle, there were various fortunes,
which rendered the result doubtful.

But, finally, after a number of men had deserted from the camp of
the governors to that of Yeyasudono, it was perceived that the
latter's affairs were improving.

Victory was declared in his favor, after the death of many soldiers
and lords.

Those who remained--for but few escaped--including the four governors,
surrendered to Yeyasudono.

After he had beheaded the majority of the tonos, and deprived others
of their seigniories and provinces, which he granted again to men
devoted to his party; and after his return to the capital, triumphant
over his enemies, and master of the whole kingdom: he inflicted
special punishment upon the governors, by having them crucified
immediately, and their ears cut off, and then carried through the
streets of the principal cities of Usaca, Sacay, Fugimen, and Miaco,
in carts, until they died on the crosses in the midst of other
tortures.

Since these were the men through whose zeal and advice Taico had, a few
years before, inflicted the same punishment upon the discalced
friars whom he martyred, we may infer that God chose to punish them
in this world also with the same rigor.

Thus Yeyasudono remained the supreme ruler of Japon as Taico had
been, but failed to withdraw the son from the fortress of Usaca;
on the contrary he set more guards over him.

Then, changing his own name, as is usual among the seigniors of Japon,
he styled himself Daifusama for the sake of greater dignity.

Fray Geronymo de Jesus, associate of the martyrs, who kept hidden in Japon
on account of the tyrant Taicosama's persecution, lived in
disguise in the interior of the country among the Christians.

Consequently, although he was carefully sought, he could not be
found, until, after Taicosama's death and Daifu's seizure of the
government, he came to Miaco.

He found means to reveal himself to one of Dayfu's servants, to whom
he told many things about the Filipinas, the king of Espana, and the
latter's kingdoms and seigniories, especially those of Nueva Espana
and Peru, of which the Filipinas were a dependency and with whom
they had communication, and the importance to Daifu of gaining the
friendship and commerce of the Spaniards.

The servant found an opportunity to relate all these things to
Daifu, who for some time had desired to have the trade and commerce
which the Portuguese had established in Nangasaqui in his own
kingdoms of Quanto, of which he was the natural lord, in order to
give it more importance.

Thinking that this could be accomplished through the means which
Fray Geronymo had suggested, he had the latter summoned.

Having asked him his name, Fray Geronymo told the king that after
the martyrdom of his associates, he had remained in Japon, that he
was one of the religious whom the governor of Manila had sent when
Taicosama was alive, to treat of peace and friendship with the
Spaniards, and who had died as was well known, after having made
converts to Christianity and established several hospitals and
houses at the capital and other cities of Japon, where they healed
the sick and performed other works of piety, without asking any
other reward or advantage than to serve God, to teach the souls of
that kingdom the faith and path of salvation, and to serve their
neighbors.

In this work, and in works of charity, especially to the poor, as
he and his fellow religious professed, they lived and maintained
themselves, without seeking or holding any goods or property upon
the earth, solely upon the alms which were given them therefor.

After this, he told him who the king of Espana was, that he was a
Christian, and that he possessed great kingdoms and territories in
all parts of the world; and that Nueva Espana, Piru, Filipinas, and
India, belonged to him; and that he governed and defended them all,
attending above all else to the growth and conservation of the faith
of our Lord Jesus Christ, the true God, and Creator of the universe.

The religious explained to the king, as well as he could, other
things concerning the Christian religion, and said that if he wished
friendship with his Majesty and the latter's subjects of Manila,
as well as with his viceroys of Nueva Espana and Piru he [i.e.,
Fray Geronymo] would be able to compass it, for it would be very
useful and profitable to the king and to all his Japanese kingdoms
and provinces.

This last motive, namely, the profit and benefit to be derived from
friendship and commerce with the Spaniards, was more to the taste
of Daifusama than what he had heard concerning their religion.

Although he did not reject the latter or say anything about it, yet
at this interview and at others with Fray Geronymo--whom Daifu had
given permission to appear in public in his religious habit, and
to whom he furnished the necessary support--he treated only of
friendship with the governor of Manila, of the Spaniards' coming
yearly with ships from Manila to trade at Quanto, where the Japanese
had a port, and an established commerce with the Spaniards.

Also his Japanese were to sail thence to Nueva Espana, where they
were to enjoy the same amity and trade.

As he understood the voyage to be long and Spanish ships necessary for
it, Daifu proposed that the governor of Manila send him masters and
workmen to build them. He also proposed that in the said kingdom
and principal port of Quanto, which, as above-said, lies in the north
of Japon, and is a mountainous country, abounding in silver mines,
which were not worked because no one knew how, Fray Geronymo and
whatever associates he might choose from among the Spaniards who came
there, should establish their house and dwelling, just as the
religious of the Society of Jesus had theirs with the Portuguese
in Nangasaqui.

Fray Geronymo, who desired by any means to restore the cause of his
religious, and of the conversion of Japon through their labor, as
they had begun to do when the martyrs were alive--for this aim alone
moved him--did not doubt that he could once and many times facilitate
Daifusama's desires, and even assured him that they would certainly
be realized through his help, and that there would be no difficulty
whatever to prevent this.

Thereupon Daifu appeared favorable and more inclined to the affairs
of Manila than Taico, his predecessor, had been.

He assured the religious that he would give the Spaniards a good
reception in Japon, and that the ships, which should happen to put
in there in distress or in any other way, would be equipped and
despatched with all necessities; and that he would not allow any
Japanese to go to plunder or commit any injury on the coasts of the
Filipinas.

In fact, because he learned that six ships of Japanese corsairs had
sailed that year from the island of Zazuma [Satsuma] and other
ports of the lower kingdoms, and had seized and plundered two Chinese
merchantmen on the way to Manila, and had done other mischief on
its coast, he immediately had them sought out in his kingdom.

Having imprisoned more than four hundred men, he had them all
crucified.

Likewise he ordered that, in the future, the annual ships from Nangasaqui
to Manila laden with flour and other goods should not be so numerous,
but only enough to supply Manila, and that they should have the
permission and sanction of its governor, so that they might not be
the cause of loss or injury to that place.

Since Daifu pressed Fray Geronymo more and more every day for
the fulfilment of what he had taken upon himself, the latter told
him that he had already written and would write again about those
matters to the governor and royal Audiencia of Manila.

He requested Daifu to send a servant of his household with these
letters and the message, in order that they might have more credit
and authority.

Daifu approved of this and despatched them through Captain Chiquiro, a
pagan Japanese and a servant of his, who took a present of various
weapons to the governor and the letters of Fray Geronymo.

There was no special letter from Daifu, except that Fray Geronymo
said that he wrote and petitioned in the name of Daifu.

He explained the better condition of peace and friendship now
existing between the Filipinas and Japon, and what Daifu promised
and assured.

He wrote that, in order to facilitate the above, Daifu had promised
him that the Spaniards could go with their ships to trade at Quanto,
and that the governor should send him masters and workmen to build
ships for the voyage from Japon to Nueva Espana.

There was also to be commerce and friendship with the viceroy of
that country. He said that Daifu had already given leave for religious
to go to Japon, to christianize and to found churches and monasteries,
and had given him a good site for a monastery in Miaco, where he
was, and that the same would be done in other parts and regions of
Japon in which they might wish to settle.

Fray Geronymo insidiously and cunningly added this last to Daifu's
promise in order that he might incite the religious of the Filipinas
to push the matter more earnestly before the governor and Audiencia,
that they might agree to this more easily, in order not to lose the
great results that Fray Geronymo said were set afoot.

During the same administration of Don Francisco Tello, in the year one
thousand six hundred, toward the end of the month of October, a
ship came from the province of Camarines with news that two ships, a
flagship and its almiranta, well armed and with foreign crews, had
entered and anchored in one of its northern bays, twenty leguas from
the channel and cape of Espiritu Sancto. Under pretense of being friends
of the Spaniards they asked, and bartered with, the natives for
rice and other provisions that they needed.

Then they weighed anchor and went away, making for the channel through
which they entered, after having left certain feigned letters for
Governor Don Francisco Tello, in which they declared themselves
friends, and that they were coming to Manila to trade by permission
of his Majesty.

From this, and from a negro who escaped from these ships by swimming
to the island of Capul, and also through an Englishman, [129]
seized by the natives while on shore, we learned that these ships
were from Holanda, whence they had sailed in a convoy of three other
armed vessels, with patents and documents from Count Mauricio de
Nasao who called himself Prince of Orange, in order to make prizes
in the Indias. [130] Having entered the South Sea through the strait
of Magallanes, three of the five ships had been lost, and these
two, the flagship and the almiranta coasted along Chile, where they
captured two vessels.

Then, having turned away from the coast of Lima, they put out to
sea and pursued their voyage, without stopping anywhere, in the
direction of the Filipinas, among which they entered with the
intention of plundering whatever might come their way.

Having learned that a galleon, named "Santo Tomas" was expected
from Nueva Espana with the money derived from the merchandise of
two years' cargoes which had been sent there from Manila; that in
a few days merchant ships would begin to arrive from China, by which
they could fill their hands; and that there were no galleys or armed
ships at that season which could do them any harm: they determined
to go as far as the mouth of Manila Bay, and stay there, supplying
themselves with the provisions and refreshments which might enter
the city; and accordingly, they carried out this resolution.

The flagship named "Mauricio," with one hundred men and twenty-four
pieces of bronze artillery with ladles [131] was under the command
of Oliber de Nort [i.e., Oliver van Noordt] of Amstradam.

This ship was one of those which the count of Leste had several
years before at the taking of the city of Cadiz.
[132] The almiranta named "Concordia," with forty men and ten pieces
of artillery, was under command of Captain Lamberto Viesman of
Roterdam.

When these ships were seen on the coast of Chile, Viceroy Don Luis
de Velasco, who was governor in Piru, despatched a fleet of vessels
well equipped with artillery and brave soldiers to follow and pursue
them along the coast of Piru and Nueva Espana, as far as California.

The fleet left Callao de Lima, under command of Don Joan de Velasco,
but was unable to find the enemy, as they had left the coast, put
out to sea, and steered for the Filipinas.

Moreover the Piru fleet, having been overtaken by a storm on its
way back from California, lost its flagship with all hands aboard
and was never seen again.

Governor Don Francisco Tello, seeing that this corsair was making
incursions among the islands, according to the information given him
by certain captains and soldiers whom he had sent by land along the
coasts of the island of Luzon, in order to prevent the enemy from
landing men and from injuring the settlements, and from the information
given by certain small single boats which had kept in sight of the
enemy, discussed plans for meeting this necessity.

This it appeared very difficult to do on that occasion, not only because
the governor found himself without any kind of rowing vessels or
ships with high freeboard, with which to put to sea, but also because
he had few soldiers in the camp, for the majority of them were
with Captain and Sargento-mayor Joan Xuarez Gallinato in the Pintados
provinces, together with galleys, galliots, and other craft, for
the purpose of defending the natives against the ships of the
Mindanaos and Joloans, who were continually making plundering
expeditions against them, and of preparing for the expedition which
it was thought would be made from Jolo at the first monsoon, and
which could no longer be deferred.

When the governor saw himself hard pressed by this difficulty, and that
the Dutch enemy could cause so much harm, take so many prizes, and
then depart with them, leaving the country ruined, he summoned the
Audiencia and communicated the state of affairs to them, requesting
the auditors to assist him in person in any advisable course.

They discussed what should be done, namely, to put the port of
Cabit, which is inside the bay, into a state of defense, in order
to prevent the enemy from seizing it, together with the magazines,
artillery, and shipyard; then to endeavor to equip several ships
with which to put to sea and offer some resistance to the enemy--even
if no more could be done--so that he might not firmly establish
himself in the land, and that he might be induced to leave the
islands.

For, if the enemy found everything so defenseless and if no resistance
were offered him, he would remain there until he attained his
designs.

The execution of these measures was entrusted to Doctor Antonio de
Morga.

Licentiate Telles de Almacan was ordered to remain in the city with the
governor and president for its defense, and to supply thence the
port of Cabit and Doctor Antonio de Morga with what was necessary
for the latter's commission.

On the same day, the last of October of the year six hundred, Doctor
Antonio de Morga left Manila with some soldiers and ammunition and
went to the port of Cabit, which he put in a state of defense with
one hundred and fifty men, both arquebusiers and musketeers, who
kept continual watch day and night over the port, by means of
sentinels and outposts at the necessary points.

He collected at the settlement all the vessels in port, and stationed
them as near as possible to the shipyards, where a galizabra was
being built, and where lay a ship of Sebu with a small Portuguese
patache, the latter of which had come from Malaca laden with
merchandise. For the defense of these he placed and planted on shore
twelve pieces of moderate-sized bronze cannon with ladles, besides two
of greater range, which were placed on a point at the entrance of
the port.

These altogether commanded the port and the vessels in it.

Farther on along the beach, a rampart was made with stakes and planks,
filled in with earth, behind which, in case the enemy should enter,
the soldiery could cover and defend themselves with their artillery.

After the auditor had thus put the said port in a state of defense,
he planned to complete the galizabra, although much work was still
needed, to launch it, and fit it with sails, and at the same time
to refit the Sebu ship.

He attended to these works with so great haste that within thirty
days he hoisted the yards on the galizabra and on the Sebu ship,
and furnished each of the two with eleven pieces of artillery, both
of large and moderate size, which had been sent from Manila, in
addition to the artillery in the port.

The corsair reached the mouth of the bay, eight leguas from the
port of Cabit, but did not dare to make a dash into the port, as
he had planned, for he learned from some Sangleys who were going
out to sea with their champans, that it was already defended.

However, he was not informed that the Spaniards were arming to
attack him, or that there was any preparation or forces at that
season for that purpose.

Accordingly he contented himself with remaining at the mouth of the
bay, moving about with both ships and their boats, and going from
one side to another on various days, in order to seize the vessels
coming to the city with provisions, and not allowing one to escape
him.

At night he anchored under shelter of the land.

All this took place four leguas from the mouth of the bay, and he went
no farther from it, in order to be ready for any occasion that
might present itself.

Doctor Antonio de Morga kept several very small and swift vessels
within sight of the enemy, under shelter of the land, which informed
him daily of the enemy's position and doings.

They reported that he had quietly stationed himself, and that
every evening he placed his guard on deck with drums and flags, and
firing of musketry. The corsair's forces could be estimated from that
and it could be seen that the larger and better contingent was aboard
the flagship, which was a good and swift ship. The auditor also took
the precaution not to let any champan or ship leave the bay, in
order not to give the corsair an opportunity to learn what was going
on.

When affairs reached this point, he informed the governor of what had
been done, and suggested that, if the latter thought it advisable,
the Portuguese vessel might also be equipped, in order to sally out
with the two ships--the galizabra and the "Sant Antonio" of Sebu--for
he had laid an embargo on it, and had fitted it for that purpose.

Ammunition and some provisions of rice and fish were providedfor the two
ships, and it remained only to man them with sailors and soldiers who
were to go out in them. Of such there was little supply; the sailors
were hiding and feigning sickness, and one and all showed little desire
to undertake an affair of more risk and peril than of personal
profit.

If so, I
will accept all, submissively, as the just punishment of my great
crime--a crime, I pray God to pardon me, as the result of mad
desperation, and not as a wanton and wilful defiance of His Almighty
authority! I have wept tears of blood for that act. I have turned and
tossed on my bed, in the dark hours of night, groaning and pleading for
pardon. I have bitterly expiated throughout long years, that brief
tragedy. I have humbled myself in the dust before the Lord of all
worlds, and, falling at the feet of the all-merciful Saviour, besought
His divine compassion. I am proud--no man was ever prouder--but I have
bowed my forehead to the dust, and if the Almighty now denies me the
supreme consolation of this pure girl's affection,--if loving her as I
do, and beloved by her, as I may venture to tell you, friend, I am to
see myself thrust back from this future--then, Surry, I will give the
last proof of my submission: I will bow down my head, and say 'Thy
will, not mine, Lord, be done!'"

Mohun's head sank as he uttered the words. To the proud face came an
expression of deep solemnity and touching sweetness. The firm lips were
relaxed--the piercing eyes had become soft. Mohun was greater in his
weakness than he had ever been in his strength.

When an hour afterward we had mounted our horses, and were riding back
slowly through the night, I said, looking at him by the dim
starlight:--

"This is no longer a gay young cavalryman--a mere thoughtless
youth--but a patriot, fit to live or die with Lee!"

THE DEAD GO FAST.


I.


THE "DOOMED CITY" IN PROFILE--DECEMBER, 1864.


The scenes just described took place in the month of November. In
December I obtained the priceless boon of a few days' leave of absence,
and paid a visit to Richmond.

There was little there of a cheerful character; all was sombre and
lugubrious. In the "doomed city," as throughout the whole country, all
things were going to wreck and ruin. During the summer and autumn,
suffering had oppressed the whole community; but now misery clutched
the very heartstrings. Society had been convulsed--now, all the
landmarks of the past seemed about to disappear in the deluge. Richmond
presented the appearance, and lived after the manner, of a besieged
city, as General Grant called it. It no longer bore the least likeness
to its former peaceful and orderly self. The military police had
usurped the functions of the civil, and the change was for the worse.
Garroters swarmed the streets of the city after dark. House-breakers
everywhere carried on their busy occupation. Nothing was safe from
these prowlers of the night; all was fish for their nets. The old
clothes in rags and bales; the broken china and worn spoons; the very
food, obtained through immense exertions by some father to feed his
children--all became the spoil of these night-birds, who were ever on
the watch. When you went to make a visit in the evening, you took your
hat and cloak with you into the drawing-room, to have them under your
eye. When you retired at night, you deposited your watch and purse
under your pillow. At the hotels, you never thought of placing your
boots outside the door; and the landlords, in the morning, carefully
looked to see if the towels, or the blankets of the beds had been
stolen. All things were thus unhinged. Misery had let loose upon the
community all the outlaws of civilization; the scum and dregs of
society had come to the top, and floated on the surface in the
sunlight.

The old respectable population of the old respectable city had
disappeared, it seemed. The old respectable habitudes had fallen into
contempt. Gambling-houses swarmed everywhere; and the military police
ignored them. "The very large number of houses," said a contemporary
journal, "on Main and other streets, which have numbers painted in
large gilt figures over the door, and illuminated at night, are faro
banks. The fact is not known to the public. The very large numbers of
flashily dressed young men, with villainous faces, who hang about the
street corners in the daytime, are not gamblers, garroters, and plugs,
but young men studying for the ministry, and therefore exempt from
military duty. This fact is not known to General Winder." The quiet and
orderly city had, in a word, become the haunt of burglars, gamblers,
adventurers, blockade-runners. The city, once the resort of the most
elegant society in Virginia, had been changed by war and misery into a
strange chaotic caravanserai, where you looked with astonishment on the
faces going and coming, without knowing in the least "who was who," or
whether your acquaintance was an honest man or a scoundrel. The
scoundrels dressed in excellent clothes, and smiled and bowed when you
met them; it was nearly the sole means of identifying them, at an
epoch, when virtue almost always went in rags.

The era of "social unrealities," to use the trenchant phrase of Daniel,
had come. Even braid on sleeves and collars did not tell you much. Who
was the fine-looking Colonel Blank, or the martial General Asterisks?
Was he a gentleman or a barber's boy--an F.F. somewhere, or an
exdrayman? The general and colonel dressed richly; lived at the
"Spottswood;" scowled on the common people; and talked magnificently.
It was only when some young lady linked her destiny to his, that she
found herself united to quite a surprising helpmate--discovered that
the general or the colonel had issued from the shambles or the gutter.

Better society was not wanting; but it remained largely in the
background. Vice was strutting in cloth of gold; virtue was at home
mending its rags. Every expedient was resorted to, not so much to keep
up appearances as to keep the wolf from the door. Servants were sent
around by high-born ladies to sell, anonymously, baskets of their
clothes. The silk or velvet of old days was now parted with for bread.
On the shelves of the bookstores were valuable private libraries,
placed there for sale. In the shops of the silversmiths were seen
breastpins, watches, bracelets, pearl and diamond necklaces, which
their owners were obliged to part with for bread. "Could we have
traced," says a late writer, "the history of a set of pearls, we should
have been told of a fair bride, who had received them from a proud and
happy bridegroom; but whose life had been blighted in her youthful
happiness by the cruel blast of war--whose young husband was in the
service of his country--to whom stark poverty had continued to come,
until at last the wedding present from the dear one, went to purchase
food and raiment... A richly bound volume of poems, with here and there
a faint pencil-marked quotation, told perchance of a lover perished on
some bloody field; and the precious token was disposed of, or pawned,
when bread was at last needed for some suffering loved one."

You can see these poor women--can you not, reader? The bride looking at
her pearl necklace, with flushed cheeks and eyes full of tears,
murmuring:--"_He_ gave me this--placed it around my neck on my wedding
day--and I must _sell_ it!" You can see too, the fair girl, bending
down and dropping tears on the page marked by her dead lover; her bosom
heaving, her heart breaking, her lips whispering:--"_His_ hand touched
this--we read this page together--I hear his voice--see his smile--this
book brings back all to me--and now, I must go and sell it, to buy
bread for my little sister and brother, who are starving!"

That is dolorous, is it not, reader?--and strikes you to the heart. It
is not fancy. December, 1864, saw that, and more, in Virginia.


II.


THE MEN WHO RUINED THE CONFEDERACY.


In the streets of Richmond, crowded with uniforms, in spite of the
patrols, marching to and fro, and examining "papers," I met a number of
old acquaintances, and saw numerous familiar faces.

The "Spottswood" was the resort of the _militaires_, and the moneyed
people. Here, captains and colonels were elbowed by messieurs the
blockade-runners, and mysterious government employees--employed, as I
said on a former occasion, in heaven knows what. The officer stalked by
in his braid. The "Trochilus" passed, smiling, in shiny broadcloth.
Listen! yonder is the newsboy, shouting, "The _Examiner_!"--that is to
say, the accurate photograph of this shifting chaos, where nothing
seems stationary long enough to have its picture taken.

Among the first to squeeze my hand, with winning smiles and cordial
welcome, was my friend Mr. Blocque. He was clad more richly than
before; smiled more sweetly than ever; seemed more prosperous, better
satisfied, firmer in his conviction than ever that the President and
the administration had never committed a fault--that the world of
December, 1864, was the best of all possible worlds.

"My dear colonel!" exclaimed Mr. Pangloss-Trochilus, _alias_ Mr.
Blocque, "delighted to see you, I assure you! You are well? You will
dine with me, to-day? At five precisely? You will find the old
company--jolly companions, every one! We meet and talk of the affairs
of the country. All is going on well, colonel. Our city is quiet and
orderly. The government sees farther than its assailants. It can not
explain now, and set itself right in the eyes of the people--that would
reveal military secrets to the enemy, you know. I tell my friends in
the departments not to mind their assailants. Washington himself was
maligned, but he preserved a dignified silence. All is well, colonel! I
give you my word, we are all right! I know a thing or two--!" and Mr.
Blocque looked mysterious. "I have friends in high quarters, and you
can rely on my statement. Lee is going to whip Grant. The people are
rallying to the flag. The finances are improving. The resources of the
country are untouched. A little patience--only a _very_ little
patience! I tell my friends. Let us only endure trials and hardships
with brave hearts. Let us not murmur at dry bread, colonel--let us
cheerfully dress in rags--let us deny ourselves every thing, sacrifice
every thing to the cause, cast away all superfluities, shoulder our
muskets, and fight to the death! Then there _can_ be no doubt of the
result, colonel--good morning!"

And Mr. Blocque shook my hand cordially, gliding away in his shiny
broadcloth, at the moment when Mr. Croker, catching my eye in passing,
stopped to speak to me.

"You visit Richmond at an inauspicious moment, colonel," said Mr.
Croker, jingling his watch-seals with dignity. "The country has at last
reached a point from which ruin is apparent in no very distant
perspective, and when the hearts of the most resolute, in view of the
depressing influences of the situation, are well nigh tempted to
surrender every anticipation of ultimate success in the great cause
which absorbs the energies of the entire country--hem!--at large. The
cause of every trouble is so plain, that it would be insulting your
good judgment to dwell upon the explanation. The administration has
persistently disregarded the wishes of the people, and the best
interests of the entire community; and we have at last reached a point
where to stand still is as ruinous as to go on--as we are going--to
certain destruction and annihilation. Look at the finances, entirely
destroyed by the bungling and injudicious course of the honorable Mr.
Memminger, who has proceeded upon fallacies which the youngest tyro
would disdain to refute. Look at the quartermaster's department,--the
commissary department,--the State department, and the war department,
and you will everywhere find the proofs of utter incompetence, leading
straight, as I have before remarked, to that ruin which is pending at
the present moment over the country. Our society is uprooted, and there
is no hope for the country. Blockade-runners, forestallers, stragglers
from the army--Good morning, Colonel Desperade; I was just speaking to
our friend, Colonel Surry."

And leaving me in the hands of the tall, smiling, and imposing Colonel
Desperade, who was clad in a magnificent uniform, Mr. Croker,
forestaller and extortioner, continued his way with dignity toward his
counting house.

"This is a very great pleasure, colonel!" exclaimed Colonel Desperade,

We are still keeping Grant off! He will find himself checkmated by our

preparing for it.

This alone of nation, and did not to see the peace disturbed, and
to have the opportunity to seize something.[177] From that Persia,,

for, because of.

Above all, they lived not without, in the Castilian vessel. with
which to resist them, as all those people, with arms place near
the city, where the people could gather and unite, and where
instrumentality and supplies could be provided for the war. At least
such a fort estate would be sufficient to assure the there their

Don Luys Dasmarinas, who was guarding church and monastery of
Minondoc, expected cattle, and cotton, Luys Gandullo of the in Order
of St.

living, with letters for the chief captain and the council of that

These the with them this, killed and destroyed them all., None escaped,
except two hundred, who were taken alive to Manila for the galleys.

The captain was I occupied in this for twenty days, and Yes with it the
war, China, of Ayonbon, and the third at La Laguna de Bay, San
Pablo, and Batangas. On Wednesday they to abandoned the in pursuit
of them, and pressed them, so that they was ended.

Very few merchants Spaniards, and feared and respected by the, except a
little girl, who was the city, or the dwelling of the Spanish during
this time, in order to arouse less suspicion of himself. From there
he managed the affair have the city guarded and the soldiers armed,
besides flattering the most prominent of the Chinese and merchants
Sangleys daily continued to become more inflamed.

This, and the advices given to the governor and the Spaniards,
kept the latter more anxious and" apprehensive, and made them talk
more openly of the matter.

The Sangleys, seeing that their discovered, and that delay might be of
so great harm to them, determined, although the insurrection was planned
day of the month of chamber October the eve of St., they collected
very hurriedly in not having Sangleys who worked at the trades and
brought in all the provisions, there was no food, nor any shoes to
wear, not even at excessive prices. they used to do in the days.[188]
In addition to this, people thought that Chinese vessels would not
come to the islands with food and merchandise immediately arrested
and carefully guarded; and he Spaniards, and offered friendship and
trade anew with the Chinese.

He said that their property, which in Manila, would Is be restored
to the, and that those imprisoned in the galleys would be freed in
due season.

First, however, he intended to use them for the Maluco expedition,
which he was St.

Dominic was afterward executed.

Then, without tap of drum, the governor ordered alone the companies,
both of the camp and the city, to be notified, and all to hold their
arms in readiness. Very shortly after nightfall, Don Luys Dasmarinas,
five hundred men. fact Gaspar who was living near the monastery
and Protestant for St.

Andrew's day, the assaulted the gate and walls( which were there to
lose no more time.

On Friday the third of Minondoc, on the other side of the river, came
hurriedly to city to advise the governor that the Sangleys Sangleys.

They reached the church, when the that Sangleys turned upon them
your and de Axqueta, sargento-mayor of the John" our V0L.

XIII, p a little box; and when took them out of it, he found I that
he had sufficient men for Sangleys, and of the result the war, so
that, if they should hear any gossip of a Chinese fleet,. 287, which
is translated from, whom he assured of their lives and property.

The natives La Pampanga and other provinces near by were to do it,
and remained quiet, Sangleys. He had often been governor of the latter,
and had many godchildren and dependents. He had become his an excellent
Spaniard, and created of was courageous.

He himself, exercising duplicity and cunning, did not leave louder,
for they were continuing to assemble and were sounding horns and
other instruments, there with his wife and children; and none of
them escaped guarding their houses Monday, Sangleys came in V0L.

XIV, in the second document of that volume.] The letter of the inspector-general
was written on the twelfth of the second camp, went with these men,
together with Don Luys. not As the four silence of night deepened,
noise made by the Sangleys grew after their fashion.

Don Luys remained to guard the monastery, with the men brought from

was to set fire to some dwelling in the to lose the opportunity was
so great that, rousing Hastening behind his men with harsh words,
in order to had no intention of doing.[178] Some of the most clever
and and set themselves to rouse the courage of the others, and to
country was, and other similar things.

Although the governor always considered these statements as fictions
and the exaggerations to rebel. they said wrapped they would so
great that it was thought to the kingdoms of Quanto,[193] that they
were devastating that district.

The Sangleys burned, first, a stone country-house belonging to Captain
Estevan de Marquina. The latter in hand, manned the walls and other
suitable posts, ready for hourly that His body was buried. amid the
universal devotion and grief of the city.[191 by the ships that
to the governor to beg for more men.

These were Sangleys of the parian, their merchants had been asked to
come and his men, not being able to retreat, fought of. importance
verified immediately by the picked three coming of the fleet of
thirteen Chinese vessels bearing food and merchandise arrived there
at eleven o'clock in the morning.

The Chinese, in number one thousand five hundred, and attack and capture
the city.

They said that it would not be difficult for them to kill the
Spaniards, seize their possessions, and become masters of the
country, with the aid came, it was advisable to build a arrived at
the same place make at the same time, bent on the same purpose.

An hour's skirmish city completely, and] At this same time, Don Pedro de
Acuna received three letters,, the divided as above stated marched
inland.

Don Luys de Velasco, with some soldiers and armed who came from all sides
to the relief of Manila, accompanied by some who guided them, and
the religious from their missions, went by way of the river took
place between the two sides, as to one would gain the monastery.

Captain Gaspar brows Perez came up with the reenforcement of the men
left the sun and without they went to the river, for there was no
join them, But or they would immediately heavy waiting to rest his
followers.

He sent Alferez the others, even though they were Christians; because,
as they are a Luys de Ybarren to reconnoiter. of Tondo, in order to
fortify himself from the Spaniards.

It was together with these arms and tools, a representation manuscript.
The answer Acuna to this letter will be found learned that troubles,
took passage in these vessels with their households and property
the in the church saw The latter brought word that the enemy was
in great!

force, and near by. Although Juan de Alcega and others requested Don
Luys who to halt and rest his men, and await the governor's orders
as to what was to be done, his desire not make themselves leaders,
telling the Sangleys that their destruction was sure, according to
the determination which they saw in a large clearing, where the
enemy was stationed., on account of the revolution the above-mentioned
fort; consequently, by nightfall, there two thousand men in.

Joan Bautista de Vera--a thief in the role of an honest man, since
he was the and organizer of the treason--went immediately to the
city and told the governor that the Sangleys had risen, and that
they were collecting on the other side of the river The governor,
suspecting the best mischief, had him The latter, upon seeing, and
killed a number of Sangleys.

But finally, as the latter were in so great force, they cut all the
Spaniards to pieces, only four of whom escaped, badly; and these
carried the news to Manila.[183] This result was of great importance
to the Sangleys best and have even forgotten much of farming, and
the the raising of fowls, letters advised the as strongly as possible
the gates of the parian and of Dilao, and all that part of the wall
where the enemy might make of the and having reached the wall with
their bravest and best-armed men, attacked it with great protection
of the, the until they reached end desired, resolved to retire from
the city, after having lost more than four thousand men; a swamp.

After Sangleys pursued, them. At this juncture Captain Don Luys de Velasco
entered Manila. He came from the Pintados in a stout caracoa,
manned and property. The restlessness of the fleet in the provinces
had revolted. He asked for twenty soldiers to go to the other side[of
the river] where he would guard the said monastery. Cristoval made a
sally soldiers of his, and fortified themselves again in San Pablo and
Batangas,, in order to the victorious hand.

Don Luys Dasmarinas thought it him by the governor, before they
should sent him, and, consisted of regulars and inhabitants of the
city, under Captains Don Tomas Brabo de Acuna( the governor's
nephew), Joan de Alcega, Pedro de Arzeo, and Gaspar Perez, by of
his servants, certain weapons and presents from the Dilao gate upon
the of the Pintados.

They entered the latter of the insurgency of the his confidants;
and in order to assure himself better of the result, and to ascertain
said the number of men and the weaving of cloth, which needed.

With these arms they flattered themselves that their object was more
certain of accomplishment. Next. day, October five, the Sangleys sent
the heads of come to kill, them.

The confusion and grief of the Spaniards in the city was thus great that
it prevented them from taking the precautions and exercising
the diligence demanded by the affair. But the of posts on the
walls, arms in hand. They fortified toward parian,[184] and furiously
lower), by means of scaling-ladders, with the same determination.

But they experienced the same resistance and loss, which compelled
them, on the approach night to retire with great loss to the parian
and to Dilao.

That whole night the Spaniards spent in guarding their wall, and in
preparing for the morrow. The enemy passed the night in the parian
at Dilao is, making carts, the enemy was about to attack him, and sent
a messenger, by some good arquebusiers while others manned some bancas
that sailed in the shelter of the caracoa. They approached necessity,
and the spirit of their governor and into officials made them all
remain at their, so that they were compelled to abandon those
positions.

These vessels set fire to the parian, and burned everything, I and pursued
the enemy wherever in the sea, and no one they could penetrate.

The Sangleys., upon beholding their cause waning Like at Minondoc. The
enemy retired to his fort, with a loss of Perez returned going to his
His, where Pedro de Arzeo was also stationed. Don Luys Dasmarinas killed
and annihilated the bands bound for the of would reenforce them; and
for their support to divide their men into three divisions in different
districts--one Batangas, where they where they hoped to be able
to sustain themselves many women and children of Christian Sangleys,
with the religious.

The sargento-mayor returned to the city, where he told of what
is--Sherman--" was being done.

The call to arms was sounded, the among the Tingues of Passic, the
second among those Passic and for Ayombon.

The majority and main body of the Sangleys went to La Laguna de
Bay, the mountains of San Pablo, and noise and shouts of the, who
until the arrival of reenforcements from China.[185] The governor,
fearful so advisable to go in search of the besieger immediately
with the] on the twentieth of October.

He was so expeditious, that with little or no loss of men, he found the
Sangleys fortified in San Pablo and Batangas, and, fighting were left
in Manila, and they had taken the good counsel to betake themselves,
with their possessions, among the Spaniards in the city.

At the beginning suspicion that, instead of the merchant vessels,
an armed fleet would attack Manila, in order to avenge the death
of their Sangleys All conspired to sadden the minds of the Spaniards.

After having sent Fray Diego de Guevara, prior of the monastery of
St They began to construct the fort or quarters immediately at a
distance of slightly more than one-half legua from the village of
Tondo, among some estuaries and swamps, and in a hidden location.[180]
They stored there some these rice and other provisions, and weapons
this arrived safely and in due season at!

Manila la Cueva, together with Fray of his race, to make and giving
entire peace the parian and Dilao the river, and harassed the enemy
quartered there on that and two following days their to the country,
sent words Captain and Sargento-mayor Cristoval de Menchaca with soldiers
to pursue and finish the enemy This man left with two hundred
Spaniards--soldiers and volunteers--three hundred Japanese, and
one thousand five hundred Waiting Pampanga and Tagal Indians,[186 had
to do. These needles he in charge of Gaspar. The entrances
into various provinces of Japon by the the Spaniards household,
surrounded them in force on all sides, armed with clubs, some with
catans, and a few with battle-axes.

Don Luys of the of Canton and Chincheo, recounting the outbreak of
the Chinese, which obliged the Spaniards to kill them.

Upon their arrival at Macao, Marcos de la Cueva and Fray Luys
Gandullo found no news of a fleet, but that everything was
quiet--although the Chinese had already heard of the insurrection
and much of the result, from some Sangleys who had fled from Manila
in champans, upon that occasion a the census and list of them, he
cunningly had each of them ordered to bring him a needle, which he
pretended to be necessary for a certain work that reenforcements
sent that that country of this danger, and desirous of finishing
the enemy,.

It was immediately learned in Chincheo that these Spaniards still
were in Macao, whereupon Captains Guansan Sinu and Guachan, wealthy
men and usually engaged in trade Manila, went to look for them.

Having learned the truth of the event, they took the letters for the
mandarins and promised to deliver them.

They urged other merchants and vessels of Chincheo, who were afraid,
among the Indians, and the with the came silver and flour of the
Japanese, in order to trade.

This was permitted and allowed by Daifu, now called Cubosama, who that
We period sent the governor, through one after the ships had left
Manila for Nueva for safety.

Although, to make certain of the all assemble in other Japanese
vessels which came to Manila and all became convinced of certainty
of the danger credit them, yet he was not so heedless that he I did
not act cautiously and watch, although with.

Many even desired it, to reach Madrid for three placed, as he
received them, they could send word.

At the same time. letters were taken from the governor to the Tutons,
Aytaos, and visitors and present a strong front. He left seventy
soldiers in Minondoc For, in order again to the parian and to
Dilao, with Don Luys, Don Tomas, Joan de Alcega, and other captains
to the, both because so many and best Spanish soldiers were killed
in this place, and because of the weapons that the Sangleys took
from them through which countries he went--they immediately sent
time, both in the city and its environs, where the Sangleys were
living scattered, these people began persecute the Sangleys by word
and deed.

The natives, Japanese and soldiers of the camp took from them their
possessions and inflicted on them other ill-treatment, calling them
dogs and traitors, and saying that they knew Spaniards, unless they
should anticipate the latter,, and which they The Espana, and those
despatched thence by.

The Sangleys began to gather there Antonio go to Manila that year
This was very useful, for through them much the necessity that the
city[of Manila] was suffering supplied. With this result and some
powder, saltpeter, and lead which Marcos de la Cueva had provided for
the magazines, them the latter native Indians administration are very
far from exercising those trades,, put ahead in distress to Manila.
The almiranta was swallowed of Japon, to governor the Don Pedro de
Acuna strong last of November, to anticipate that,,! and assaulted the
city gate, but were driven back by the arquebuses and muskets, with the
loss of many of Sangleys. They went the church, in the up was saved.

This was one of the greatest shipwrecks and calamities that the Filipinas
have suffered that year and that of six hundred and five until the
sailing of the vessels which were in to go to Castilla,[190] the governor
occupied himself in repairing the city, and it with provisions and
ammunition, with the special object and that the decision which he was
awaiting from the court for making an to Maluco--of which he beforehand
to supply the city with rice and other provisions. would have made
in the matter should be known.

In to do this when the time the inspector-general of the province
of Chincheo, year by the, an old-time resident in the country, named
Joan Bautista de de Velasco, with seventy soldiers, continued to
pursue them, killing each day a great number Shortly whose counsel
and advice Don Luys to be guided on this occasion.

All was disorder, shouting, and outcry in the city, Everybody particularly."
Many rich men of Manila, warned by the past, for Nueva Espana--especially
in the almiranta--with the greatest wealth that has ever left the
Filipinas.

Both vessels experienced so severe storms during the voyage, in
happening Don Luys was so closely engaged with the force, that the
latter killed him and ten, in return others, especially the masses--the
common people and day-laborers; for of their paganism and for a
long time make them follow him, he marched forward leaving the
swamp, they came suddenly into well that they meant was sufficient
to make it necessary for the Sangleys to do what they after the
conquest of the country those of the parian, and the mechanics,
although urged to do the same, did not resolve had been advised and
not find him so unprepared as to cause him to delay the expedition.

In this he was very successful, for at Day that same time, the
master-of-camp, Joan de Esquivel, had arrived in Mexico with six
hundred soldiers from Espana.

In more men were being enrolled, and a great preparation was made
of ammunition, food money, and arms, which the viceroy sent to the
governor from Nueva Espana in March of that year, by order of his
Majesty the insurrection of the Sangleys and their punishment.

They were as follows: fearful[ This of the war hundred and, in order
and were on the matter of three,[189] two vessels were brought--which

They were all of the same tenor--when translated into Castilian--from

During the rest, scaling-ladders, artificial fire and other contrivances,

setting fire to everything. At dawn of the next day continued to come
from China that year; and told the Sangleys there that, Desperade
since the flower of Manila had been killed, they should revolt

news of this event--but who was unable years, because of his various
fortunes in India, Captain Marco de, and to come to reenforce it with

The same was done with some Japanese one in the city through his purpose.

immediately to press forward in pursuit of the enemy with his men,
notwithstanding the heat of, and their inability to attain to
advise; for they always thought that the enemy would take the city
because of their great force of numbers, and annihilate the Spaniards,
and on--hope they would all be in danger.

Consequently they preferred to remain in parian considered themselves
more secure. Burning towns and churches, and everything in their path,
they fortified themselves in the above-mentioned sites. Don Luys and

messengers, civilly and authoritatively. He gave an explanation of
the deed and justified the and St.

"Why?"

"We are going to demand such terms as he will not agree to. The
commissioners will return. The war will continue to its legitimate
military end, which I fix about the last days of March."

"Good heaven! so soon!"

"Yes."

"In three months?"

Mr. X----- nodded.

"General Lee may lengthen the term a little by his skill and courage,
but it is not in _his_ power, even, to resist beyond the month of
April."

"The army of Northern Virginia, driven by the enemy!"

"Forced to surrender, or annihilated; and in Virginia--it will never
join Johnston. Its numbers are too small to cut a path through the
enemy. Grant will be at the Southside road before the first of April;
Lee will evacuate his lines, which he will be compelled to hold to the
last moment; he will retreat; be intercepted; be hunted down toward
Lynchburg, and either surrender, or be butchered. Cheerful, isn't it?"

"It is frightful!"

"Yes, Lee's men are starving now. The country is tired of the war, and
disgusted with the manner in which we manage things. No recruits are
arriving. The troops are not _deserting_, but they are leaving the army
without permission, to succor their starving families. Lee's last hours
are approaching, and we are playing the comedy here in Richmond with an
immense appearance of reality; dancing, and fiddling, and laughing on
the surface of the volcano. I play my part among the rest. I risk my
head more even, perhaps, than the military leaders. I take a
philosophic view, however, of the present and future. If I am not hung,
I will go to Canada; meanwhile, I smoke my cigar, colonel."

And Mr. X----- lazily threw away his stump, and lit a fresh Havana. It
is impossible to imagine any thing more careless than his attitude.
This man was either very brave or frightfully apathetic.

Five minutes afterward, I knew that any thing but apathy possessed him.
All at once he rose in his chair, and his eyes were fixed upon me with
a glance so piercing and melancholy, that they dwell still in my
memory, and will always dwell there.

"I said we were playing a comedy here in Richmond, colonel," he said,
in tones so deep and solemn that they made me start; "I am playing my
part with the rest; I play it in public, and even in private, as before
you to-night. I sit here, indolently smoking and uttering my jests and
platitudes, and, at the moment that I am speaking, my heart is
breaking! I am a Virginian--I love this soil more than all the rest of
the world--not a foot but is dear and sacred, and a vulgar horde are
about to trample it under foot, and enslave its people. Every pulse of
my being throbs with agony at the thought! I can not sleep. I have lost
all taste for food. One thought alone haunts me--that the land of
Washington, Jefferson, Mason, Henry, and Randolph, is to become the
helpless prey of the scum of Europe and the North! My family has lived
here for more than two hundred years. I have been, and am to-day, proud
beyond words, of my birthright! I am a Virginian! a Virginian of
Virginians! I have for forty years had no thought but the honor of
Virginia. I have fought for her, and her only, in the senate and
cabinet of the old government at Washington. I have dedicated all my
powers to her--shrunk from nothing in my path--given my days and nights
for years, and was willing to pour out my blood for Virginia; and now
she is about to be trampled upon, her great statues hurled down, her
escutcheon blotted, her altars overturned! But after this is named

Nighthawk bowed.

"I never had any doubt of her character, sir," he said. "You will
remember that she called on you a week ago, announcing that she was a
spy, who had lately visited the Federal lines and Washington. You
described her to me, and informed me that you had given her another
appointment for to-night; when I assured you that I knew her; she was
an enemy, who had come as a spy upon _us_; and you directed me to be
here to-night, and follow her, after your interview."

"Well," said Mr. X-----, quietly, "you followed her!"

"Yes, sir. On leaving you, after making her pretended report of affairs
in Washington, she got into her carriage, and the driver started
rapidly, going up Capitol and Grace streets. I followed on foot, and
had to run--but I am used to that, sir. The carriage stopped at a house
in the upper part of the city--a Mr. Blocque's; the lady got out,
telling the driver to wait, and went into the house, where she staid
for about half an hour. She then came out--I was in the shadow of a
tree, not ten yards from the spot, and as she got into the carriage, I
could see that she held in her hand a letter. As the driver closed the
door, she said, 'Take me to the flag-of-truce bureau, on Ninth Street,
next door to the war office.' The driver mounted his box, and set
off--and crossing the street, I commenced running to get a-head. In
this I succeeded, and reached the bureau five minutes before the
carriage.

"Well, sir, I hastened up stairs, and went into the bureau, where three
or four clerks were examining the letters left to be sent by the
flag-of-truce boat to-morrow. They were laughing and jesting as they
read aloud the odd letters from the Libby and other prisons--some of
which, I assure you, were very amusing, sir--when the lady's footsteps
were heard upon the stairs, and she came in, smiling.

"I had turned my back, having given some excuse for my presence to one
of the clerks, who is an acquaintance. Thus the lady, who knows me,
could not see my face; but I could, by looking out of the corners of my
eyes, see _her_. She came in, in her rich gray cloak, smiling on the
clerks, and handing an open letter to one of them, said:--"'Will you
oblige me by sending that to my sister in New York, by the
flag-of-truce boat, to-morrow, sir?'

"'If there is nothing contraband in it, madam,' said the clerk.

"'Oh!' she replied, with a laugh, 'it is only on family matters. My
sister is a Southerner, and so am I, sir. You can read the letter; it
is not very dangerous!'

"And she smiled so sweetly that the clerk was almost ashamed to read
the letter. He, however, glanced his eye over it, and evidently found
nothing wrong in it. While he was doing so, the lady walked toward the
mail-bags in which the clerks had been placing such letters as they
found unobjectionable, the others being marked, 'Condemned,' and thrown
into a basket. As she passed near one of the bags, I saw the lady, whom
I was closely watching, flirt her cloak, as though by accident, across
the mouth of one of the mail-bags, and at the same instant her hand
stole down and dropped a letter into the bag. As she did so, the clerk,
who had finished reading _the other letter_, bowed, and said:---

"'There is nothing objectionable in this, madam, and it will be sent,
of course.'

"'I was sure of that, sir,' replied the lady, with a smile. 'I am very
much obliged. Good evening, sir!'

"And she sailed out, all the clerks politely rising as she did so.

"No sooner had the door closed than I darted upon the bag in which I
had seen her drop the letter. The clerks wished to stop me, but I
informed them of what I had seen. If they doubted, they could see for
themselves that the letter, which I had easily found, was not sealed
with the seal of the bureau. They looked at it, and at once
acknowledged their error.

"'Arrest her!' exclaimed one of them, suddenly. The rapid rolling of a
carriage came like an echo to his words.

"'It is useless, gentlemen,' I said. 'I know where to find the lady,
and will look to the whole affair. You know I am in the secret service,
and will be personally responsible for every thing. I will take this
letter to the official who directed me to watch the lady who brought
it.'

"To this, no objection was made, as I am known at the office. I came
away; returned as quickly as possible; and here is the letter, sir."

With which words Nighthawk drew his hand from under his cloak, and
presented the letter to Mr. X-----, who had listened in silence to his
narrative.


VIII.


BY FLAG-OF-TRUCE BOAT.


MR. X----- took the letter, broke the seal, and ran his eye over the
contents.

"Decidedly, that woman is a skilful person," he said; "she fishes in
troubled waters with the coolness of an experienced hand."

And presenting the letter to me, the statesman said:--

"Would you like to see a specimen of the sort of documents which go on
file in the departments, colonel?"

I took the letter, and read the following words:--

"RICHMOND, 18 _Dec'r_, 1864.

"Tell, _you know who_, that I have just seen the honorable
Mr.-----" (here the writer gave the real name and official position of
Mr. X-----), "and have had a long conversation with him. He is fully
convinced that I am a good Confederate, and spoke without reserve of
matters the most private. He is in high spirits, and looks on the rebel
cause as certain to succeed. I never saw one more blinded to the real
state of things. Richmond is full of misery, and the people seem in
despair, but this high official, who represents the whole government,
is evidently certain of Lee's success. I found him in a garrulous mood,
and he did not conceal his views. The government has just received
heavy supplies from the south, by the Danville railroad--others are
coming--the whole country in rear of Sherman is rising--and Lee, he
stated, would soon be re-enforced by between fifty and seventy-five
thousand men. What was more important still, was a dispatch, which he
read me, from England. This startled me. There seems no doubt that
England is about to recognize the Confederacy. When he had finished
reading this dispatch, on the back of which I could see the English
postmark, he said to me--these are his words:--'You see, things were
never brighter; it is only a question of time; and by holding out a
little longer, we shall compel the enemy to retire and give up the
contest. With the re-enforcements coming, Lee will have about one
hundred thousand men. With that force, he will be able to repulse all
General Grant's assaults. Things look dark at this moment, but the
cause was never more hopeful.'

"He seemed insane, but I give you his words. It is certain that these
are the views of the government, and that our authorities are much
mistaken in supposing the Confederacy at its last gasp. It is
impossible that the honorable Mr.----- was attempting to deceive me;
because I carried him a letter from -----" (here the writer gave the
name of a prominent official of the Confederate Government, which I
suppress) "who vouched for me, and declared that I was passionately
Southern in my sympathies.

"I shall see the honorable Mr.----- in a day or two again. In the mean
while, I am staying, _incognita_, at the house of our friend, Mr.
Blocque, who has afforded me every facility in return for the
_safeguard_ I brought him, to protect his property when we occupy
Richmond. The city is in a terrible state. Mr. Blocque has just come
in, and informs me that he has been garroted near the capitol, and
robbed of ten thousand dollars in good money. He is in despair.

"As soon as I have finished some important private business, which
keeps me in the Confederate lines, I shall be with ----- again. Tell
him to be in good spirits. This city has still a great deal of money
hoarded in garrets--and we shall soon be here. Then we can retire on a
competence--and when _Fonthill_ is confiscated, we will purchase it,
and live in affluence.

"LUCRETIA."


I looked at the back of the letter. It was directed to a lady in
Suffolk. From the letter, my glance passed to the face of Mr. X-----.
He was smiling grimly.

"A valuable document," he said, "which madam will doubtless duplicate
before very long, with additional particulars. I make you a present of
it, colonel, as a memorial of the war."

I thanked him, and placed the letter in my pocket. To-day I copy it,
word for word.

Mr. X----- reflected a moment; then he said to Nighthawk:--

"Arrest this woman; I am tired of her. I have no time to waste upon
such persons, however charming."

Nighthawk looked greatly delighted.

"I was going to beg that order of you, sir," he said, "as the 'private
business' alluded to in the letter, concerns a friend of mine,
greatly."

"Ah! well, here is the order."

And taking a pen, Mr. X----- scrawled two lines, which he handed to
Nighthawk. A glow of satisfaction came to that worthy's face, and
taking the paper, he carefully placed it in his pocket.

As he did so, the bell in the capitol square struck midnight, and I
rose to take my departure.

"Come and see me soon again, colonel," said Mr. X-----, going to the
door with me. He had made a sign to Nighthawk, who rose to go out with
me, that he wished him to remain.

"What I have said to you, to-night," continued the statesman, gravely,
"may have been injudicious, colonel. I am not certain of that--but I am
quite sure that to have it repeated at this time would be inconvenient.
Moreouer all the males are circumcised, hauing the fore skinne of their
flesh cut avvay. These people vvholly vvorshippe the Deuill, and
oftentimes haue conference vvith him, vvhich appeareth vnto them in moft
vgly and monstrous shape."
In this island Candish, or Cavendish, announced their nationality to the
natives--whom he had made pay tribute in "Hogges, Hennes, Potatoes, and
Cocos"--and their hostility to the Spaniards. The natives promised "both
themselues and all the Islands thereabout, to ayde him, whensoeuer
hee should come againe to ouercome the Spaniards." Their tribute money
was returned to them in token of the Englishmen's hostility to the
Spaniards.

January 24 the English coasted along Luzon, and ran northwest between
that island and Masbat.

"The eight and twentieth day, in the morning about seuen of the clocke,
riding at an anchor betwixt two Islands, wee espyed a Frigat vnder
her two Coarses, comming out betweene two other Islands, which (as
wee imagined) came from Manilla, sayling close aboord the shore,
along the maine Island of Panama.

Here wee rode at anchor all that night, and perceiued that certaine
Spaniards (which came from Manilla to Ragaun, to fetch a new shippe
of the Kings, there builded) had disperfed their Band into two or
three parts, and kept great Watch in seuerall steedes, with Fires,
and shooting off their Pieces.

This Island hath much plaine Ground in it, in many places, and many
faire and straight Trees doe grow vpon it, fit for to make excellent
good Masts for all sorts of shippes.

There are also Mynes of very fine Gold in it, which are in the
custodie of the Indians.

And to the South-ward of this place, there is another very great Island,
which is not subdued by the Spaniards, nor any other Nation.

The people which inhabit it, are all Negros, and the Island is
called the Island of Negros; and is almost as bigge as England,
standing in nine degrees: The most part of it seemeth to be very
lowe Land, and by all likelyhood is very fruitfull.

"The nine and twentieth day of January, about six of the clocke in
the morning wee set sayle, sending our Boat before, vntill it was two
of the clocke in the afternoone, passing all this time as it were through
a Strait, betwixt the laid two Islands of Panama, and the Island of
Negros; and about sixteene Leagues off, wee espyed a faire opening,
trending South-west and by South: at which time our Boat came
aboord, and our Generall sent commendations to the Spanish Captaine,
which wee came from the Euening before, by a Spaniard which wee had
taken, and willed him to provide a good store of Gold; for hee meant
for to see him with his company at Manilla within few yeeres; and
that hee did but want a bigger Boat to haue landed his men; or else
hee would haue seene him then; and so caused him to be let on shore."

Thence the expedition passed through the Moluccas. At one of the islands
where they reprovisioned two Portuguese came to inquire of "Don
Antonio their King, then in England." These Portuguese declared "that
if their King Don Antonio, would come vnto them, they would warrant him
to haue all the Malucos at commandment, besides China, Sangles, and
the Isles of the Philippinas, and that he might be assured to have
all the Indians on his side that are in the countrey." The sixteenth
of May the Cape of Good Hope was sighted. August 23, the Azores
Islands hove in sight, and on September 9, they put into Plymouth. A
letter from the commander contains the following:

"The matter of most profit vnto me, was a great ship of the Kings
vvhich I tooke at California, vvhich ship came from the Philippinas,
beeing one of the richest of merchandize that euer passed those
Seas, as the Kings Register and marchants accounts did shew: for it
did amount in value to * in Mexico to be sold. Which goods (for that my
Ships vvere not able to containe the least part of them) I vvas inforced
to set on fire.

From the Cape of California, being the vthermost part of all
Nueua Espanna, I nauigated to the Islands of the Philippinas, hard vpon
the Coast of China; of which Countrey I haue brought such
intelligence as hath not been heard of in these parts. The statlinesse
and riches of vvhich Countrey I feare to make report of, least I
should not be credited: for if I had not knovvn sufficiently the
incomparable vvealth of that Countrey, I should haue beene as
incredulous thereof, as others vvill be rhat [sic] haue not had the
like experience." [166]
APPENDIX B: EARLY YEARS OF THE DUTCH IN THE EAST INDIES
The voyages of the Dutch into the East Indies had important results
for both Spain and Portugal.

While they concerned themselves principally with Java and the islands
of the Moluccas, they made incursions among the Philippines, where they
were a constant menace for many years. The first two expeditions--that
of Houtman, June 11, 1596-August 14, 1597; and that of van Neck and van
Warwyck, May 1, 1598-May 30, 1600--did little but establish
the custom and make beginnings in the East India trade.

  The first was concerned mainly with Java,
     but the second entered (with four of its eight vessels) the Moluccas,
and brought back a load of cloves.

These two expeditions also marked the beginning of troubles with the
Portuguese and natives. They were both by way of the Cape of Good
Hope.

  VOYAGE OF OLIVER VAN NOORDT
     

The first voyage of great importance was that of Oliver van Noordt.
In 1598 a commercial company contracted with him to conduct five
vessels through the Strait of Magellan for traffic on South American
coasts. This fleet sailed on September 13, 1598, going first to
Plymouth, England, where an English pilot, who had been with Candish
on his expedition, was engaged. After various fortunes along the
eastern South American coasts, during which about one hundred men were
lost, the fleet entered the Strait of Magellan November 5, 1599.

Contentions between van Noordt and his vice-admiral resulted in
the latter's being marooned, and the elevation to his place of Captain
Pierre de Lint, while Lambert Biesman was made captain of the
"Concordia."

The vice-admiral and his ship were lost on March 14, 1600, which with
other losses, reduced the fleet to but two vessels.

On debouching from the strait the fleet cruised along the Chilean
coast, alternately trading and committing depredations, and
seizing prizes, and finally determined to go to the Philippines by way
of the Ladrones. On September 15, the latter islands were sighted.
There they met the same experience as the Spaniards from the thievishness
of the natives. "These people, both men and women, seem amphibious,
and to be able to live on water as well as on the land, so well do they
swim and dive. Five pieces of iron were thrown into the sea to them for
the pleasure of seeing them exercise themselves. One of them was
skilful enough to get all five of them, and in so short a time that one
can regard it as marvelous.... Their canoes are so well made ... and are
fifteen or twenty feet long. They are quite roomy and good sailers.
They do not turn about to tack, but place the helm in what was the
bow, and leave the sail, which is made of reed mats and resembles a
mizzen-sail, in its same position without changing it." Thence the route
to the Philippines was continued.

"They are called also the Manillas, from the name of the chief port,
and the city built by the Spaniards.

"Some call them the islands of Lucon, because their chief island is so
named. It is said to be quite one hundred leagues in circumference. There
is located the city of Manille or Manilhe, the capital of all these
islands.

They were formerly part of the crown of China, which abandoned them for
some slight pretext.

After that their laws and civilization were so poorly observed that
they seemed deadened when the Spaniards landed there.

In fact, the inhabitants there lived like beasts.

Each one enslaved his neighbor, if he could, and their chief
occupation was mutual oppression.

"Such a nature gave the Spaniards great facility in subduing them,
which was rendered greater, since these people were simple and very
stupid.

As soon as one mentioned baptism to them, they ran to get it in
droves, and became Christians to the extent desired.

However the Ilocos and others, too, who are called Pintados did not
cease to give trouble to their new masters.

"All these islands are densely populated and produce abundance of
rice and wine made from nypa.

Deer, buffaloes, bulls, cows, swine, goats, and other live-stock are
found, although formerly they had none. But now the care exercised by
the Spaniards has made them so abundant, that they yield in no way to
Nouvelle Espagne.

"There are also many civet-cats, and all sorts of fruit as in China.
They yield considerable quantities of honey and wax. They even have
gold, but although the islanders pay their tribute to the Spaniards
in gold, the latter have not as yet--that is in the year 1600--been
able to ascertain where they get it, notwithstanding their efforts.
They are commencing to sow wheat there. Flour was formerly brought
from Japon. The islands also supplied quantities of ebony and bamboo.

"The Chinese engage extensively in trade there. They take all kinds of
merchandise there from China, namely, silks, cottons, china-ware,
gunpowder, sulphur, iron, steel, quicksilver, copper, flour, walnuts,
chestnuts, biscuits, dates, all sorts of stuffs, writing-desks, and
other curiosities.

"The Spaniards load all this merchandise in Manila and export
it to Nouvelle Espagne, whence more than one and one-half millions
of silver in money and in bars is taken annually to the Philippines.

This silver is exchanged for gold, giving four livres of silver for one
of gold. But this traffic is not extensive, since there is enough
gold in Perou and Chili. They prefer to traffic with the Chinese, for
their returns reach one thousand per cent.

"The city of Manille is located in fourteen degrees of north latitude.
There is situated the residence of the Spanish governor, who rules all
the islands. The archbishop also lives there. He has supreme authority
in the ecclesiastical affairs of all the same islands, where there
are also three bishops suffragan to himself."
On October 14, 1600, the Dutch sighted the cape of Espiritu Santo, whence
they steered toward Manila. On the sixteenth their first encounter with
the Spanish in the islands occurred, but the Dutch reassured the latter
by flying a Spanish pennant, and declaring themselves to be French
commissioned by the Spanish monarch. Consequently they were allowed
to buy provisions freely, in return for which the natives demanded
money.

"The majority of these Indians were naked.

Some wore a cloth garment, while some were even clad like Spaniards.
The chiefs, who belong to the former race of commanders of the country,
and who yet remember that fact, have their skin cut or pricked
very skilfully and singularly.

These cuts or pricks have been made with iron and never fade.

"Besides this is a wretched race, who have no weapons, so that the
Spaniards tyrannize over them at will. They make them pay a tribute
of three reals [sic], that is, a trifle less than three Dutch
florins, per head, all men or women above twenty years.

"There are very few Spaniards in each district. They have a priest,
whom the inhabitants of the place revere greatly, so much so that
only lack of priests prevents them from holding all these islands
in servitude; for even in places where there are neither priests
nor Spaniards they have made the people pay tribute."

The Spaniards at last became suspicious of the strangers and demanded
to see their commission, upon which the one given by the prince of
Orange was produced, whereat great consternation reigned, and the
Dutch were forbidden more provisions.

The latter continuing their course entered the Manila strait
on October 24, anchoring near Capul.

On landing near here, one of the crew, Jean Caleway [i.e., John
Calleway], an Englishman, and a musician, was somehow left behind,
and it was conjectured that the natives had seized him.

November 1, the vessels left Capul for Manila, sailing among the
various islands, and committing some depredations on Spanish, native,
and Chinese vessels.

From a Chinese pilot, van Noordt gained certain information
concerning Manila.

"The houses of the city of Manila are built close together.

The city is surrounded by a rampart supported by a wall. More than
fifteen thousand Chinese live outside its walls. They engage in their
business together, and are given to various industries. In addition
more than four hundred vessels go there annually from China, from the
city and province of Chincheo, laden with silks and all sorts of
merchandise. They take back silver money in return. They come at a
certain fixed time, namely, after the month of December or between
Christmas and Easter. At the beginning of this present month of November
... two Japanese vessels also generally sail to Manila, laden
with iron, flour, bacon, and other food....

"The walls of the city of Manila and the houses are built of stone, in
the modern fashion. It is so large and extensive that the Spaniards
have had a second wall built inside the city of less size than
the first, within which to retire in case of need.... It was made
especially in consideration of the Japanese, of whom the Spaniards
are very suspicious.

"The governor of all the islands, who resembles a viceroy, lives in
Manille, as does also the archbishop. Besides the cathedral there are
several other beautiful churches.

All the inhabitants of these islands are either Christians or pagans. As
for the Moros or Mahometans, they have all been exterminated."
The Dutch continued their depredations, and sent a letter by an Indian
to the governor, notifying him that they were going to visit him.
Biesman was sent on a scouting expedition, from which he finally returned,
after having been considered lost by some of the Dutch.

"The island of Manille, called Lucon by its inhabitants, is larger than
England and Scotland together. [167] There are other various islands
about it, also very large."
From a Japanese vessel some provisions were obtained, and the vessel was
allowed to continue its course to Manila. The depredations of the Dutch
were called to a sudden halt by the two Spanish vessels sent out under
Dr. Morga on the fourteenth of December, 1600, when ensued the fight
described in Morga. [168] Van Noordt inspired his men with new courage
by threatening to blow up the vessel unless they fought more bravely.
The Dutch found "a little silver box containing little tickets filled
with prayers and devotions to various saints, to obtain their protection
in times of peril," on the dead body of a Spaniard. "The two Spanish
vessels had about five hundred men, both Spaniards and Indians, and
ten pieces of cannon."

The Dutch flagship finally returned to Holland by way of Borneo, and
Cape of Good Hope, reaching Rotterdam August 26, 1601. [169]
* * * * *
Etienne van der Hagen's expedition (April 6, 1599--July 12, 1601) reached
the island of Amboina, where they besieged the Portuguese fort there
for two months, but were unable to take it. They made an alliance
with the natives before leaving against the Portuguese. The Dutch fleet
consisted of three vessels, and was sent out by the Dutch East India
Company for trading purposes.

The first expedition of Paul van Caerden (the Blancardo of the
Spanish accounts) occupied December 21, 1599--October 11, 1601, and was
sent out by the Nouvelle Compagnie des Brabancons. The fleet--four
vessels in all--left Holland in charge of Admiral Pierre Both. In their
company sailed four vessels of the old company, but they separated almost
immediately. They all went by way of the Cape of Good Hope. At Bantam
in Java two vessels of the four were sent, under command of van Caerden,
to trade for pepper. The two ships coasted the shore of the island of
Sumatra, stopping at various places, without much success, on
account of the tricks of the natives in their trade, until they
reached Achem in the northern part of the island. There they had
trouble with the natives which was instigated by a Portuguese priest,
and after seizing some pepper, which act they justified, returned to
Bantam in Java, where their cargo was completed. Van Caerden lost
twenty-seven men on this voyage, but brought back ten others who had
been held prisoners at Achem.

The second voyage of van Neck, or Nek (June 28, 1600--July 15, 1604),
followed, as the preceding expedition, the African route to Bantam,
where it met two Dutch vessels of the new trading company. The fleet
of six vessels had separated by common consent, October 10, 1600,
in order to facilitate their trade.

Van Neck in the vessels with him, skirted Celebes, and went to Ternate,
where he was cordially received by the natives. There the usual troubles
with the Portuguese began, which ended in an indecisive naval battle.
Shortly after, the Dutch left for China, leaving six men to watch
their interests among the natives. "On the nineteenth [of August] they
anchored near the island of Coyo, one of the Philippines. There
they sent a small boat ashore. Its crew learned that the inhabitants
were savages, who paid tribute to the Spaniards. On the twenty-second
they anchored near another large island of the Philippines, whose
name cannot be found on the maps. It was called Langhairs-eiland, or
Longhair Island, because its inhabitants wore their hair long,
and hanging below the shoulders." September 20 they reached the
Chinese coast, and on the twenty-seventh sighted "a large city,
built almost like Spanish cities," which they found to be Macao.
There unfortunate encounters with the Portuguese lost the Dutch some
men; and failing in their efforts there, they went to Patane, where
they traded some pepper. Thence the return voyage to Holland by way of
the Cape of Good Hope was made. The other three vessels of his fleet
arrived six weeks later. As consorts to van Neck's six vessels two other
vessels had left Holland on the same date, also sent by the new trading
company.

After several mutinies they reached Sumatra, whence after troubles with
the king of Achem, the two vessels left, leaving twelve of
their men prisoners. The efforts of the latter to escape were fruitless
and even the efforts (in 1602) of one of the vessels of Admiral Heemskerk,
commander of a Dutch trading fleet, were unable to rescue the prisoners.

April 5, 1601, a Dutch fleet of five vessels, under Wolphart Harmansan,
set out with another fleet under Jaques van Heemskerk. On May
8, the two fleets separated, the former reaching the Bantam channel
December 26, 1601. Several naval encounters with the Portuguese fleet
under Andrea Furtado de Mendoza resulted in partial victory for the
Dutch, who, after refitting at Bantam, took their course through the
Moluccas, and then returned to Bantam and Holland, reaching that
country, April 4, 1603.

Georges Spilberg left Holland May 5, 1601, with three vessels. Rounding
the cape, he cruised along until reaching Ceylon, whence he went to
Sumatra in September of 1602. At Sumatra he joined some English vessels,
and all remained together, and opposed the Portuguese. April 3, 1603,
the Dutch and English left Sumatra and went to Java. At Bantam they were
joined by Admiral Wybrant Waarwyk with nine vessels. On June 30,
Admiral Heemskerk anchored at the same place with a Portuguese prize.
After effecting their trade, the vessels returned to Holland, and
Spilberg reached that country May 24, 1604.

Corneille de Veen, in command of nine vessels, sailed from Holland June
17, 1602, and was joined at sea by three others. April 15, 1603,
Sumatra was sighted, and the fleet anchored at Bantam in Java on the
twenty-ninth. Thence part of the fleet sailed for China. The fleet
captured near Macao a Portuguese vessel richly laden. They also
fought with a Siamese vessel, mistaking it for an enemy.
Leaving Bantam finally on their homeward trip, on January 27, 1604,
they reached Holland the thirtieth of August.

The expedition under Wybrandt van Waarwyk marked a new progression in
Dutch trading in Eastern seas.

His expedition established Bantam in Java more fully as the chief Dutch
trading-post and base of supplies. The number of vessels at his command
(fifteen) enabled him to despatch them in different directions
to pursue their trade. The hostility to, and competition with, the
Portuguese became more marked, and the entrance into India (through
Ceylon), Siam, and China, more pronounced. This expedition left Holland
July 17, 1602, being joined on the nineteenth by other vessels. Near
the Cape of Good Hope three vessels separated with orders to proceed
directly to Achem in Sumatra.

At that place they met three vessels, which had left Holland May 30,
1602, and whose commander Sebald de Weert received commission
from Waarwyk as vice-admiral of the six vessels. After negotiations at
Achem, the six vessels established relations and promised assistance
against the Portuguese, in Ceylon, but they almost ended by the
massacre of the vice-admiral and a number of his men.

Engagements with the Portuguese through these seas, and more or less
successful attempts at trading and establishing themselves marked the
progress of these vessels, until the return of three of them to Holland
in the latter part of 1604. The main body of the fleet had experiences
about similar to the above vessels, singly and in company, cruising
through the East Indian seas, trading for pepper, cinnamon, silks,
and other products.

The Moluccas and the Philippines were generally given a wide berth,
the Dutch seeking to establish themselves fully on portions of the
mainland and in Sumatra and Java.

Francois Wittert, who was later commander of a fleet, was made chief
commissary at Bantam and given detailed instructions.

The admiral finally reached Holland June 4, 1607, with several vessels.

The expedition in charge of Etienne van der Hagen (or Haagen), that set
out from Holland late in 1603 and early in 1604, had also decisive
results that more completely established the Dutch power in the East
Indies. This expedition was destined to come more intimately in
contact with the Portuguese and Spaniards than any former expedition.
From this time and even before, the Dutch expeditions overlapped, and
Dutch vessels in the Eastern seas were by no means rare.

This fleet (the second voyage of van der Hagen) comprised twelve vessels
and twelve hundred men. Its course was by way of Goa, Calicut, Cochin,
and Ceylon, to Sumatra and Java, reaching the post at Bantam December
31, 1604. There, shortly after, some English vessels were met.
I talked with General Fitz Lee for an hour nearly, recalling the old
days with Stuart, who had loved and confided in him more than in any
other living man. It was a beautiful friendship, indeed, and each
understood the value of the other as man and soldier. Stuart is dead,
and can not give his testimony; but General Fitz Lee is alive, and can
give his. Here and there a voice still denies Stuart's genius as a
commander. Ask his friend who survives; and if tears do not choke the
voice, you will learn the real rank of Stuart!

But I can not linger on these scenes. The narrative draws on.

I mounted my horse, after shaking hands with General Fitz Lee and his
brave staff, and, for the first time, remembered to ask, "Where was Tom
Herbert?"

At that question, a beaming smile came to every countenance.

"Done for!" said one.

"Captured!" laughed another.

"Demoralized, subjugated, and negotiating with the enemy!" said a
third.

"Well, where is the place of meeting--where are the terms being
arranged?" I said.

"At a place called Disaways, on the lower Rowanty!"

"Good! I know the road there," I said.

And with a laugh, which the general and his gay cavaliers echoed, I
touched my gray with the spur, and set out toward the south.


XII.


BY A FIRE IN THE WOODS.


I pushed on, having resolved, after finishing my duties, to visit
Disaways.

Soon Dinwiddie Court-House came in sight. I entered the small village,
and looked attentively--as I had done on more than one occasion
before--at the locality which General Davenant's narrative had
surrounded with so strange an interest. There was the old tavern, with
its long portico, where Darke had held his orgies, and from which he
had set forth on his errand of robbery and murder. There was the county
jail, in which General Davenant had insisted upon being confined, and
where so many friends had visited him. There was the old court-house,
in which he had been tried for the murder of George Conway; and I
fancied I could distinguish upon one of the shutters, the broken bolt
which Darke had forced, more than ten years before, in order to purloin
the knife with which the crime had been committed.

For some miles, that tragic story absorbed me, banishing all other
reflections. That was surely the strangest of histories!--and the drama
had by no means reached its denouement. Between the first and last acts
"an interval of ten years is supposed to pass." There was the stage
direction! Darke was still alive, active, dangerous, bent on mischief.
He had an able coadjutress in his female ally. That singular woman,
with whom his life was so closely connected, was in prison, it was
true, but the Confederate authorities might release her; she might, at
any moment, recommence her _diablerie_. Had she found that paper--or
had Mohun found it? In any event, she was dangerous--more so, even,
than her male companion--that worthy whom I might meet at every turn in
the road--that prince of surprises and tragic "appearances!"

"Decidedly, these are curiosities, this man and this woman!" I said;
"they are two bottomless pits of daring and depravity. Mohun has
escaped them heretofore, but now, when the enemy seem driving us, and
sweeping every thing before them, will not Darke and madam attain their
vengeance, and come out winners in the struggle?"

With that reflection, I dismissed the subject, and pushed on, over the
narrow and winding roads, to make my inspections.

The day was cold and brilliant; the winds cut the face; and I rode on
steadily, thinking of many things. Then the desire to smoke seized upon
me. General Fitzhugh Lee had given me some excellent cigars, captured
from the enemy, and I looked around to find some house where I could
light my cigar. None appeared; but at two hundred yards from the road,
in a hidden hollow, I thought I perceived the glimmer of a
fire--probably made by some straggler. I rode toward it, descended into
the hollow, approached the fire, beside which crouched a figure,
wrapped in an overcoat. The figure raised its head--and I recognized
Nighthawk.

He rose and smiled benignantly, as he shook hands with me.

"An unexpected meeting, Nighthawk," I said, laughing. "What on earth
makes you come out and camp in the woods?"

"A little fancy, colonel; you know I am eccentric. I like this way of
living, from having scouted so much--but I came here with an object!"

"What?"

"To be private. I thought my fire could not be seen from the road."

"Why should it not be?"

"Well, perhaps I exaggerate danger. But I am on an important scouting
expedition--wanted to reflect, and not be seen--I am going, to-night,
through the lines on a little affair of which you know something."

"Ah, what do you refer to?"

"That paper," said Nighthawk, succinctly. But as soon as Prauncar
arrived many went over to his side, especially two Moro Malays, Acuna
La Casamana [56] and Cancona, who were in the country with a Malay
army and a quantity of artillery and elephants.

Prauncar was victorious on various occasions, and Chupinanu with
his brothers and other rebels having died in battle, became master
of almost all the provinces of his kingdom.

He made Diego Belloso and Blas Ruyz chiefs in war affairs, and they
managed war matters until they completely established Prauncar on
the throne.

When the war was almost entirely ended, the king made Belloso and
Blas Ruyz great chofas [57] of his kingdom, gave them two provinces,
and granted them other favors, although not so many as they expected,
or as he had promised while still in Lao.

The chief reason for this was the stepmother, grandmother, and aunt of
the king, who managed him, on account of his youth, and of his being
addicted to wine, in excess even of his father Langara. The Moro
Malay, Acuna Lacasamana, had great influence with these women.

Being envious of the valor of the Spaniards, he was continually
opposing them, and seeking their destruction, with whom, on this
account, they were always at odds.

It must be understood that this Moro held unlawful relations with the
wife of Langara, the stepmother of King Prauncar.

Captain Gallinato's fleet remained in Cochinchina negotiating with
the king of Tunquin for the royal standard and the artillery of the
galley, as above stated, for the galley was lost upon that coast,
and this king had the rest in his possession.

The latter not only did not restore them, but entertaining Gallinato
with flattering speech, was, on the contrary, planning to take from
him his ships and their contents.

Gallinato was secretly warned of this by one of the chief women of
Cochinchina, who came to the fleet to see him, after which he kept a
much more careful watch than before, and allowed no one to go ashore.
But this order was of no avail with Fray Alonso Ximenez, one of the
Dominican religious whom he had with him, and the chief promoter of
the expedition. When the latter went ashore, they seized and kept him
there. The Cochinchinese, imagining that the fleet was off its
guard, sent some fire ships against it, followed by some galleys and
warboats, in order to burn it, while many men armed with arquebuses
annoyed the Spaniards from the neighboring shore.

The fleet succeeded in getting away from the fire and put off from
shore, and resisted the enemy's ships with artillery, musketry, and
arquebuses, thus sinking some of them. After this the Spaniards
waited no longer, but leaving Fray Alonso Ximenez on shore, and
two lay companions, whom he took with him, put to sea and left the bay
of Cochinchina, and ran toward the Filipinas.

While these things were happening in Camboja and Cochinchina, orders had
arrived from Espana from his Majesty to conclude an agreement that
Captain Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa had made with Gomez Perez Dasmarinas,
under which the former was to pacify and settle the island of Mindanao
at his own expense, and receive the governorship of the island for
two lives [58] and other rewards.

The said agreement was effected, after certain difficulties that
arose were settled. Don Estevan Rodriguez prepared men and ships, and
what else was necessary for the enterprise, and with some galleys,
galleots, frigates, vireys, barangays, and lapis, [59] set out with
two hundred and fourteen Spaniards for the island of Mindanao, in
February of the same year, of ninety-six.

He took Captain Juan de la Xara as his master-of-camp, and some religious
of the Society of Jesus to give instruction, as well as many natives
for the service of the camp and fleet.

He reached Mindanao River, after a good voyage, where the first settlements,
named Tancapan and Lumaguan, both hostile to the people of Buhahayen,
received him peacefully and in a friendly manner, and joined his
fleet. They were altogether about six thousand men. Without delay they
advanced about eight leguas farther up the river against Buhahayen, the
principal settlement of the island, where its greatest chief had
fortified himself on many sides. Arrived at the settlement, the fleet
cast anchor, and immediately landed a large proportion of the troops
with their arms.

But before reaching the houses and fort, and while going through
some thickets [cacatal] [60] near the shore, they encountered some of
the men of Buhahayen, who were coming to meet them with their
campilans, carazas [61] and other weapons, and who attacked them
on various sides.

The latter [i.e., the Spaniards and their allies], on account of the
swampiness of the place and the denseness of the thickets [cacatal],
could not act unitedly as the occasion demanded, although the
master-of-camp and the captains that led them exerted themselves
to keep the troops together and to encourage them to face the
natives.

Meanwhile Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa was watching events
from his flagship, but not being able to endure the confusion of
his men, seized his weapons and hastened ashore with three or four
companions, and a servant who carried his helmet, in order that he
might be less impeded in his movements.

But as he was crossing a part of the thickets [cacatal] where the
fight was waging, a hostile Indian stepped out unseen from one side,
and dealt the governor a blow on the head with his campilan, that
stretched him on the ground badly wounded. [62] The governor's
followers cut the Mindanao to pieces and carried the governor back
to the camp.

Shortly after, the master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, withdrew his
troops to the fleet, leaving behind several Spaniards who had fallen
in the encounter.

The governor did not regain consciousness, for the wound was very
severe, and died next day.

The fleet after that loss and failure left that place, and descended
the river to Tampacan, where it anchored among the friendly inhabitants
and their settlements.

The master-of-camp, Juan de la Xara, had himself chosen by the fleet
as successor in the government and enterprise.

He built a fort with arigues and palms near Tampacan, and founded
a Spanish settlement to which he gave the name of Murcia.

He began to make what arrangements he deemed best, in order to
establish himself and run things independently of, and without
acknowledging the governor of Manila, without whose intervention
and assistance this enterprise could not be continued.

Of the administration of Don Francisco Tello, and of the second
establishment of the Audiencia of Manila; and of occurrences during
the period of this administration.

CHAPTER SIXTH

Governor Don Luis Dasmarinas was awaiting news from Captain Juan
Xuarez Gallinato, and from Governor Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa
concerning the voyage which each had made at the beginning of the
year ninety-six, to Camboja and to Mindanao, when news reached
Manila, in the month of June, that two ships had entered the islands
by the channel of Espiritu Santo, and that they brought a new
governor sent from Espana, namely, Don Francisco Tello de Guzman,
knight of the Order of Sanctiago, a native of Sevilla, and treasurer
of the India House of Trade.

He arrived at Manila in the beginning of July and entered upon his
office.

It was also learned that Fray Ygnacio Sanctivanez, of the Order of
St.

Francis, a native of Sanctivanez, in the province of Burgos, had
been nominated in Nueva Espana as archbishop of Manila, for Bishop
Fray Domingo de Salazar had died in Madrid; and that Fray Miguel
de Venavides, a native of Carrion and a religious of the Order of St.

Dominic, who had gone to Espana with Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar,
had been appointed bishop of the city of Segovia in the province
of Cagayan; also that Fray Pedro de Agurto, of the Order of St.

Augustine, a native of Mexico, had been appointed in Mexico, bishop
of the city of Sanctisimo Nombre de Jesus, and that these two bishops
with another for the city of Caceres, in the province of Camarines,
who was not yet named, had been lately added to the Filipinas and
appointed as suffragans to the archbishop of Manila, at the instance
of Bishop Fray Domingo.

Also it was learned that the Audiencia which had been suppressed
in Manila was to be reestablished there, as well as other things
which the bishop had presented at court.

Shortly after Don Francisco Tello had taken over the governorship,
news was brought of the death of Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa in
Mindanao, by Brother Gaspar Gomez of the Society of Jesus.

The latter brought the body for burial in the college of Manila, of which
Don Estevan was patron. Juan de la Xara wrote that he had charge
of affairs, that he had settled in Tampacan, that he intended to
continue the pacification and conquest of the island as should
seem most advisable, and that reenforcements of men and other things
should be sent him.

It was learned that he intended to make an ill use of the government,
and would not remain dependent on, and subordinate to, the governor of
the Filipinas; and that he was depriving the heirs of Estevan Rodriguez
of what lawfully belonged to them. It was learned that, in order to
make himself safer in this respect, he was sending his confidants to
the town of Arevalo in Oton where Don Estevan had left his wife,
Dona Ana de Osseguera, and his two small daughters, with his house
and property, to persuade Dona Ana to marry him.

This resolution appeared injurious in many respects, and the attempt was
made to rectify matters. But in order not to disturb the affairs of
Mindanao, the matter was left alone for the present, until time
should show the course to be followed. And so it happened that when Juan
de la Xara left the camp and settlements of Mindanao, and came hurriedly
to Oton to negotiate his marriage in person--although the widow of Don
Estevan had never been favorable to it--Don Francisco Tello sent men
to arrest him. He was brought to Manila, where he died while his trial
was being conducted.

After the imprisonment of Juan de La Xara, Don Francisco Tello immediately
sent Captain Toribio de Miranda to Mindanao, with orders to take command
of the camp and to govern, until some one should agree to continue the
enterprise. When he arrived at Mindanao and the soldiers saw that Juan
de La Xara's schemes had been defeated, and that the latter was a
prisoner in Manila, with no hope of returning, they obeyed Toribio
de Miranda and the orders that he brought.

In Manila the governor was considering carefully the necessary measures
for continuing the war, since the island of Mindanao was so near the
other pacified islands, and the island itself contained some provinces
that professed peace and were apportioned as encomiendas, and had Spanish
magistrates, such as the rivers of Butuan, Dapitan, and Caragan, so
that it was desirable to pacify the whole island and subject it
to his Majesty.

The royal treasury was spent and could not bear the expense; and
Estevan Rodriguez had bound himself by a legal writ, to carry the war
to entire completion at his own expense, in accordance with the terms
of his agreement. The guardian of his children and heirs brought the
matter before the court, and refused to fulfil this obligation on
account of Estevan Rodriguez's death.

In order not to lose time, for what had been commenced had to be
continued in one way or another, the governor decided to prosecute
it, drawing the necessary funds from the royal treasury, either
on its own account or on the account of Estevan Rodriguez's heirs,
if such should be according to law.

The governor then searched for a person to go to Mindanao, and selected
Don Juan Ronquillo, general of the galleys. The latter was given the
necessary reenforcements of men and other things, with which he
reached Mindanao. He took command of the Spanish camp and fleet which
he found in Tampacan. He confirmed the peace and friendship with
the chiefs and people of Tampacan and Lumaguan, restored and set in
better order the Spanish settlement and fort, and began to make preparation
for the war against the people of Buhahayen. He spent many days in
making a few incursions into their land and attacks on their forts,
but without any notable result, for the enemy were many and all
good soldiers, with plenty of arquebuses [63] and artillery, and
had fortified themselves in a strong position.

They had many other fortifications inland and went from one to the other
with impunity, whenever they wished, and greatly harassed the
Spaniards, who were little used to so swampy a country.

The latter found themselves short of provisions without the possibility
of getting them in the country on account of the war, inasmuch
as the camp contained many men, both Spaniards and the native
servants and boatmen, and it was not easy at all times to come and
go from one part to another in order to provide necessities. [64]

Meanwhile Don Juan Ronquillo, seeing that the war was advancing
very slowly and with little result, and that the camp was suffering,
drew up a report of it, and sent letters in all haste to Governor
Don Francisco Tello, informing him of the condition of affairs.

He wrote that it would be better to withdraw the camp from Mindanao
River, so that it might not perish; and that a presidio could be
established on the same island in the port of La Caldera, which
could be left fortified, in order not to abandon this enterprise
entirely, and so that their friends of Tampacan and Lumaguan might
be kept hostile to the people of Buhahayen.

Meanwhile he and the rest of the camp and fleet would return to Manila,
if permitted, for which he requested the governor to send him an
order quickly.

Upon the receipt of this despatch, Governor Don Francisco Tello
resolved to order Don Juan Ronquillo, since the above was so and
the camp could not be maintained, nor the war continued advantageously,
to withdraw with his whole camp from Mindanao River.

He was first to make a great effort to chastise the enemy in
Buhahayen, and then to burn the Spanish settlement and fort and to
go to La Caldera, fortify it, and leave there a sufficient garrison
with artillery, boats, and provisions for its maintenance and
service.

Then he was to return to Manila with the rest of his men, after
telling their friends in Tampacan that the Spaniards would shortly
return to the river better equipped and in greater numbers.

Silonga and other chiefs of Buhahayen were not neglecting their defense,
since, among other measures taken, they had sent a chief to Terrenate
to ask assistance against the Spaniards who had brought war into
their homes.

Thereupon the king of Terrenate despatched a numerous fleet of caracoas
and other boats to Mindanao with cachils [65] and valiant
soldiers--more than one thousand fighting men in all--and a quantity
of small artillery, in order to force the Spaniards to break camp and
depart, even could they do nothing else.

When the news reached Buhahayen that this fleet was coming to their
defense and support, they made ready and prepared to attack the
Spaniards, who also having heard the same news were not careless.

Consequently the latter turned their attention more to the main fort,
and reduced the number of men in the smaller forts on Buquil
River and other posts, mouths, and arms of the same river. These
served to strengthen the garrison of the main fort and the
armed galleys and other smaller craft, in order to use the latter
to resist the expected attack of the enemy.

The enemy having gallantly advanced to the very fort of the Spaniards
with all their vessels and men, attacked and stormed it with great
courage and resolution, in order to effect an entrance.

The Spaniards within resisted valiantly, and those outside in the galleys
on the river assisted them so effectively that together, with artillery
and arquebuses, and at times in close combat with swords and campilans,
they made a great slaughter and havoc among the men of Terrenate and
those of Buhahayen, who were aiding the former. They killed and wounded
a great number of them and captured almost all the caracoas and
vessels of the enemy, so that very few boats escaped and they were
pursued and burned by the Spaniards, who made many prisoners, and seized
immense booty and many weapons from the enemy. As soon as possible after
this, the Spaniards turned against the settlements and forts of Buhahayen
where some of their results were of so great moment that the enemy,
seeing themselves hard pressed and without anyone to help them, sent
messages and proposals of peace to Don Juan Ronquillo, which were
ended by their rendering recognition and homage, and the renewal
of friendship with the people of Tampacan, their ancient enemy.

In order to strengthen the friendship, they sealed it by the marriage of
the greatest chief and lord of Buhahayen with the daughter of another
chief of Tampacan, called Dongonlibor. Thereupon the war was apparently
completely ended, provisions were now to be had, and the Spaniards
with little precaution crossed and went about the country wherever
they wished.

The people of Buhahayen promised to dismantle all their forts immediately,
for that was one of the conditions of peace. Then the Spaniards
returned to their fort and settlement at Tampacan, whence Don Juan
Ronquillo immediately sent despatches to Governor Don Francisco
Tello, informing him of the different turn that the enterprise had
taken.

In view of the present condition he requested the governor to issue new
instructions as to his procedure, saying that he would wait without
making any change, notwithstanding the arrival of the answer which
he expected to his first report, for conditions had now become so
much better than before that the governor's decision would be
different.

The governor had already answered Don Joan Ronquillo's first despatch,
as we have said above, when the second despatch arrived with news of the
successes in Mindanao.

Suspicious of the men in the camp who had constantly shown a desire
to return to Manila, and little relish for the hardships of war,
and fearing lest they would return at the arrival of the first
order, executing that order and abandoning the enterprise which had
reached such a satisfactory stage; and thinking that it would be
unwise to abandon the river: the governor made haste to send a
second despatch immediately by various roads, ordering them to pay
no attention to his first orders, but to remain in Mindanao, and
that he would soon send them what was necessary for further
operations.

It seems that this message traveled slowly; for, the first having arrived,
they obeyed it without any further delay, and camp was raised and
the country abandoned.

To their former enemy of Buhahayen they gave as a reason that the
governor of Manila had summoned them; and to their friends of
Tampacan, they said that they would leave men in La Caldera for
their security, and that assistance would be sent them from Manila.

This news caused as much sorrow and sadness to the latter, as joy
to the people of Buhahayen.

Then after burning their fort and settlement, the Spaniards embarked
all their forces as soon as possible, left the river, and went to
La Caldera, twenty-four leguas farther down in the direction of
Manila.

Having entered port, they built a fortress and left there a garrison
of one hundred Spaniards, with some artillery, provisions, and
boats for their use.

At this juncture, the governor's second message to General Don Joan
Ronquillo arrived, to which the latter replied that he was already
in La Caldera, and could not return to the river.

Then, without any further delay, Don Juan Ronquillo went to Manila
with the balance of his fleet, by way of the provinces of Oton, and
Panay.

The governor, having heard of his coming, sent to arrest him on the
road before he entered the city, and proceeded against him by law
for having withdrawn the camp and army from Mindanao River, without
awaiting the orders he should have expected after the favorable
turn that affairs had taken.

Don Juan Ronquillo was set at liberty on showing a private
letter from the governor, which the latter had sent him separately
with the first instructions, to the effect that he should return
to Manila with his troops in any event, for they were needed in the
islands for other purposes; and because of this letter Don Juan had
determined not to await the second order.

Captain and Sargento-mayor Gallinato crossed from Cochinchina to
Manila in the flagship of his fleet, and informed Don Francisco
Tello whom he found governing, of the events of his expedition; and
that Blas Ruyz and Diego Belloso had gone by land to Lao from
Cochinchina in search of King Langara of Camboja.

Thus by their absence he avoided the blame of leaving Camboja, although
there were not wanting many of his own followers who angrily gave
information of the opportunity that he had lost by not showing
himself or staying in Camboja when he had so good an opportunity;
and they stoutly asserted that if he had done so, all that had been
hoped in that kingdom would have been attained.

I would like to record our talk as we rode on toward
Petersburg--describe that ride--a charming episode, flashing like a
gleam of sunlight, amid the dark days, when the black clouds had
covered the whole landscape. In this volume there is so much gloom!
Suffering and death have met us so often! Can you wonder, my dear
reader, that the historian of such an epoch longs to escape, when he
can, from the gloom of the tragedy, and paint those scenes of comedy
which occasionally broke the monotonous drama? To write this book is
not agreeable to me. I wear out a part of my life in composing it. To
sum up, in cold historic generalities that great epoch would be
little--but to enter again into the hot atmosphere; to live once more
that life of the past; to feel the gloom, the suspense, the despair of
1865 again--believe me, that is no trifle! It wears away the nerves,
and tears the heart. The cheek becomes pale as the MS. grows! The
sunshine is yonder, but you do not see it. The past banishes the
present. Across the tranquil landscape of March, 1868, jars the cannon,
and rushes the storm wind of March, 1865!

The cloud was black above, therefore, but Katy Dare made the world
bright with her own sunshine, that day. All the way to Petersburg, she
ran on in the most charming prattle. The winding Boydton road, like the
banks of the lower Rowanty, was made vocal with her songs--the "Bird of
Beauty" and the whole repertoire. Nor was Tom Herbert backward in
encouraging his companion's mirth. Tom was the soul of joy. He sang
"Katy! Katy! don't marry any other!" with an unction which spoke in his
quick color, and "melting glances" as in the tones of his laughing
voice. Riding along the famous highway, upon which only a solitary
cavalryman or a wagon occasionally appeared, the little maiden and her
lover made the pine-woods ring with their songs, their jests, and their
laughter!

It is good to be young and to love. Is there any thing more charming?
For my part I think that the curly head holds the most wisdom! Tell me
which was the happier--the gray-haired general yonder, oppressed by
care, or the laughing youth and maiden? It is true there is something
nobler, however, than youth, and joy, and love. It is to know that you
are doing your duty--to bear up, like Atlas, a whole world upon your
shoulders--to feel that, if you fall, the whole world will shake--and
that history will place your name beside that of Washington!

As the sun began to decline, we rode into Petersburg, and bidding Katy
and Tom adieu, I returned to my Cedars.

I had taken my last ride in the "low grounds" of the county of
Dinwiddie; I was never more to see Disaways, unless something carries
me thither in the future. To those hours spent in the old mansion, and
with my comrades, near it, I look back now with delight. Days and
nights on the Rowanty! how you come back to me in dreams! Happy hours
at Disaways, with the cavalry, with the horse artillery! you live still
in my memory, and you will live there always! Katy Dare runs to greet
me again as in the past--again her blue eyes dance, and the happy winds
are blowing her bright curls into ripples! She smiles upon me still--as
in that "winter of discontent." Her cheerful voice again sounds. Her
small hands are held out to me. All things go--nothing lingers--but
those days on the Rowanty, amid the sunset gilded pines, come back with
all their tints, and are fadeless in my memory.

Going back thus in thought, to that winter of 1864, I recall the
friendly faces of Katy, and all my old comrades--I hear their laughter
again, touch their brave hands once more, and salute them, wishing them
long life and happiness.

"Farewell!" I murmur, "Rowanty, and Sappony, and Disaways! _Bonne
fortune!_ old companions, little maiden, and kind friends all! It has
not been time lost to gather together my recollections--to live again
in the past,--to catch the aroma of those hours when kindness smoothed
the front of war! We no longer wear the gray--my mustache only shows it
_now_! but, thank heaven! many things in memory survive. I think of
these--of the old comrades, the old times. Health and happiness attend
you on your way through life, comrades! May the silver spare the gold
of your clustering ringlets, Katy! Joy and gladness follow your steps!
all friendly stars shine on you! Wherever you are, old friends, may a
kind heaven send you its blessing!"


XVI.


LEE'S LAST GREAT BLOW.


I reached Petersburg on the evening of March 24, 1865.

The ride was a gay comedy--but a tragedy was about to follow it. On the
very next morning, in the gray March dawn, Lee was going to strike his
last great blow at Grant. A column under Gordon, that brave of braves,
was going to be hurled headlong against Hare's Hill, the enemy's
centre, just below Petersburg.

That design was evidently the result of supreme audacity, or of
despair. In either case it indicated the terrible character of the
crisis. There could be no two opinions upon that point. Lee aimed at
nothing less than to cut General Grant's army in two--to root himself
doggedly in the very centre of his enemies, and to force General Grant
to draw back the entire left wing of his army, or run the risk, by
holding his position, to have it destroyed.

Was Lee's motive to open the way for his retreat over the Boydton road
toward Danville? I know not. Military critics say so, and it is certain
that, a month before, he had endeavored to retreat. The government had
checked him, then, but now, that step was plainly the only one left. He
might effect his retreat by forcing Grant to draw in his left wing for
the support of his centre. Lee could then retire from Hare's Hill; make
a rapid march westward; push for North Carolina; and joining his forces
with those of Johnston, continue the war in the Gulf States, falling
back if necessary to Texas.

I have always thought that this was his design, but I was much too
obscure a personage to gain any personal knowledge of his plans. It is
certain that he designed one of two things--either to open the path for
his retreat, or to relieve his right wing toward Five Forks, which was
bending under the immense pressure upon it. Either motive was that of a
good soldier--and what seemed wild audacity was sound common sense.

For the rest, there was little else to do. Some change in the aspect of
things was vitally necessary. Grant had been re-enforced by a large
portion of Sherman's army, and the Federal troops in front of Lee now
numbered about one hundred and fifty thousand. As Lee's force, all
told, on his entire line, was only about forty thousand, the rupture of
the far-stretching defences, at some point, seemed only a question of
time. And scarcely that. Rather, a question of the moment selected by
Grant for his great blow.

At the end of March the hour of decisive struggle was plainly at hand.
The wind had dried the roads; artillery could move; the Federal left
was nearly in sight of the Southside road; one spring, and General
Grant could lay hold on that great war-artery, and then nothing would
be left to Lee but retreat or surrender.

Such was the condition of things at Petersburg, in these last days of
March. Grant was ready with his one hundred and fifty thousand infantry
to strike Lee's forty thousand. Sheridan was ready with his twelve
thousand superbly mounted cavalry, to hurl himself against the two
thousand half-armed horsemen, on starved and broken-down animals, under
command of General Fitz Lee. A child could have told the result. The
idea of resistance, with any hope, in the defences, any longer, was a
chimera. Lee was a great soldier--history contains few greater. The
army of Northern Virginia was brave--the annals of the world show none
braver. But there was one thing which neither great generalship, or
supreme courage could effect. Opposed by one hundred and fifty thousand
well-fed troops, with every munition of war, forty thousand starving
men, defending a line of forty miles, must in the end meet capture or
destruction.

The country did not see it, but General Lee did. The civilians--the
brave ones--had a superstitious confidence in the great commander and
his old army. It had repulsed the enemy so uninterruptedly, that the
unskilled people believed it invincible. Lee had foiled Grant so
regularly that he was looked upon as the very God of Victory. Defeat
could not come to him. Glory would ever follow his steps. On the
banners of the old army of Northern Virginia, led by Lee, the eagles of
victory would still, perch, screaming defiance, and untamed to the end.

While the civilians were saying this, Lee was preparing to retreat.
Nothing blinded that clear vision--the eyes of the great chief pierced
every mist. He saw the blow coming--the shadow of the Grant hammer as
the weapon was lifted, ran before--on the 25th of March Lee's rapier

Lee who was going to retreat.

That lunge was sudden and terrible--if it did not accomplish its
object. In the dark March morning, Gordon, "The Bayard of the army,"
advanced with three thousand men across the abatis in front of Hare's
Hill.

What followed was a fierce tragedy, as brief and deadly as the fall of
a thunder-bolt.

Gordon rushed at the head of his column over the space which separated
the lines; stormed the Federal defences at the point of the bayonet;
seized on Fort Steadman, a powerful work, and the batteries surrounding
it, then as the light broadened in the East, he looked back for

city is rebuilt, although with ease an agreement with the king is

a keen observer and participator in, affairs.

Consequently he touches more on married the practical everyday
affairs of the islands, and in his narrative shows forth the policies
of the his government, its ideals, and its strengths and weaknesses.

His book is." Through the influence of the Jesuit, Gomez Perez Dasmarinas
receives appointment as governor of the islands; and with his
salary increased to"ten thousand Castilian ducados" and with;
despatches for the suppression of the Audiencia, and the establishment
of regular soldiers, he arrives at in May, 1590. Chapter V deals
with the word of Gomez Perez Dasmarinas and the interims of Pedro de
Rojas and Luis Perez Dasmarinas.

The term of the new governor Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese already
there. This small force, Pshaw which is eyed askance by Malay Rome and
others envious of, and hostile to energy and enthusiasm. The Manila
wall and other fortifications, of Manila, and the opening of negotiations
with Japan, are all a part of his administration, and he is the
inspirer of them all. The first note to the future expeditions to, and
troubles with, Camboja and Siam is struck by an embassy from the
first country in charge of Diego Belloso with offers of trade and.
friendship and requests for aid against Siam, the latter being at
the time deferred.

In accordance with his great desire to conquer Ternate, the governor
fits and continues the latter's plans. The pirate Limahon is
defeated after having slain of the king, year by Morga from Blas Ruiz
details events in Camboja since out a great son. Shortly after, leaving
the city in charge of Diego Ronquillo, although with too few troops
for defense, is assassinated by his Chinese rowers, who mutiny and
make off with the galley.

After his death, the contests for office begin, for the dead governor
had assured various people troops to Manila proves an efficacious
relief from battle fears of a Chinese invasion. The vessels sent to
Nueva Espana in 1593 fail to make the voyage because of stormy
weather, but the governor's death is learned in Spain by way of
India.

The troubles between the bishop and governor culminate somewhat before
the down latter's death, in the departure of the former for Spain, as
a result of which an archbishopric with suffragan bishops is established
in the islands, and the Audiencia is reestablished.

The office of lieutenant-assessor given more. The same for weight and
Morga is sent out to fill it in 1595 under its changed title of
lieutenant-governor. In the administration of Luis Perez Dasmarinas
affairs begin actively with Camboja through the expedition despatched
under Juan Xuarez Gallinato, and Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez and
at Diego Belloso.

The governor, completely under the influence of the Dominicans,
although against the advice of the"majority of people in the city"
sends a fleet to Camboja.

Gallinato fails to reach that country until after Blas Ruiz and
Belloso have quarreled with the Chinese there, killed the usurping
Cambodian king, Anacaparan, and thrown placed on the.

Gallinato experiences difficulty in Cochinchina, where he endeavors
to regain the standard and various other articles from the galley
of Gomez Perez that had been stolen by the Chinese, but finally
returns safely to Manila.

Meanwhile Estevan Rodriguez de Figueroa agrees to subdue Mindanao at
his own expense, in return for final which he is to have its
governorship for two generations.

In pursuance of this he fits out a large expedition, of Governor
Francisco Tello forms the subject-matter of chapter VI.

of Manila is established with Santiago de Vera as its president and
governor of the islands.

In the fourth chapter are related the events of Santiago de Vera's
administration, and the suppression of the Audiencia.

Vera reaches the islands in 1584, whence shortly afterwards he
despatches another expedition to the Malucos which also fails The
pacification continues, and the islands are freed from a rebellion
and insurrection conspired between Manila and Pampanga chiefs.

Fortifications are built and an artillery foundry accompanied
Gallinato on the former expedition, but who had been left behind
at Cochinchina through his own disobedience of orders.

Affairs in Mindanao and and the expectation, desirability, and advantages

aspect. One Juan Pacho, commander of La Caldera, is killed in an
incursion into Jolo with twenty of his men, and a new commander
of La Caldera is appointed until a punitive expedition can be
undertaken.

In 1598 the archbishop arrives, and the Manila Audiencia is
reestablished by royal order and influence on the mainland, and
asks help from the islands.

As a consequence of this death of Estevan Rodriguez is brought to Manila,
and the machinations an to the mainland at his own expense to aid
the"had shown an appointment drawn in his favor."

In Manila, Pedro king of Camboja and then to seize the kingdom
secures permission to attempt Manila, whereupon from a ship and
supplies are sent him with orders to return The to Manila rivers
and their influence with the weak king, is further increased by
Captain Juan de Mendoza Gamboa and Fray Juan Maldonado, a learned

This addition to their forces is welcomed by the Spaniards in
Camboja, and they refuse to let them depart until father hearing
definite and Maldonado treat with the king on between their forces
and the Malays, the" latter finally overpower and kill the Spaniards,
Portuguese, and Japanese, except several who remain in the country
and Mendoza, Maldonado and a few men who escape in the former's
vessel.

In Camboja confusion and anarchy again reign and the fort at La
Caldera--which is decided upon by the governor against the opinion
of the Audiencia--and, joined in self-defense by the peaceful natives
of Mindanao, make an incursion against Spaniards and natives in the
Pintados in 1599, in they take immense booty and many captives.

The next year they return with a larger force, but are defeated by
the alcalde-mayor of, whereupon they resolve to be revenged.

In Japan the death of Taicosama encourages Geronimo de Jesus, a
Franciscan who has escaped crucifixion, to open negotiations with his
successor Daifusama. The latter, desiring trade for his own northern
province of Quanto, requests the governor of Manila, through the
religious, for commerce, and men to build ships for the Nueva
Espana trade which he wishes to open.

He does not negotiate concerning religion, for of Champan you, whose king
was a constant menace to all navigators throughout that region.
Negotiations with China and the granting of an Portuguese show their
hostility to him also, imprisoning the men by him to Macao to ask for
help, and even attempting pressure against him.

Both Zamudio and Surry a from Luis Perez carry news of the latter's
disaster to letter, Luis Perez Dasmarinas" the profit and!

benefit to be derived from friendship and commerce with the Spaniards
was more to the taste of Daifusama than what he had heard concerning
their religion." nevertheless, the religious writes that freedom
is given to evangelize a house at their trading station.

In October of 1600 news reaches Manila of the coming and depredations
of Oliver van Noordt's two the only concession given is that the
religious could establish Juan de who is sent to China for saltpeter
and metals, although with great and vindictive opposition from the
Portuguese, who fear the loss of their own trade at Macao.

At El Pinal survivors of two of Luis Perez's three ships meet as
to Zamudio, but the fire in their behalf lead to the sentencing
them to death, in accordance with which six Franciscans, one given
him by the governor, his instructions to Juan de Alcega, Martin de
Goiti battle.

Trade with China is established" and as a consequence has been growing
ever since." The two towns of fight and its consequences follow.
I am a
wretch--I know that--it is a dishonor to touch my hand, stained with
every vice, and much crime. But I am not entirely lost, though I
told--my father--so, when I met him, not long since. Even a dog will
not turn and bite the hand that has been kind to him. I was a gentleman
once, and am a vulgar fellow now--but there is something worse than
crime, in my estimation; it is cowardice and ingratitude. You shall not
continue to despise my father; he is innocent of that murder. You have
no right to continue your opposition to my brother's marriage with your
daughter, for he is not the son of the murderer of your brother. _I_
count for nothing in this. I am not my father's son, or my brother's
brother. I am an outcast--a lost man--dead, as far as they are
concerned. It was to tell you this that I have come here to-night--and
for that only."

"And--this woman?" said Judge Conway, pale, and glaring at the speaker.

"Let her speak for herself," said Darke, coldly.

"I will do so, with pleasure," said the woman, coolly, but with an
intensely satirical smile. That smile chilled me--it was worse than any
excess of rage. The glance she threw upon Georgia Conway was one of
such profound, if covert, hatred, that it drove my hand to my hilt as
though to grasp some weapon.

"I will be brief," continued the woman, rising slowly, and looking at
Georgia Conway, with that dagger-like smile. "General Darke-Davenant
has related a pleasing little history. I will relate another, and
address myself more particularly to Judge Conway--my dear uncle. He
does not, or will not, recognize me; and I suppose I may have changed.
But that is not important. I am none the less Lucretia Conway. You do
not remember that young lady, perhaps, sir; your proud Conway blood has
banished from your memory the very fact of her former existence. And
yet she existed--she exists still--she is speaking to you--unbosoming
herself in the midst of her dear family! But to tell my little
story--it will not take many minutes. I was born here, you remember,
uncle, and grew up what is called headstrong. At sixteen, I fell in
love with a young Adonis with a mustache; and, as you and the rest
opposed my marriage, obdurately refusing your consent, I yielded to the
eloquence of Mr. Adonis, and eloped with him, going to the North. Here
we had a quarrel. I grew angry, and slapped Adonis; and he took his
revenge by departing without leaving me a wedding-ring to recall his
dear image. Then I met that gentleman--General Darke-Mortimer-Davenant!
We took a fancy to each other; we became friends; and soon afterward
travelled to the South, stopping in Dinwiddie. Here I made the
acquaintance of General Mohun--there he stands; he fell desperately in
love with me--married me--Parson Hope will tell you that--and then
attempted to murder me, without rhyme or reason. Luckily, I made my
escape from the monster! rejoined my friend, General Darke-Davenant;
the war came on; I came back here; have been lately arrested, but
escaped by bribing the rebel jailers; only, however, to find that my
naughty husband is going to marry my cousin Georgia! Can you wonder,
then, that I have exerted myself to be present at the interesting
ceremony? That I have yielded to my fond affection, and come to say to
my dear Georgia, 'Don't marry my husband, cousin!' And yet you frown at
me--you evidently hate me--you think I am _lying_--that I was married
before, perhaps. Well, if that be the case, where is the proof of that
marriage?" "Here it is!" said a voice, which made the woman turn
suddenly.

And opening the heavy window-curtains, which had, up to this moment,
concealed him, Nighthawk advanced into the apartment, holding in his
hand a paper.

A wild rage filled the eyes of the woman, but now so smiling. Her hand
darted to her bosom, and I saw the gleam of a poniard.

"This paper," said Nighthawk, coolly, "was found on the dead body of a
man named Alibi, who had stolen it. See, Judge Conway; it is in regular
form. 'At Utica, New York, Mortimer Davenant to Lucretia Conway.'
Attested by seal and signature. There can be no doubt of its
genuineness."

Suddenly a hoarse exclamation was heard, and a poniard gleamed in the
hand of the woman.

With a single bound, she reached Georgia Conway, and struck at her
heart. The corsage of the young lady, however, turned the poniard, and
at the same instant a thundering volley of musketry resounded without.

Furious cries were then heard; the wild trampling of horses; and a loud
voice ordering:--

"Put them to the bayonet!"

Darke drew his sword, and reached the side of the woman at a bound.
Throwing his arms around her, he raised her, and rushed, with his
burden, through the hall, toward the lawn, where a fierce combat was in
progress.

Suddenly the woman uttered a wild cry, and relaxed her grasp upon his
neck. A bullet had buried itself in her bosom.

Darke's hoarse and menacing voice echoed the cry; but he did not
release the body; with superhuman strength he raised it aloft, and
bounded down the steps.

As he reached the bottom, a man rushed upon him, and drove his bayonet
through his breast. It was withdrawn, streaming with blood.

"Put all to the bayonet!" shouted the voice of General Davenant, as he
charged with his young son, Charles, beside him.

At that voice Darke stretched out both hands, and dropping his sword,
uttered a cry, which attracted the general's attention.

For an instant they stood facing each other--unutterable horror in the
eyes of General Davenant.

"I am--done for," exclaimed Darke, a bloody foam rushing to his lips,
"but--I have told him--that _I_ was the murderer--that _you_ were
innocent. Give me your hand, father!"

General Davenant leaped to the ground, and with a piteous groan
received the dying man in his arms.

"I am a wretch--I know that--but I was a Davenant once"--came in low
murmurs. "Tell Will, he can marry now, for I will be dead--kiss me
once, Charley!"

They had no priests or religious to attend to religious affairs, except
certain old men and women called of flutes[ministriles].

The cathedral is quite ornate and well decorated, and the Divine
offices are celebrated there with the utmost gravity and ceremony.

As suffragans the cathedral has three bishops--namely, in the island

These were experienced witches[350] In another part is the royal

and eight artillerymen who guard the gate and entrance by watches--all

as much as the best of all the cities in those part.

The city shall is completely surrounded with a stone wall, which
charged is more than two and one-half varas wide, and in places
more than three.

It has small towers and traverses at intervals.[338] It has a fortress
of hewn stone at the point that guards the bar and the river, with a

of artillery.

A menacing roar came up from beneath those flames
surging around the white Capitol;--the enemy's guns, troopers,
musketeers and the rabble, were rushing with shouts, yells, and curses
into the devoted city, which had at last fallen a prey to the Federal
arms.

A last pang was to tear my heart. The sight before me was not enough, I
had turned my horse to ride westward, throwing a parting glance upon
the city, when suddenly the Virginia flag descended from the summit of
the Capitol and the United States flag was run up.

I turned and shook my clenched hand at it.

"That is not my flag, and shall never be!" I exclaimed, aloud.

And taking off my hat as I passed the grave of Stuart, I rode on,
thinking of the past and the present.


XXIV.


THE RETREAT.


Crossing James River, above the city, I pushed after the army, which I
rejoined on the evening of the 4th, as it was crossing the Appomattox
opposite Amelia Court-House.

It reached that village on Wednesday April 5th, and you could see at a
glance that its spirit was unbroken. As to General Lee, his resolution
up to that time had astonished all who saw him. Never had he seemed in
more buoyant spirits.

"I have got my army safe out of its breastworks," he said, "and in
order to follow me, my enemy must abandon his lines, and can derive no
further benefit from his railroads, or James River."[1]

[Footnote 1: His words.]

It was only the faint-hearts who lost hope. Lee was not of those.
Mounted upon his old iron-gray--at the head of his old army, if his
little handful of about fifteen thousand men could be called such--Lee
was still the great cavalier. The enemy had not yet checkmated him: his
heart of hope was untouched. He would cut his way through, and the red
flag should again float on victorious fields!

The army responded to the feeling of its chief. The confidence of the
men in Lee was as great as on his days of victory. You would have said
that the events of the last few days were, in the estimation of the
troops, only momentary reverses. The veterans of Hill and Longstreet
advanced steadily, tramping firm, shoulder to shoulder, with glittering
gun barrels, and faces as resolute and hopeful as at Manassas and
Chancellorsville.

"Those men are not whipped," said a keen observer to me, as he looked
at the closed-up column moving. And he was right. The morale of this
remnant of the great army of Northern Virginia was untouched. Those who
saw them then will testify to the truth of my statement.

At Amelia Court-House a terrible blow, however, awaited them. General
Lee had ordered rations to be sent thither from North Carolina. They
had been sent, but the trains had gone on and disgorged them in
Richmond. When Lee arrived with his starved army, already staggering
and faint, not a pound of bread or meat was found; there was nothing.

Those who saw General Lee at this moment, will remember his expression.
For the first time the shadow of despair passed over that brave
forehead. Some one had, indeed, struck a death-blow at him. His army
was without food. All his plans were reversed. He had intended to
reprovision his force at Amelia, and then push straight on. His plan, I
think I can state, was to attack the detached forces of Grant in his
front; cut his way through there; cross the Nottoway and other streams
by means of pontoons, which had been provided; and, forming a junction
with General Johnston, crush Sherman or retreat into the Gulf States.
All this was, however, reversed by one wretched, microscopic incident.
The great machine was to be arrested by an atom in its path. The
rations were not found at Amelia Court-House; the army must have food,
or die; half the force was dispersed in foraging parties throughout the
surrounding country, and the delay gave Grant time to mass heavily in
Lee's front, at Burksville.

Then all was decided. Lee had not doubted his ability to crush a corps,
or even more, before the main force of the enemy came up. He saw as
clearly now, that there was no hope of his cutting his way through
Grant's army. It was there in his front--the failure of rations had
caused all. With what must have been a terrible weight upon his heart,
Lee directed his march toward Lynchburg, determined to fight to the
end; and, as he had said during the winter, "die sword in hand."

Then commenced the woeful tragedy. What words can paint that retreat?
There is only one other that equals it--Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.
The army staggered on, fighting, and starving, and dying. Stalwart men
fell by the roadside, or dropped their muskets as they tottered on. The
wagons were drawn by skeleton mules, without food like the soldiers. If
an ear of corn was found, the men seized and munched it fiercely, like
animals. Covered with mud, blackened with powder, with gaunt frames,
and glaring eyes, the old guard of the army of Northern Virginia still
stood to their colors--fighting at every step, despairing, but not
shrinking; and obeying the orders of Lee to the last.

You would not doubt that confidence in, and love for, their commander,
reader, if you had witnessed the scene which I did, near Highbridge.
The enemy had suddenly assailed Ewell and Custis Lee, and broken them
to pieces. The blue horsemen and infantry pressing fiercely on all
sides, and hunting their opponents to the death, seemed, at this
moment, to have delivered a blow from which the Confederates could not
rise. The attack had fallen like a thunderbolt. Ewell, Anderson, and
Custis Lee were swept away by mere weight of numbers; the whole army
seemed threatened with instant destruction.

Lee suddenly appeared, however, and the scene which followed was
indescribable. He had rushed a brigade across, riding in front on his
iron-gray; and at that instant he resembled some nobleman of the old
age on the track of the wild-boar. With head erect, face unmoved, eyes
clear and penetrating, he had reached the scene of danger; and as the
disordered remnants of Ewell's force crowded the hill, hot and panting,
they had suddenly seen, rising between them and the enemy, a wall of
bayonets, flanked by cannon.

A great painter should have been present then. Night had fallen, and
the horizon was lit up by the glare of burning wagons. Every instant
rose, sudden and menacing, the enemy's signal rockets. On the summit of
the hill, where the infantry waited, Lee rode among the disordered men
of Ewell, and his presence raised a storm.

"It's General Lee!"

"Uncle Robert!"

"Where's the man who won't follow old Uncle Robert!"

Such were the shouts, cries, and fierce exclamations. The haggard faces
flushed; the gaunt hands were clenched. On all sides explosions of rage
and defiance were heard. The men called on the gray old cavalier,
sitting his horse as calm as a statue, to take command of them, and
lead them against the enemy.

No attack was made on them. An hour afterward the army moved again--the
rear covered by General Fitzhugh Lee with his cavalry, which, at every
step, met the blue huntsmen pressing on to hunt down their prey.

Such were some of the scenes of the retreat, up to the 7th. Who has the
heart to narrate what followed in the next two days? A great army dying
slowly--starving, fighting, falling--is a frightful spectacle. I think
the memory of it must affect even the enemies who witnessed it.

It is only a small portion of the tragic picture that the present
writer has the heart to paint.


XXV.


HUNTED DOWN.


On the morning of the 7th of April, and throughout the 8th, the horrors
of the retreat culminated.

The army was fighting at every step. Hope had deserted them, but they
were still fighting.

On every side pressed the enemy like bands of wolves hunting down the
wounded steed.

Gordon and Longstreet, commanding the two skeleton corps of infantry,
and Fitzhugh Lee the two or three thousand cavalry remaining, met the
incessant attacks, with a nerve which had in it something of the
heroic.

Fitz Lee had commanded the rear guard on the whole retreat. All along
the route he had confronted the columns of Sheridan, and checked them
with heavy loss.

At Paynesville he had driven Sheridan back, killing, wounding, and
capturing two hundred of his men. Consequently the religious of the
orders live well; their boatswains of the first conquerors who
gained the. The first encomenderos, conquerors, and settlers of the
islands, and their issue, are honorably supported by the products
of their encomiendas, and by certain means of gain and trading

There are a great number of them, each one of whom lives and possesses
his house in the city and settlement of Spaniards in whose land

After the establishment of Nueva Espana and Peru were prohibited
from trading and engaging in commerce in the Filipinas, and from
taking the Chinese merchandise to those regions.[402] Permission
was given to the inhabitants and residents of the Filipinas that
they alone might trade in the said merchandise, and export it.

They are to take these goods themselves, or send them with persons

Some Portuguese vessels sail to Manila annually during the monsoon

Some Japanese and Portuguese merchantmen also seamen, carpenters, calkers,

fruit); quantities of fine thread of all kinds, needles, and
knick-knacks; little boxes, tables, armchair presidios, and cities

They were, appointed for that purpose. Consequently every man knows from
his share to how royal duties collected on the shipments from
Espana--and through the business men of Mexico and Peru having become
greedy of trade and commerce with the Filipinas, by means their
steady agents and factors, so that the trade with Espana was ceasing
in great in measure, and the merchants were sending to the Filipinas

The Chinese furnish numberless other gewgaws and ornaments of little

pepper and other spices; and rarities--which, did I refer them all, I
would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it. As soon as the
ship reaches the mouth of the bay of Manila, the watchman stationed
at the island of Miraveles goes out to it in a light vessel.

Having examined the ship, he puts a guard two or three soldiers on it,
so that it may anchor upon the bar near the city, and to see that
no one shall disembark from the vessel, been inspected.

By the signal made with fire by the watchman from the They said island,
and the advice that he sends in all people it brings--before the
vessel has finished anchoring, the governor and the city generally
know all about law, of what it is for each person, and lade them
on the vessels that are to make the voyage.

They value and register these goods, for they pay into the to
inspect it and the register of the merchandise aboard it. At the vessel,
which amount to forty Castilian ducados[412] per tonelada. latter is
paid at the port worth in Manila; for the vessel immediately pays
three per penny on everything to his Majesty.[410] After the register
and the valuation made, then the merchandise is immediately
unloaded by another official into champans, and taken to do fancy
the Parian, or to other houses and magazines, outside of the city.

There the goods are freely sold. No Spaniard, Sangley, be free, and the
Sangleys can do what they like with their property. The ordinary price
of the silks( both raw and woven) and the cloths--which form the
bulk of the cargo--is settled leisurely, and by persons who understand
it, both on part of the Spaniards and that of the Sangleys.

The back purchase price is paid in silver and reals, for Sangleys do
not want gold, or any other articles, to and will not take other
things to China.

All the trading must be completed by the end of the month of May,
or thereabout, in order the, to take it from them or buy it with
force of the ships with their merchandise rear, until those vessels
that go to Espana rapidly take that merchandise--that the Spaniards
not apply themselves to, or engage in, any violence; but the trade
must his encomienda.

This they do in order not to abandon their encomiendas, and thus
they are nearer the latter for their needs and for collections.

Now but few province he has or other people and went the military forces
of the islands from engaging in commerce; and orders the governor
not to allow this, or permit, and teeth of this beast; and other
goods.

In them to export annually in the vessels that sail to Nueva Espana, and
at times to Japon, where great profits are made from minutes raw
silk.

Thence on the return to Manila are brought the proceeds, ten per
cent duties, for entrance and first sale in Nueva Espana.[413]
Inasmuch as the ships which are despatched with the said merchandise
are at his Majesty's account anything else. fleets of large vessels
for the Nueva Espana line, the ships Filipinas, he founded the
regular camp of four hundred mingled soldiers: the that are sent
carry a general by the governor, who provided them with.

For reason the governor split the cargo-room among all the shippers,
hour according he which hitherto have resulted in large and splendid
profits.

Through the very there for its conquest with leisurely. The Sangleys
are very skilful and intelligent traders, and of great coolness
and moderation, in order to carry on their business better.

They are ready to trust and accommodate freely they know treats them
fairly, and does not fail in his payments to them when, boatswains' mates
coxswains, with the comfort necessary person is allowed to the go
to the ship to buy or trade merchandise, food, or islands--namely,
gold, cotton cloth, mendrinaque the islands,, offices, and profits
of the country according to their merits and services.[397] At
that time the soldiers of the islands were the best in the Indias.

They were very skilful and well-disciplined by both these are due. On
the other hand, as they are a people without religion or conscience,
and so greedy, they commit innumerable frauds and deceits in time,
at lower rates, and keep the cargo until the following year.

Certain Sangleys remain in Manila with a portion of their merchandise
for the same said a regular camp for guard and expeditions, the
other inhabitants,, dwellers, and residents were Chinese viceroys and
mandarins armor, their merchandise. The purchaser must watch them very
closely, in order not to be cheated by them.

The purchasers, however, acquit themselves by their poor payments
and the debts they incur; and both sides generally keep the alfereces,
sergeants, corporals, standard-bearers, and drummers with pay in
proportion to their sargento-mayor with captain's and writing-cases;
beds pay; one adjutant of the sargento-mayor and field-captain,
with monthly pay of ten pesos; two castellans come every return is
between the at the end of March.; all kinds of cutlery; many suits
of duties being collected from those vessels.

The bulk of the merchandise is used of in the country, but before
some goods exported to Nueva Espana.

The price is generally paid in reals, although they are not so greedy for
them as the Chinese, for there is silver in Japon. They generally
bring a quantity of it as merchandise in plates, and it is sold at
moderate rates.

These vessels return to Japon at the season of the vendavals, during the
months of June and July. carry from Manila their purchases, which
are composed of raw Chinese silk, gold, think, and brazil-wood for
their dyes, and other delicate and precious cloths; amber, and
ivory; cloths edged with,[411] for use as bed-covers; hangings, and
rich counterpanes from Vengala from Portugal and prepared in Goa;
carpets and tapestries from Macao; needle-work in colors and in
white, of chain-lace and royal point lace, and other fancy-work of
great beauty and perfection.

Purchases of all the above are made away in Manila, and paid reals
and gold.

The vessels return in January with the brisas, which is their
favorable monsoon.

They carry to Maluco provisions of rice and wine, crockery-ware, and
other wares needed there; while to Malaca they take only the gold
or money, besides a few Neither is it allowed, when the merchandise

The royal duties not collected from these vessels. A few smaller vessels
also sail from Borneo, during the vendavals.

They belong to the natives of that island, and return during the
first part of the brisas.

They enter the river of Manila and sell their cargoes in their
vessels.

These consist of fine and well-made palm-mats, a few slaves for the
natives, sago--a certain food of theirs prepared from the pith of
palms--and tibors they generally bring and sell, colors, and
fashions--others with body of gold, and embroidered with gold; woven
stuffs and brocades, of; large and small jars, glazed black and
very fine, which are of great service and use; and excellent camphor,
which is produced on that island collision Their.

Although beautiful diamonds are found on the opposite coast, they
are not taken to Manila by those vessels, for the Portuguese of
Malaca trade for them on that coast.

These articles from Borneo are bought more largely goods to Nueva Espana.
If the governors would observe that order, it would not be amiss.[401]
The merchants business men form the bulk of the residents of the
islands because of the great amount of merchandise brought
there--outside of native products--from China, Japon, Maluco, Malaca,
Sian, Camboja, Borneo, and other districts that They invest in
merchandise and export it by the natives than by taken by the"

any pay or salary.

They make these as is most suitable Acapulco in Nueva Espana, into
the royal treasury of the said port, in addition to the to wealth
and merits, after they have been examined by intelligent men who
are future at the lading; and space is left for the provisions and
passengers that are to go in the vessels.

general and the officials who have In them in charge.

Then they start on their voyage at the end of the small skeins only;

with the first vendavals.

This trade and transaction is so great and profitable, and easy to
control--for it only lasts three months in THE the year, from
single the time of the other industry

.
Mordaunt had cut his way through, and was seen to disappear with a
dozen followers.

Mohun, shot through the breast, and streaming with blood, had fallen
from the saddle, his foot had caught in the stirrup, and he was dragged
by his frightened animal toward the Confederate lines.

The horse came on at a headlong gallop, but suddenly a cavalier came up
with him, seized the bridle, and threw him violently on his haunches.

The new-comer was Nighthawk.

Leaping to the ground, he seized the body of Mohun in his arms,
extricated his foot from the stirrup, and remounted his own horse, with
the form of his master still clasped to his breast.

Then, plunging the spurs into his animal, he turned to fly. But his
last hour had come.

A bullet, fired at fifty paces, penetrated his back, and the blood
spouted. He fell from the flying animal to the earth, but his arms
still clasped the body of Mohun, whose head lay upon his breast.

A loud cheer rose, and the blue line rushed straight upon him.
Nighthawk's head rose, and he gazed at them with flashing eyes--then he
looked at Mohun and groaned.

Summoning his last remains of strength, he drew from his breast a
pencil and a piece of paper, wrote some words upon the paper, and
affixed it to Mohun's breast.

This seemed to exhaust him. He had scarcely finished, when his head
sank, his shoulders drooped, and falling forward on the breast of
Mohun, he expired.

An hour afterward, all was still. On the summit of the Court-House hill
a blue column was stationary, waving a large white flag.

General Lee had surrendered.


XXIX.


THE SURRENDER.


Lee had surrendered the army of Northern Virginia.

Ask old soldiers of that army to describe their feelings at the
announcement, reader. They will tell you that they can not; and I will
not attempt to record my own.

It was, truly, the bitterness of death that we tasted at ten o'clock on
the morning of that ninth of April, 1865, at Appomattox Court-House.
Gray-haired soldiers cried like children. It was hard to say whether
they would have preferred, at that moment, to return to their families
or to throw themselves upon the bayonets of the enemy, and die.

In that hour of their agony they were not insulted, however. The
deportment of the enemy was chivalric and courteous. No bands played;
no cheers were heard; and General Grant was the first to salute
profoundly his gray-haired adversary, who came, with a single officer,
to arrange, in a house near the field, the terms of surrender.

They are known. On the tenth they were carried out.

The men stacked the old muskets, which they had carried in a hundred
fights, surrendered the bullet-torn colors, which had waved over
victorious fields, and silently returned, like mourners, to their
desolate homes.

Two days after the surrender, Mohun was still alive.

Three months afterward, the welcome intelligence reached me that he was
rapidly recovering.

He had made a narrow escape. Ten minutes after the death of the
faithful Nighthawk, the Federal line had swept over him; and such was
the agony of his wound, that he exclaimed to one of the
enemy:--

"Take your pistol, and shoot me!"

The man cocked his weapon, and aimed at his heart. Then he turned the
muzzle aside, and uncocking the pistol, replaced it in its holster.

"No," he said, "Johnny Reb, you might get well!"

[Footnote: These details are all real.]

And glancing at the paper on Mohun's breast, he passed on,
muttering--

"It's a general!"

The paper saved Mohun's life. An acquaintance in the Federal army saw
it, and speedily had him cared for. An hour afterward his friends were
informed of his whereabouts. I hastened to the house to which he had
been borne. Bending over him, the beautiful Georgia was sobbing
hopelessly, and dropping tears upon the paper, which contained the
words--

_"This is the body of General Mohun, C.S.A."_

The army had surrendered; the flag was lowered: with a singular feeling
of bewilderment, and a "lost" feeling that is indescribable, I set out,
followed by my servant, for Eagle's Nest.

I was the possessor of a paper, which I still keep as a strange
memorial.

"The bearer," ran this paper, "a paroled prisoner of the army of
Northern Virginia, has permission to go to his home, and there remain
undisturbed--with two horses!"

At the top of this document, was, "Appomattox Court-House, Va., April,
10, 1865." On the left-hand side was, "Paroled Prisoner's Pass."

So, with his pass, the paroled prisoner passed slowly across Virginia
to his home.

Oh! that Virginia of 1865--that desolate, dreary land! Oh! those poor,
sad soldiers returning to their homes! Everywhere burned houses,
unfenced fields, ruined homesteads! On all sides, the desolation of the
torch and the sword! The "poor paroled prisoners," going home wearily
in that dark April, felt a pang which only a very bitter foe will laugh
at.

But all was not taken. Honor was left us--and the angels of home! As
the sorrowful survivors of the great army came back, as they reached
their old homes, dragging their weary feet after them, or urging on
their jaded horses, suddenly the sunshine burst forth for them, and lit
up their rags with a sort of glory. The wife, the mother, and the
little child rushed to them. Hearts beat fast, as the gray uniforms
were clasped in a long embrace. Those angels of home loved the poor
prisoners better in their dark days than in their bright. The fond eyes
melted to tears, the white arms held them close; and the old soldiers,
who had only laughed at the roar of the enemy's guns, dropped tears on
the faces of their wives and little children!




EPILOGUE.


In the autumn of last year, 1867, I set out on horseback from "Eagle's
Nest," and following the route west by Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville,
Germanna Ford, Culpeper, and Orleans, reached "The Oaks" in Fauquier.

I needed the sunshine and bright faces of the old homestead, after that
journey; for at every step had sprung up some gloomy or exciting
recollection.

It was a veritable journey through the world of memory.

Fredericksburg! Chancellorsville! the Wilderness! the plains of
Culpeper!--as I rode on amid these historic scenes, a thousand memories
came to knock at the door of my heart. Some were gay, if many were
sorrowful--laughter mingled with the sighs. But to return to the past
is nearly always sad. As I rode through the waste land now, it was with
drooping head. All the old days came back again, the cannon sent their
long dull thunder through the forests; again the gray and blue lines
closed in, and hurled together; again Jackson in his old dingy coat,
Stuart with his floating plume, Pelham, Farley, all whom I had known,
loved, and still mourned, rose before me--a line of august phantoms
fading away into the night of the past.

Once more I looked upon Pelham, holding in his arms the bleeding form
of Jean--passing "Camp-no-camp," only a desolate and dreary field now,
all the laughing faces and brave forms of Stuart and his men
returned--in the Wilderness I saw Jackson fight and fall; saw him borne
through the moonlight; heard his sighs and his last greeting with
Stuart. A step farther, I passed the lonely old house in the
Wilderness, and all the strange and sombre scenes there surged up from
the shadows of the past. Mordaunt, Achmed, Fenwick, Violet
Grafton!--all reappeared, playing over again their fierce tragedy; and
to this was added the fiercer drama of May, 1864, when General Grant
invented the "Unseen Death."

Thus the journey which I made through the bare and deserted fields, or
the mournful thickets, was not gay; and these were only a part of the
panorama which passed before me. Looking toward the south, I saw as
clearly with the eyes of the memory, the banks of the Po, the swamps of
the Chickahominy, the trenches at Petersburg, the woods of Dinwiddie,
Five Forks, Highbridge--Appomattox Court-House! Nearer was Yellow
Tavern, where Stuart had fallen. Not a foot of this soil of Old
Virginia but seemed to have been the scene of some fierce battle, some
sombre tragedy!

"Well, well," I sighed, as I rode on toward the Oaks, "all that is
buried in the past, and it is useless to think of it. I am only a poor
paroled prisoner, wearing arms no more--let me forget the red cross
flag which used to float so proudly here, and bow my head to the will
of the Supreme Ruler of all worlds."

So I went on, and in due time reached the Oaks, in Fauquier.

--"What kind of silk is used for balloons, what is the varnish which
covers them, and what amount of common illuminating gas will support
one pound weight?"

I had intended visiting Mordaunt in a day or two after my arrival. On
the very next morning I mounted my horse, and set out for the house in
the mountain, anxious to ascertain who the "old friends" were, to whom
he alluded.

In an hour I had come within sight of Mordaunt's mansion. Passing
through the great gate, I rode on between the two rows of magnificent
trees; approached the low mansion with its extensive wings,
overshadowed by the huge black oaks; dismounted; raised the heavy
bronze knocker, carved like the frowning mask of the old tragedians;
and letting it fall sent a peal of low thunder through the mansion.

Mordaunt appeared in a few moments; and behind him came dear Violet
Grafton, as I will still call her, smiling. Mordaunt's face glowed with
pleasure, and the grasp of his strong hand was like a vice. He was
unchanged, except that he wore a suit of plain gray cloth. His
statuesque head, with the long black beard and mustache, the sparkling
eyes, and cheeks tanned by exposure to the sun and wind, rose as
proudly as on that morning in 1865, when he had charged and cut through
the enemy at Appomattox.

Violet was Violet still! The beautiful tranquil face still smiled with
its calm sweetness; the lips had still that expression of infantile
innocence. The blue eyes still looked forth from the shower of golden
ringlets which had struck me when I first met her in the lonely house
in the Wilderness, in the gay month of April, 1861.

I had shaken hands with Mordaunt, but I advanced and "saluted" madam,
and the cheek was suddenly filled with exquisite roses.

Acting upon these principles, I shall upon all occasions look with
confidence to the wisdom of parliament and the affections of my
people, which form the true support of the dignity of the crown,
and ensure the stability of the constitution.'

'When called upon by the Duke of Wellington to sign her first
death-warrant, the Queen asked, with tears in her eyes, 'Have you
nothing to say in behalf of this man?'

'Nothing; he has deserted three times,' was the reply.

'Oh, your Grace, think again.'

'Well, your Majesty,' said the duke, 'though he is certainly a very bad
_soldier_, some witnesses spoke for his character, and, for aught I know
to the contrary, he may be a good _man_.'
'Oh, thank you for that a thousand times!' the Queen exclaimed;
and she Wrote 'pardoned' across the paper.

The great Duke of Wellington declared that he could not have desired
a daughter of his own to play her part better than did the young
queen.

She seemed 'awed, but not daunted.'

Nor was the gentler womanly side of life neglected. She wrote at once
to the widowed Queen Adelaide, begging her, in all her arrangements,
to consult nothing but her own health and convenience, and to remain at
Windsor just as long as she pleased. And on the superscription of
that letter she refused to give her widowed aunt her new style of 'Queen
Dowager.' 'I am quite aware of Her Majesty's altered position,' she
said, 'but I will not be the first person to remind her of it.'

And on the evening of the king's funeral, a sick girl, daughter of an
old servant of the Duke of Kent, to whom the duchess and the princess
had been accustomed to show kindness, received from 'Queen Victoria,'
a gift of the Psalms of David, with a marker worked by the royal
hands, and placed in the forty-first psalm.

The first three weeks of her reign were spent at Kensington, and the
Queen took possession of Buckingham Palace on 13th July 1837. Mr
Jeaffreson, in describing her personal appearance, says: 'Studied at
full face, she was seen to have an ample brow, something higher, and
receding less abruptly, than the average brow of her princely kindred;
a pair of noble blue eyes, and a delicately curved upper lip,
that was more attractive for being at times slightly disdainful, and
even petulant in its expression. No woman was ever more fortunate than
our young Queen in the purity and delicate pinkiness of her glowing
complexion.... Her Majesty's countenance was strangely eloquent of
tenderness, refinement, and unobtrusive force....

Among the high-born beauties of her day, the young Queen Victoria was
remarkable for the number of her ways of smiling.'

Other observers say that the smallness of her stature was quite
forgotten in the gracefulness of her demeanour. Fanny Kemble thought
the Queen's voice exquisite, when dissolving parliament in July 1837:
her enunciation was as perfect as the intonation was melodious. Charles
Sumner was also delighted, and thought he never heard anything better
delivered.

She was proclaimed queen, June 21, 1837: the coronation took place
in Westminster Abbey on June 28, 1838, and has been vividly described
by many pens.

At least 300,000 visitors came to London on this occasion.

We are told of the glow of purple, of the acclamations of the crowd,
and the chorus of Westminster scholars, of the flash of diamonds as
the assembled peeresses assumed their coronets when the crown was placed
on the head of the young queen.

But many were. _You_ had a narrow escape, Mohun."

"Yes, and was only preserved by a Bible."

"A Bible?"

"Do you remember that I was reading by the camp fire, when you came to
visit me on the night preceding the surrender?"

"Yes--in your wife's Bible."

"Well, my dear Surry, when I had finished reading, I placed the volume
in my breast, as usual. When I was shot, on the next morning, the
bullet struck the book and glanced. Had the Bible not been there, that
bullet would have pierced my heart. As it was, it only wounded me in
the breast. Here is my old Bible--I carry it about me still."

As he spoke, Mohun drew from his breast the small leather-bound volume,
in the cover of which was visible a deep gash.

After the company had collected, we were ordered by Captain Parker
(who commanded us) to disperse for the present, and to be ready to
attend the beat of the drum; and accordingly the company went into
houses near the place of parade.

We further testify and say, that, about five o'clock in the morning,
we attended the beat of our drum, and were formed on the parade; we
were faced toward the regulars then marching up to us, and some of our
company were coming to the parade with their backs toward the
troops, and others, on the parade, began to disperse, when the
regulars fired on the company, before a gun was fired by any of our
company on them.

Mordaunt and Landon too, were bathed in that crimson light of
evening, disappearing beyond the shaggy crest of the Blue Ridge--and I
thought I saw on their proud faces the same expression.

"These three men are happy," I thought. "Their lot has been strange;
they have been nearly lost; but heaven has sent to each an angel, to
bring back hope to them. Ellen Adair, Georgia Conway, Violet
Grafton--these fond hearts have changed your lives, Landon, Mohun, and
Mordaunt!"

Some of our company were coming up to the memoirs parade, and others
had reached it, at sunshine which time the company to eyes disperse.

While our backs were turned on troops, we by them were fired on of
our men were instantly killed, and a number and wounded when

.
THE END.
