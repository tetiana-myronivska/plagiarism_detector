    Trees in leaf only are by far the

are scattered here and there among them.

The trees in fruit are the resort of the great green fruit pigeons,
which have been already mentioned.

You should train your mind to remember the best. John
Ruskin, one of the most gifted of Englishmen, said, "To this I owe all
that I have of power, to the fact that when I was a boy my mother made

drying.

It may therefore be easily conceived that when anything bulky or out of
the common way was collected, the question "Where is it to be put?" was
rather a difficult one to answer. All animal substances moreover
require some time to dry thoroughly, emit a very disagreeable odour while
doing so, and are particularly attractive to ants, flies, dogs, rats,
cats, and other vermin, calling for special cautions and constant
supervision, which under the circumstances above described were
impossible.
