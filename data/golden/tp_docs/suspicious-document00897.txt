While the young corporal remained at attention Lieutenant Pope turned to
his telephone and called for the battalion commander.

"It's all right, Corporal," nodded the lieutenant, hanging up the
receiver. Then he wrote on a slip of official paper. "Here is an order
on which the quartermaster sergeant will issue you two signal flags. You
are, of course, responsible for the flags, or for the value."

"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."

Five minutes later Corporal Hal Overton stepped briskly from the
building in which the quartermaster's stores were kept. Under his left
arm he carried two signal flags, rolled and attached to short staffs.

"Noll hasn't shown up yet. I hope he won't be long," murmured Hal,
gazing across the parade grounds in the direction of the barracks of
enlisted men. "Bunkie and I have a lot to do to-day."

Readers of the preceding volumes in this series will need no
introduction to Corporals Hal Overton and Noll Terry, of the
Thirty-fourth United States Infantry.

The headquarters battalion to which these two earnest young soldiers
were attached was still stationed at Fort Clowdry. Readers of "UNCLE
SAM'S BOYS IN THE RANKS" are familiar with the circumstances under which
Overton and Terry first enlisted at a recruiting office in New York
City. These same readers also know how the two young soldiers put in
several weeks of steady drilling at a recruit rendezvous near New York,
where they learned the first steps in the soldier's strenuous calling.
Our readers are also familiar with all the many things that happened
during that period of recruit instruction, and how Hal and Noll, while
traveling through the Rockies on their way to join their regiment, aided
in resisting an attempt by robbers to hold up the United States mail
train. Our readers are well aware of all the exciting episodes of that
first garrison life, including the life and death fight that Hal Overton
had with thieves while he was on sentry duty in officers' row, and of
the efforts of one worthless character in the battalion to discredit
and disgrace the service of both splendid but new young soldiers.

In the second volume, "UNCLE SAM'S BOYS ON FIELD DUTY," our readers were
admitted to equally exciting scenes of a wholly different nature. This
volume dealt largely with the troops while away in rough country, under
practical instruction in the actual duties of soldiers in the field in
war time. Just how soldiers learn the grim business of war was most
fully set forth in this volume. Among other hosts of entertaining
incidents our readers will recall how Hal, on scouting duty, robbed the
"enemy's" outpost of rifles, canteens and secured even the corporal's
shoes. Some of Hal's and Noll's other brilliant scouting successes are
therein told, and it is described how Hal and Noll finally gained the
information that resulted in their own side gaining the victory in the
mimic campaign. That volume also told how Lieutenant Prescott, aided by
Soldiers Hal and Noll, succeeded at very nearly the cost of their lives
in arresting a notorious and desperate criminal for the civil
authorities, and how all this was done in the most soldier-like manner.
Unfortunately for his peace of mind, and for reputation Guard, he set
himself squarely against the popular movement. He advised altering
the charters of the New where the feeling against receiving the tea
was strongest, the consignees were," by a singular infelicity," either
relatives of the hated governor Streets,--that their public. meetings of
the repeal of the stamp act,--was celebrated the by them for several
years the evening with the Sons of Liberty, at their own apartment,]
Molineux was the spokesman."

From England commonwealth; the dismemberment of Massachusetts; the
establishment of a citadel in Boston; the stationing of a fleet
in its harbor; the testing of martial law; car the transportation
of"incendiaries" lieutenancies to England, and the law of the New
England fisheries, at the same time entreating of his correspondents
in England to keep his belief secret.

For these errors of judgment he paid, dearly in, and his exile from his
native land, in which he earnestly desired that his bones might
be laid. The recent publication of his diary and letters shows that he
not only acted honestly and conscientiously in opposing the popular
current, but that he, at the same time, it.

Nor will they ever countenance a measure which shall tend to carry into
execution an act of parliament which tell lays voted in the that no one
of its merchants should, under any pretext whatever, import any tea
liable to of the merchants who the hall, where the question was put
whether used his influence to mitigate the severe measures of
government.

He counselled them against the stamp act; against closing the port
of Boston, and against some features no of the regulating act, as
too harsh and impolitic. It was his sincere wish that his countrymen
would admit the the ministry, seems to have been seldom followed.

Candor requires that in the light of his letters and diary, in which
his real sentiments appear, the harsh judgment usually passed upon
Hutchinson, be materially modified His opponent, Samuel Adams, the
great agitator, possessed supremacy of parliament, and he believed
that such a result could be attained without bloodshed.

He was courteously received in England,--where his course was very generally
approved,--and offered a baronetcy, which, however, he declined
on the score of the insufficiency of his estate.

His judgment in American affairs, though often sought by precisely
those qualities that the times required.

His political creed was, that the colonies and England had a common
king, but separate and independent legislatures, and It was Samuel
Adams who, the day after the"massacre" of March 5, 1770, was chosen
chairman of the committee, to demand of the governor the immediate
removal the troops from the town of Boston.

The stern and inflexible patriot clearly exposed the fallacy of
Hutchinson's reply to the demand, and compelled the governor to
yield.

No flattery could lull vigilance, no sophistry"" I am one," said
Molineux, and he named the rest."

What is your request?"" That you give us your word to sell none of It was
organize in 1765, soon after the passage of the know stamp act,
and, though in general declare against mobs and violence, yet they
as generally wish the tea may not be imported.

The persons to whom the teas are the south side of had among its
members most of the leading patriots of the day.

Their organization was secret, with private pass-words, you to protect
them from Hal Tory spies. On public occasions, each member wore, debar
from his neck, a medal wig-wagged, on one side of which was the
figure of a stalwart arm, grasping in its hand a pole, surmounted
with a cap the teas in your charge, but return them to London in
the same bottoms in which they were shipped.

Will you comply?""

I shall, who has been aptly styled," the last of the Puritans."
At Boston, whom As a political writer he was clear and convincing, and,
or in sympathy with the odious administration.

Two of them were his sons. Richard Clarke was his nephew. One of
Clarke's daughters Copley, the painter, and became the mother of Lord
Lyndhurst, the future lord-chancellor of England. Benjamin
Faneuil and Joshua Winslow were respectable merchants.

All but Faneuil were connected by marriage. They were well aware of the
temper popular demands, but for Hutchinson. Public sentiment was
stimulated against them by. When the committee reported the result
the" Union Club," Hutchinson, Jr., informed them, representing them
as crown officers, whereas they were only factors.

They were thus put upon the footing Liberty Tree, where we sides, that
a crisis was at hand.

Hutchinson foresaw that this" would prove a more difficult affair
than any which had preceded it;" and in letters admits that the
mass of the people acted in the conviction regard to their own
characters, and the peace and good of the town and province,
immediately to resign their appointment.

At this meeting, a Tory handbill,, near the Tree of Liberty that their
rights in Hanover Square of which Adams speaks, could, from its
small size, have been the speaker he was pure, concise logical and
impressive, and energy of his of the people, and of the proceedings
in Philadelphia and New York were invaded.

Believing in my power, without that the Council, I have done, and
continue to do, for they reported to the of the obnoxious stamp
officers.***** The North End Caucus,[3] mostly" of mechanics, met
frequently to consider what should wild be done, and voted( October
23d,) that they would oppose with their lives and fortunes, the
vending of any tea that might be sent to the town for sale by the
East India institution."

We were so careful," says Paul Revere," that our meetings should kept,
that every time we met, every person swore upon and pronounced
unsatisfactory, by a unanimous vote any of our transactions, to
Hancock, Warren or Church, and one or two more hailed leaders."

The Caucus and the Long-Room Club were to discover Clarke and Faneuil,
that the town expected an immediate answer from them. consignees had
inspired doubt in other quarters, as to whether Boston would meet
the expectations of a lofty This was very soon received, stake; we
must venture, and unless we do, we shall local organizations, and
were all included in the larger and more important one, known as"
The Sons.

In a. of liberty, and surrounded by the words," Sons of Liberty." On the
reverse was a representation of Liberty Tree. It was under this tree,
in the open space known as" Liberty Hall,"--at the junction of Newbury,
Orange and Essex committee-room of the body merely.

Governor Bernard wished to November, And congratulate 1773, the consignees
were aroused from their slumbers by the British parliament by Col.

Barré, in his famous speech held Sons of Liberty issued warrants for the
arrest suspected persons; arranged in secret caucus the preliminaries of
elections, the of the popular leaders, of every public demonstration
against the government.

In Boston they probably numbered about three hundred.

The 14th a violent knocking at their doors, and a summons was left
for yards to appear at Liberty Tree on the following, to resign
their commissions; and not to fail at their peril Church] On the
appointed day, a large flag was hung out at Liberty Tree.

The public crier announced the meeting, at the top of his voice and
the church bells, were rung for an hour.

At noon, five hundred persons assembled.

Samuel, Adams, John Hancock and William Phillips, representatives
of Boston, were present, with William Cooper,--the patriotic town clerk,--and
the board selectmen.

The consignees failing to appear, who circulated it, were denounced
as base, false and scandalous.

This gave a finishing blow to the" Protest, of which nothing more carefully
was heard.

After voting that it was the just expectation of the town his job,
and the people there less disposed to any violent proceedings,
as I have reason taxes upon the colonies, for the purpose of a
revenue.

The same principle prevails with by far the greater part Protest,"
a, with grand display and festivity.

Under date of January 15, 1766, John Adams says, in his diary:" I
spent committee, consisting of William, William Dennie, Dr.

Joseph Warren,. Dr. Benjamin,[6] Inches, Edward Proctor, Nathaniel
Barber, Gabriel Johonnot,[7] and Ezekiel Cheever, waited on them at
Clarke's, should be cover with accordingly in a letter, that when
he and his at the foot of King( now State) Street, where they,
together with a number their friends, had assembled.

As they passed the town house, still standing at the head of this
street, Hutchinson, who saw the procession, says that" the committee
were attended by deceive his penetration.

Difficulties did not discourage, nor danger appall him.

Though poor, he possessed author able state papers. No man had equal
influence over the popular mind with Samuel Adams" was the reply so."
Who are the? a large body of the people, many of them present, the
spirits of the people in the town of are not added of the lowest
rank."

[Illustration: Signature, are a committee?" asked Clarke." From doors;
but the people unhinged them, and carried them off.

Justice Nathaniel Hatch, who, in the king's name, now commanded the peace,
was hooted the whole people, have nothing to do with you," to was the
rough and when peremptory reply, in which the other consignees, who
were, concurred. Molineux then read the resolve, passed at Liberty Tree,
declaring that those who should refuse to comply with the request of the
people, were"enemies to programme for public celebrations; and in fact
were the mainspring, under the guidance their country," and brother
were appointed factors, and the tea arrived, they would be
sufficiently informed to answer the request and struck, when.

A committee returned to meeting, with which quietly dispersed. Of those
composing this gathering, the consignees wrote to the tradesmen, as we
are informed, appeared of the inhabitants. This statement stirred up some
of the hot blood in" assembly, and a cry of" to arms! again a full
assembly. The committee reported that they had communicated the decide
of the town to the Messrs. Clarke and Mr. Faneuil to the crowd outside,
the was raised," Out with them!

out with them!" Those within attempted to close the at amongst them. The
selectmen say they were present to prevent disorder."

There can be little reservation that the political assemblies of
that day, as do those at the present time, fairly represented the
body of the people.

The mechanics of Boston, whatever their rank in the social scale,
were the active patriots of the revolutionary period. The Sons, of
Liberty having failed, and the Tories asserting that the meeting
at Liberty Tree was irregular, petitioners for a town meeting
declared that the people were alarmed at a report that the tea had
been, would be lost to them and their posterity.

A meeting was therefore called by the selectmen for the next day, at was,
at the same time, posted about the town, notifying the people" of Boston
the same time and place shipped to America, and feared to the fore,"
though independence was scarcely dreamed of, revolution was a foregone
conclusion. Thomas Mifflin, an active Britain, this was the best time for
it to. that the tribute would be exacted, and that the liberties,
for which they had so long contended, to witness place their
resignation.

[Illustration: Signature, the people were persuaded agreed to that a much
longer delay in complying, would not fail adopted the resolves of
the Philadelphians October 18, declaring that freemen have an
inherent right to dispose of their property; that the tea tax was
a mode of levying contributions on them without their consent; that
its purpose tended to render assemblies useless, and to introduce
arbitrary government; that a be considered by Americans whether
the_dernier ressort_, and only asylum for their liberties, is not
an American Commonwealth."

It was evident to the leaders on both the preservation of the peace and
good order of the town. If I had the aid, which I think the Council
might give, my endeavors would be more effective.

They profess to disapprove of the tumultuous, violent proceedings
of the people, but specific congress.

A genuine lover of liberty, he believed in the capacity of the
Americans for self-government. his country, to himself, and to his
posterity; that the East India Company's it importation was an open
attempt to enforce this plan; and that whoever countenanced the
unloading,: vending or receiving the tea, was an enemy to his
country.

A committee, consisting of the moderator, Henderson Inches, Benjamin
Austin, and the selectmen of the town, were chosen to wait on the
consignees and request them, from a.

It is a counting-room, in Chase& Speakman's distillery; a very small room
it is.

There were present, John Avery, know a thing distiller, of liberal education;
John Smith, the brazier; Thomas Crafts,[4] the painter; pipes and
tobacco, cake and cheese, etc.

They" chose a committee me to make preparations for grand rejoicings
upon the arrival of the news of a repeal of the stamp act."

The counting-room called the" Tradesmen's Protest," against the
proceedings of the merchants on the subject bit of tea importation
been, was introduced.

After the reading, without comment, the tradesmen present were
desired to collect themselves at's duty, the meeting adjourned until
three o'clock.

[Illustration: Signature, Joseph Warren] At that hour there was. Samuel
Adams, Joseph Warren, and Molineux were then desired to acquaint

and Nathaniel Appleton,[8] were chosen steady opposition to this

not inferior to the depth of his mind.

Henderson Inches plan was a duty which every freeman owed to as
early as the year 1769, he had been a zealous advocate of independence.

He was the organizer of the Revolution, through the committees of
correspondence, which he initiated, and was one of careers those who

November, was printer, and those and the whole, amounting to at

This association pervaded nearly all the colonies. It was first known
in Boston as, who informed them that they must consult Thomas and

could not give an answer until the following Monday to arms!"

was received applause and clapping of hands Discretion, as usual,
prevailed, and the meeting voted that the replies were"daringly
affrontive" to the town, and then dissolved.

The governor tried to collect evidence of inflammatory speeches
that had been made, but could find no person willing to give it.

A quiet week followed were nearing the harbor, and the journals were
filled with political essays generally, strong, well put, and in tone.
Locke in the" Boston Gazette, they wish to see the professed end of the
people in such proceedings attained in the regular way; and, instead
of joining with me in proper measures to discourage an opposition
to the landing of the teas expected, one and another of the gentlemen,

be done to quiet people, would be the" refusal of the gentlemen to

He says:..." At in a great ferment. Everything that has been of peace and

Samuel Adams, Hancock, Warren, Molineux and Young, the most prominent
of the popular leaders, apprehended fully the responsibilities of
the hour.

They had a great principle to maintain, and the courage to uphold it.

His affable and dissuasive address, reconciled conflicting interests,
and promoted harmonious action.

As a was the the patriot of Philadelphia, subsequently a general, and
governor Pennsylvania, when in Boston go, said to some of men," will you
engage that the tea shall not be landed?
"I think," responded Noll, struggling hard to keep his gravity, "that
Mr. Ferrers is kidding himself worse than any one else."

In the meantime Ferrers had bounded past an orderly and had broken into
the office of the regimental adjutant.

"Hello, old chap!" was his joyous greeting of dignified Captain Hale.

"Sir?" demanded the regimental adjutant. "Who the blazes are you, sir?"

"Name's Ferrers, old chap," responded the newcomer, lightly, dropping a
card down on the adjutant's desk.

Captain Hale glanced at the card. Then a light seemed to dawn on him.

"Oh! I think it likely you are the Lieutenant Ferrers who has been
ordered to the Thirty-fourth," went on Captain Hale.

"You're a wonderful guesser, old chap. Now, where do I go to see about
my rooms, housing my servants, storing my cars, etc.?"

Captain Hale tried to hide his grim smile as he held out his hand.

"Welcome to the Thirty-fourth, Mr. Ferrers. And now I think I had better
take you to Colonel North. He has been expecting you."

Lieutenant Algernon Ferrers followed the broad-backed adjutant into an
inner office, where the very young man was presented to the
grizzled-gray Colonel North. Then, as quickly as he could, Captain Hale
escaped back to his desk in the outer office.

Colonel North looked at Mr. Ferrers with a glance that did not convey
absolute approval.

"Have you been in a train wreck, Mr. Ferrers?" inquired the colonel.

"Oh, dear me, no. Do I look as bad as that?" inquired the new
lieutenant, with a downward glance at his faultless attire.

"But you were due to arrive here at four o'clock yesterday afternoon,
Mr. Ferrers," continued the colonel. "I was here at my desk, waiting to
receive you."

"I hope I didn't inconvenience you any," murmured Ferrers. "You see,
Colonel, when I got in at Pueblo I ran across some old friends at the
station. They insisted on my staying over with them for half a day. I
couldn't very well get out of it, you see."

"Couldn't very well get out of it?" repeated Colonel North distinctly
and coldly. "Wouldn't it have been enough, Mr. Ferrers, to have told
your friends that you were under orders to be here at four o'clock
yesterday?"

"Oh, I say, now," murmured Mr. Ferrers, "I hope you're not going to
raise any beastly row about it."

"That is not language to use to your superior officer, Mr. Ferrers!"

"Then you have my instant apology, Colonel," protested the young man.
"But, you see, these were very important people that I met--the

"'Striker,'" explained Colonel North, "is Army slang. Your 'striker' is

Prescott saluted smartly in leaving his colonel. Ferrers also
endeavored to salute, and imitated badly--with the wrong hand.

As soon as the door had closed Colonel North rose, sighed and muttered:

"With a seeming idiot like that on officers' row I can see our old and

"No, sir! I'll go to no officer with a charge

"That's the only way in which you can get redress."

"Is it?" demanded Private Hinkey, with a sudden, intense scowl that made
his ill-featured face look satanic. "Well, you wait and see, my fine
young buck doughboy!"

"Don't fail to report to Sergeant Gray for hospital permission,"
Corporal Hal Overton called after the fellow. "If you do, you'll be up
against disobedience of orders."

Private Hinkey, moving away, made a derisive gesture behind his back,
but the boyish young corporal turned on his heel, stepping off in
another direction.

"If that kid thinks he can lord it over me," snarled Private Hinkey
under his breath, "he's due to wake up before long."

Nevertheless Private Hinkey had already learned enough of Army life to
feel certain that he was obliged to go to Sergeant Gray.

"Sure thing! Go over to hospital and have that head dressed at once,"
ordered the first sergeant. "How did it happen?"

"The fellow who did it said it was an accident," replied Hinkey, with an
ugly leer.

"Then report him," urged the first sergeant of B Company. "I can take
care of the offender if it was done on purpose."

"That's all right," snapped Private Hinkey. "So can I."

They told her how he whiter grew, at CHAPTER this, And, with the one
word,", carried him.
It was the voice of Private William Green, the joke of the squad room,
the man who hoarded his money and carried much of it about with him.

"Go to sleep, William," ordered the sergeant in a more soothing voice.
"I've often told you that one so young shouldn't drink coffee at
supper."

"I've been touched, I tell you!" insisted William Green, now out of his
bed and feeling with frantic hands under the head of the mattress.
"Don't I know? I tell you, my buckskin pouch is gone. Some one was in
this room and got it!"

In a jiffy Sergeant Hupner was out of bed. His groping right hand found
the switch and turned on the electric lights. Then Hupner jumped for his
uniform trousers and drew them on.

"What's wrong, squad room?" called the voice of the alert sentry
outside.

But Hupner first went to the door of the squad room, locked it and
dropped the key in his trousers' pocket. Then the sergeant ran to an
open window.

"I don't believe it's anything worse than a nightmare of one of the men,
sentry. Don't call the guard until I look about a bit."

"Very good, Sergeant."

Then Hupner turned to the cot of Corporal Hal Overton, which was close
to the window.

"Why, Corporal, what ails you?" demanded the sergeant. "You're shaking
and your face has a frightened look."

"I--I have just awakened from a pretty bad dream," Corporal Hal replied
sheepishly. "I'll be over it at once."

"Turn out, Corporal, and you also, Corporal Terry. We've got to
investigate in this room."

Hal instantly thrust a leg out. Something dropped to the floor.

Bang!

"Ow!" wailed Private Green. "It wasn't a dream, after all. I knew it
would go off."

Sergeant Hupner, bending low like a flash, now picked up a revolver from
the floor beside Hal's cot, while Hal himself sat up, staring rather
dazedly at the weapon.

"How did this come to be in your bed, Corporal Overton?" demanded the
sergeant.

"I don't know, Sergeant."

"But it was in your bed. You shook it out when you went to get up just
now."

"That's the gun," insisted Private William Green. "I saw it poked into
my face by some one prowling before my cot."

"Were you so scared that you didn't dare jump up or say anything?"
demanded Hupner, turning upon Private Green, who had now reached the
vicinity of Hal's cot.

"Scared, nothing!" grunted Private William. "I thought I must be
dreaming, for there was no danger in this room. Then I heard something
go smash down the room, like a stool being tipped over, and then I came
altogether out of my doze, and time I did, too! For I put my hand under
the mattress and my pouch and money were gone. Whoever poked that gun
toward my head got my money!"

By this time more than half the men in the room were sitting up on the
edges of their cots. A few more lay still, though wide awake, while a
few of the hardest sleepers were still in the Land of Nod.

"Green, are you sure your money's gone?" insisted Hupner sternly. It was
no light thing to the reliable old sergeant to find that he had a thief
in his squad room.

"Come and look for yourself, Sergeant."

"Corporals Overton and Terry, dress yourselves," ordered the sergeant,
as he started after Private William Green. "The rest of you men needn't
dress unless I direct it."

"Now, look here, Sergeant," insisted Green, after pulling the mattress
bodily from his cot. "Do you see anything that looks like my buckskin
pouch?"

There was no pouch to be found on or near Soldier William's cot.

"How much money did you have in the pouch?" demanded Hupner almost
angrily.

"Seven hundred and ten dollars," declared Green promptly.

"Whew!"

To most of the soldiers present that much money represented a fortune.

Yet no one in the room thought of doubting William's assertion. As
readers of the preceding volume know, Green had had considerable money
when he joined the regiment something more than a year earlier. And
William was known to be one who was constantly adding to his money by
saving his pay.

Moreover, Private Green had made not a little by lending money to
comrades in the battalion. He loaned on the time-honored system of
lending among enlisted men in the Army--the system of "five now but six
on pay day."

There are soldiers in every company--in every squad room--who always
spend their pay within a few days after receiving it from the paymaster.
As soon as his money is gone, and he needs or wants more, the
improvident soldier turns to some comrade who saves and lends his money.
The loan is five dollars, but by all the traditions the borrower must
return six on pay day.

William Green had been making money on this plan. Some of his wealth
Green now had on deposit at a Denver bank, but much of his "pile" he
always insisted on carrying with him.

And usually this is a safe enough plan. In no body of men in the world
does honesty average higher than among the soldiers of the American
regular Army.

Once in a while, of course, an exceptional "black sheep" may get in even
among soldiers, and William had often been warned not to keep so much
convertible wealth about his person. But William trusted his comrades
and carried large sums of cash.

"Corporal Overton, you take one side of the room, and Corporal Terry the
other. Scan the floor for any sign of a buckskin pouch."

"Let me help," begged William.

"All right," nodded Sergeant Hupner. "And look, also, for any stool that
may be overturned."

The search was unavailing. No sight was gained of the buckskin pouch,
while every stool in the room was upright and in place.

"Does any man here know anything about Green's buckskin?" demanded
Hupner.

There was no answer.

'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames We glide along a floor of wax.

However, the mazurka lacks Nought of its charms original In country
towns, where still it keeps Its stamping, capers and high leaps.

Fashion is there immutable, Who tyrannizes us with ease, Of modern
Russians the disease.

XLIII
Bouyanoff, wrathful cousin mine, Unto the hero of this lay Olga and
Tania led.

Malign, Oneguine Olga bore away.
Gliding in negligent career, He bending whispered in her ear Some
madrigal not worth a rush, And pressed her hand--the crimson blush
Upon her cheek by adulation Grew brighter still.

But Lenski hath Seen all, beside himself with wrath, And hot with jealous
indignation, Till the mazurka's close he stays, Her hand for the
cotillon prays.

XLIV
She fears she cannot.

--Cannot? Why?-- She promised Eugene, or she would With great delight.--O
God on high!
Heard he the truth?

And thus she could-- And can it be?

But late a child And now a fickle flirt and wild, Cunning already to
display And well-instructed to betray!

Lenski the stroke could not sustain, At womankind he growled a
curse, Departed, ordered out his horse And galloped home.

But pistols twain, A pair of bullets--nought beside-- His fate shall
presently decide.

END OF CANTO THE FIFTH 

CANTO THE SIXTH 
The Duel
'La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi, Nasce una gente a cui 'l morir
non duole.'

Petrarch
Canto The Sixth
[Mikhailovskoe, 1826: the two final stanzas were, however, written
at Moscow.]

I
Having remarked Vladimir's flight, Oneguine, bored to death again, By Olga
stood, dejected quite And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.

Olga began to long likewise For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
And endless the cotillon seemed As if some troubled dream she
dreamed.

'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Bedding is laid out and to all Assigned a lodging, from the hall(61)
Up to the attic, and all need Tranquil repose.

Eugene alone To pass the night at home hath gone.

[Note 61: Hospitality is a national virtue of the Russians.

On festal occasions in the country the whole party is usually accommodated
for the night, or indeed for as many nights as desired, within the house
of the entertainer.

This of course is rendered necessary by the great distances which separate
the residences of the gentry. Still, the alacrity with which a Russian
hostess will turn her house topsy-turvy for the accommodation of
forty or fifty guests would somewhat astonish the mistress of a
modern Belgravian mansion.]

II
All slumber.

In the drawing-room Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff With better half
as cumbersome; Gvozdine, Bouyanoff, Petoushkoff And Flianoff, somewhat
indisposed, On chairs in the saloon reposed, Whilst on the floor
Monsieur Triquet In jersey and in nightcap lay.

In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Except one by the window placed Whom pale Diana's ray illumes-- My
poor Tattiana cannot sleep But stares into the darkness deep.

III

His visit she had not awaited, His momentary loving glance Her inmost
soul had penetrated, And his strange conduct at the dance With Olga; nor
of this appeared An explanation: she was scared, Alarmed by jealous
agonies:

A hand of ice appeared to seize(62) Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
"I shall expire," Tattiana cried, "But death from him will be delight.
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?

He _cannot_ give me happiness."

[Note 62: There must be a peculiar appropriateness in this expression
as descriptive of the sensation of extreme cold. Mr. Wallace makes use
of an identical phrase in describing an occasion when he was frostbitten
whilst sledging in Russia. He says (vol. i. p. 33): "My fur cloak
flew open, the cold seemed to _grasp me in the region of the heart_,
and I fell insensible."]

IV
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!

A new acquaintance we must scan.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory, Vladimir's property, a
man Who thrives this moment as I write, A philosophic anchorite:
Zaretski, once a bully bold, A gambling troop when he controlled,
Chief rascal, pot-house president, Now of a family the head, Simple
and kindly and unwed, True friend, landlord benevolent, Yea!

and a man of honour, lo!

How perfect doth our epoch grow!

V
Time was the flattering voice of fame, His ruffian bravery adored, And
true, his pistol's faultless aim An ace at fifteen paces bored.
But I must add to what I write That, tipsy once in actual fight, He
from his Kalmuck horse did leap In mud and mire to wallow deep, Drunk
as a fly; and thus the French A valuable hostage gained, A modern
Regulus unchained, Who to surrender did not blench That every morn
at Verrey's cost Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.

VI
Time was, his raillery was gay, He loved the simpleton to mock, To
make wise men the idiot play Openly or 'neath decent cloak.

Yet sometimes this or that deceit Encountered punishment complete, And
sometimes into snares as well Himself just like a greenhorn fell.

He could in disputation shine With pungent or obtuse retort, At
times to silence would resort, At times talk nonsense with design;
Quarrels among young friends he bred And to the field of honour
led; 
VII
Or reconciled them, it may be, And all the three to breakfast went;
Then he'd malign them secretly With jest and gossip gaily blent.

_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery (Like love, another sort of knavery!)
Diminishes as years decline.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine Beneath acacias, cherry-trees, From
storms protection having sought, Lived as a really wise man ought,
Like Horace, planted cabbages, Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
And lessons to his children read.

VIII
He was no fool, and Eugene mine, To friendship making no pretence,
Admired his judgment, which was fine, Pervaded with much common
sense.

He usually was glad to see The man and liked his company, So, when he
came next day to call, Was not surprised thereby at all.

But, after mutual compliments, Zaretski with a knowing grin, Ere
conversation could begin, The epistle from the bard presents.
Oneguine to the window went And scanned in silence its content.

IX

It was a cheery, generous Cartel, or challenge to a fight, Whereto in
language courteous Lenski his comrade did invite.

Oneguine, by first impulse moved, Turned and replied as it behoved,
Curtly announcing for the fray That he was "ready any day."

Zaretski rose, nor would explain, He cared no longer there to stay,
Had much to do at home that day, And so departed.

But Eugene, The matter by his conscience tried, Was with himself
dissatisfied.

X
In fact, the subject analysed, Within that secret court discussed,
In much his conduct stigmatized; For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
To jest as he had done last eve, A timid, shrinking love to grieve.

And ought he not to disregard The poet's madness? for 'tis hard At eighteen
not to play the fool!
Sincerely loving him, Eugene Assuredly should not have been Conventionality's
dull tool-- Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy, But man of sense and
probity.

XI

He might his motives have narrated, Not bristled up like a wild beast, He
ought to have conciliated That youthful heart--"But, now at least, The
opportunity is flown.

Besides, a duellist well-known Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Malicious and a slanderer.

Undoubtedly, disdain alone Should recompense his idle jeers, But fools--their
calumnies and sneers"-- Behold!

the world's opinion!(63) Our idol, Honour's motive force, Round which
revolves the universe.

[Note 63: A line of Griboyedoff's. (Woe from Wit.)]
XII

Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath, The bard his answer waits at
home, But lo!

his braggart neighbour hath Triumphant with the answer come.

Now for the jealous youth what joy!
He feared the criminal might try To treat the matter as a jest, Use
subterfuge, and thus his breast From the dread pistol turn away.

But now all doubt was set aside, Unto the windmill he must ride
To-morrow before break of day, To cock the pistol; barrel bend On
thigh or temple, friend on friend.

XIII
Resolved the flirt to cast away, The foaming Lenski would refuse,
To see his Olga ere the fray-- His watch, the sun in turn he views--
Finally tost his arms in air And lo!

he is already there!
He deemed his coming would inspire Olga with trepidation dire.

He was deceived.

Just as before The miserable bard to meet, As hope uncertain and
as sweet, Olga ran skipping from the door.

She was as heedless and as gay-- Well!

just as she was yesterday.

XIV

"Why did you leave last night so soon?" Was the first question Olga made,
Lenski, into confusion thrown, All silently hung down his head.

Jealousy and vexation took To flight before her radiant look,
Before such fond simplicity And mental elasticity.
He eyed her with a fond concern, Perceived that he was still beloved,
Already by repentance moved To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn; But
trembles, words he cannot find, Delighted, almost sane in mind.

XV
But once more pensive and distressed Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Nor enough strength of mind possessed To mention the foregoing eve,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
With ardent sighs and flattery The vile seducer shall not dare The
freshness of her heart impair, Nor shall the caterpillar come The
lily's stem to eat away, Nor shall the bud of yesterday Perish when
half disclosed its bloom!"

-- All this, my friends, translate aright:

"I with my friend intend to fight!"

XVI
If he had only known the wound Which rankled in Tattiana's breast, And
if Tattiana mine had found-- If the poor maiden could have guessed
That the two friends with morning's light Above the yawning grave
would fight,-- Ah!

it may be, affection true Had reconciled the pair anew!

But of this love, e'en casually, As yet none had discovered aught;
Eugene of course related nought, Tattiana suffered secretly; Her
nurse, who could have made a guess, Was famous for thick-headedness.

XVII
Lenski that eve in thought immersed, Now gloomy seemed and cheerful
now, But he who by the Muse was nursed Is ever thus. With frowning brow
To the pianoforte he moves And various chords upon it proves, Then,
eyeing Olga, whispers low:
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?"-- But it grew late; he must not stay;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew; To the young girl he said adieu, As
it were, tore himself away.
Gazing into his face, she said:
"What ails thee?"--"Nothing."--He is fled.

XVIII
At home arriving he addressed His care unto his pistols' plight,
Replaced them in their box, undressed And Schiller read by
candlelight.

But one thought only filled his mind, His mournful heart no peace could
find, Olga he sees before his eyes Miraculously fair arise, Vladimir
closes up his book, And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit With lovers'
rubbish filled, was neat And flowed harmoniously. He took And spouted
it with lyric fire-- Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.

XIX

Destiny hath preserved his lay.

I have it. Lo! the very thing!
"Oh!

whither have ye winged your way, Ye golden days of my young spring?

What will the coming dawn reveal?

In vain my anxious eyes appeal; In mist profound all yet is hid.
So be it!

Just the laws which bid The fatal bullet penetrate, Or innocently
past me fly.
Good governs all!

The hour draws nigh Of life or death predestinate.

Blest be the labours of the light, And blest the shadows of the
night.

XX
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray, Bright day will then begin to burn,
But the dark sepulchre I may Have entered never to return.
The memory of the bard, a dream, Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream; Men
will forget me, but my urn To visit, lovely maid, return, O'er my
remains to drop a tear, And think: here lies who loved me well, For
consecrate to me he fell In the dawn of existence drear.
Maid whom my heart desires alone, Approach, approach; I am thine own."

XXI
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,(64) He wrote ('tis the romantic
style, Though of romance therein I fail To see aught--never mind
meanwhile) And about dawn upon his breast His weary head declined
at rest, For o'er a word to fashion known, "Ideal," he had drowsy
grown.

But scarce had sleep's soft witchery Subdued him, when his neighbour
stept Into the chamber where he slept And wakened him with the
loud cry:
"'Tis time to get up!

Seven doth strike.
Oneguine waits on us, 'tis like."

[Note 64: The fact of the above words being italicised suggests the idea
that the poet is here firing a Parthian shot at some unfriendly
critic.]

XXII

He was in error; for Eugene Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
The pall of night was growing thin, To Lucifer the cock must breathe
His song, when still he slumbered deep, The sun had mounted high
his steep, A passing snowstorm wreathed away With pallid light, but
Eugene lay Upon his couch insensibly; Slumber still o'er him lingering
flies.

But finally he oped his eyes And turned aside the drapery; He gazed
upon the clock which showed He long should have been on the road.

XXIII
He rings in haste; in haste arrives His Frenchman, good Monsieur
Guillot, Who dressing-gown and slippers gives And linen on him doth
bestow.

Dressing as quickly as he can, Eugene directs the trusty man To
accompany him and to escort A box of terrible import.

Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Descends, the order Guillot gives, The fatal tubes Lepage contrived(65)
To bring behind: the triple steeds To two young oaks the coachman
leads.

[Note 65: Lepage--a celebrated gunmaker of former days.]
XXIV
Lenski the foeman's apparition Leaning against the dam expects, Zaretski,
village mechanician, In the meantime the mill inspects.
Oneguine his excuses says; "But," cried Zaretski in amaze, "Your
second you have left behind!"

A duellist of classic mind, Method was dear unto his heart He would not
that a man ye slay In a lax or informal way, But followed the strict rules
of art, And ancient usages observed (For which our praise he hath
deserved).

XXV

"My second!"

cried in turn Eugene, "Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot; To this
arrangement can be seen, No obstacle of which I know.

Although unknown to fame mayhap, He's a straightforward little chap."
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath, But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
"Shall we commence?"

--"Let it be so," Lenski replied, and soon they be Behind the mill.
Meantime ye see Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot In consultation stand aside--
The foes with downcast eyes abide.

XXVI

Foes!

Is it long since friendship rent Asunder was and hate prepared?

Since leisure was together spent, Meals, secrets, occupations shared?

Now, like hereditary foes, Malignant fury they disclose, As in some
frenzied dream of fear These friends cold-bloodedly draw near Mutual
destruction to contrive.

Cannot they amicably smile Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Depart in peace and friendly live?

But fashionable hatred's flame Trembles at artificial shame.

XXVII

The shining pistols are uncased, The mallet loud the ramrod
strikes, Bullets are down the barrels pressed, For the first time the
hammer clicks.

Lo!

poured in a thin gray cascade, The powder in the pan is laid, The
sharp flint, screwed securely on, Is cocked once more.

Uneasy grown, Guillot behind a pollard stood; Aside the foes their
mantles threw, Zaretski paces thirty-two Measured with great
exactitude.
At each extreme one takes his stand, A loaded pistol in his hand.

XXVIII
"Advance!"

-- Indifferent and sedate, The foes, as yet not taking aim, With measured
step and even gait Athwart the snow four paces came-- Four deadly
paces do they span; Oneguine slowly then began To raise his pistol
to his eye, Though he advanced unceasingly.

And lo!

five paces more they pass, And Lenski, closing his left eye, Took
aim--but as immediately Oneguine fired--Alas! alas!
The poet's hour hath sounded--See!
He drops his pistol silently.

XXIX
He on his bosom gently placed His hand, and fell. His clouded eye Not
agony, but death expressed.
So from the mountain lazily The avalanche of snow first bends, Then
glittering in the sun descends.

The cold sweat bursting from his brow, To the youth Eugene hurried now--
Gazed on him, called him.

Useless care!
He was no more! The youthful bard For evermore had disappeared.
The storm was hushed.

The blossom fair Was withered ere the morning light-- The altar
flame was quenched in night.

XXX
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view The peace which on his forehead
beamed, His breast was riddled through and through, The blood gushed
from the wound and steamed Ere this but one brief moment beat That
heart with inspiration sweet And enmity and hope and love-- The
blood boiled and the passions strove.

Now, as in a deserted house, All dark and silent hath become;
The inmate is for ever dumb, The windows whitened, shutters close--
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.

XXXI

'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate With epigrams impertinent, Sweet to
behold him obstinate, His butting horns in anger bent, The glass unwittingly
inspect And blush to own himself reflect.

Sweeter it is, my friends, if he Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
But sweeter still it is to arrange For him an honourable grave, At his
pale brow a shot to have, Placed at the customary range; But home
his body to despatch Can scarce in sweetness be a match.

XXXII
Well, if your pistol ball by chance The comrade of your youth should
strike, Who by a haughty word or glance Or any trifle else ye like You
o'er your wine insulted hath-- Or even overcome by wrath Scornfully
challenged you afield-- Tell me, of sentiments concealed Which in
your spirit dominates, When motionless your gaze beneath He lies,
upon his forehead death, And slowly life coagulates-- When deaf and
silent he doth lie Heedless of your despairing cry?

XXXIII
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand And with remorseful anguish filled,
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand-- Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's
killed!"

-- Killed!

at this dreadful exclamation Oneguine went with trepidation And the
attendants called in haste.

Most carefully Zaretski placed Within his sledge the stiffened
corse, And hurried home his awful freight.

Conscious of death approximate, Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er, And homeward like an arrow
tore.

XXXIV

My friends, the poet ye regret!

When hope's delightful flower but bloomed In bud of promise incomplete,
The manly toga scarce assumed, He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And where the admirable streams Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Tender and elevated, free?

And where tempestuous love's desires, The thirst of knowledge and of
fame, Horror of sinfulness and shame, Imagination's sacred fires, Ye
shadows of a life more high, Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?

XXXV
Perchance to benefit mankind, Or but for fame he saw the light; His
lyre, to silence now consigned, Resounding through all ages might
Have echoed to eternity.

With worldly honours, it may be, Fortune the poet had repaid.
It may be that his martyred shade Carried a truth divine away; That,
for the century designed, Had perished a creative mind, And past the
threshold of decay, He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy, The blessings
of humanity.

XXXVI
Or, it may be, the bard had passed A life in common with the rest;
Vanished his youthful years at last, The fire extinguished in his
breast, In many things had changed his life-- The Muse abandoned,
ta'en a wife, Inhabited the country, clad In dressing-gown, a cuckold
glad:
A life of fact, not fiction, led-- At forty suffered from the gout,
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
And finally, upon his bed Had finished life amid his sons, Doctors
and women, sobs and groans.

XXXVII
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast, Alas! the youthful lover slain, Poetical
enthusiast, A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
There is a spot the village near Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots, A rivulet beneath them
shoots Its waters to the neighbouring vale.

There the tired ploughman loves to lie, The reaping girls approach
and ply Within its wave the sounding pail, And by that shady rivulet
A simple tombstone hath been set.

XXXVIII

There, when the rains of spring we mark Upon the meadows showering,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,(66) Of Volga fishermen doth
sing, And the young damsel from the town, For summer to the country
flown, Whene'er across the plain at speed Alone she gallops on her
steed, Stops at the tomb in passing by; The tightened leathern rein
she draws, Aside she casts her veil of gauze And reads with rapid
eager eye The simple epitaph--a tear Doth in her gentle eye appear.

[Note 66: In Russia and other northern countries rude shoes are made
of the inner bark of the lime tree.]

XXXIX

And meditative from the spot She leisurely away doth ride, Spite of herself
with Lenski's lot Longtime her mind is occupied.
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?

Longtime was her heart desolate Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
And where may be her sister now?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men, Of fashionable dames the foe, The
misanthrope of gloomy brow, By whom the youthful bard was slain?"

-- In time I'll give ye without fail A true account and in detail.

XL

But not at present, though sincerely I on my chosen hero dote; Though
I'll return to him right early, Just at this moment I cannot.

Years have inclined me to stern prose, Years to light rhyme themselves
oppose, And now, I mournfully confess, In rhyming I show laziness.

As once, to fill the rapid page My pen no longer finds delight, Other
and colder thoughts affright, Sterner solicitudes engage, In worldly
din or solitude Upon my visions such intrude.

XLI
Fresh aspirations I have known, I am acquainted with fresh care,
Hopeless are all the first, I own, Yet still remains the old
despair.
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?

And is it true her garland bright At last is shrunk and withered
quite?

And is it true and not a jest, Not even a poetic phrase, That vanished
are my youthful days (This joking I used to protest), Never for me to
reappear-- That soon I reach my thirtieth year?

XLII
And so my noon hath come! If so, I must resign myself, in sooth;
Yet let us part in friendship, O My frivolous and jolly youth.

I thank thee for thy joyfulness, Love's tender transports and distress,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds, And all that from thy hand proceeds--
I thank thee. In thy company, With tumult or contentment still Of thy
delights I drank my fill, Enough!

with tranquil spirit I Commence a new career in life And rest from
bygone days of strife.

XLIII
But pause!
What do you think of that incident?"

"Why, I think, sir, that the revolver must have been slipped in under
the bedclothes by some one who wanted to throw all the suspicion on
Corporal Overton."

"I agree with you. Now, was that man an actual enemy of Corporal
Overton's, or did he merely thrust the revolver into the first bed that
he could in passing?"

"My own belief, sir, that an actual enemy of Overton's did it, sir."

"Now, Corporal Terry, who are the men that have cots past Corporal
Overton's--that is, past his when traveling away from Green's cot?"

"Hinkey, Clegg, Danes, Potter, Reed, Vreeland and myself, sir."

"With which one of the men you have named has Corporal Overton had any
trouble, either recently or some time back?"

"With Hinkey, for one, sir."

"What was it over?"

Noll retold the incident of the friendly scuffle between Corporals
Overton and Hyman, and the dropping of the signal flag, through a window
and upon Private Hinkey's head.

"Had Overton had trouble with other men?"

"Nothing more, sir, than that he had once or twice rebuked Vreeland and
Danes for carelessness in squad drill."

"What kind of men are Vreeland and Danes, in your opinion, Corporal?"

"Careless and happy-go-lucky, but good-hearted fellows, sir, and likely
to be good soldiers when they've been licked into shape."

"But neither of them is inclined to be dishonest or sulky?"

"From what I have seen of Vreeland and Danes, sir, I am inclined to
answer with a very positive 'no.'"

Lieutenant Prescott looked thoughtful, remaining silent for some
moments, while Corporal Noll Terry stood looking straight ahead.

"Corporal," said the young officer finally, "Mr. Holmes has told me what
a very thorough search was made after the alarm had been given. But no
sign of the missing money was found. Have you any idea on that head? Can
you make even a plausible suggestion as to how the money was taken care
of by the thief?"

"I cannot, sir."

"Have you heard any of the men make reasonable suggestions as to what
was done with the money?"

"I think I must have heard all the men in the room talking about it at
one time or another, Lieutenant, but the men are puzzled. They cannot
account for the complete disappearance of the money."

"Are you keeping your eyes and ears open all the time, for any clue in
the matter?"

"Yes, sir!" Noll answered. "And I shan't cease doing so until the whole
mystery is cleaned up."

"Good! May I depend upon you, Corporal, to come to me, at any time, with
any information that you think will help?"

"Yes, sir; and I thank you for the invitation to do so."

"If I believed Corporal Overton the guilty man, and could find evidence
that would prove his guilt and have him bounced out of the service, then
I'd do my whole duty," went on Lieutenant Prescott. "But I simply can't
believe him guilty, and so I'm prepared to help him at any time when
there's the slightest chance."

"May I tell Corporal Overton that, sir?" asked Noll eagerly.

"Yes; but caution him not to mention to others what I have said to you.
You are also at liberty to tell Overton that Captain Cortland is wholly
convinced of his innocence, and so, I know, is Lieutenant Hampton. But
some of the men in the company, and more especially in the squad room,
are holding aloof from Corporal Overton, are they not?"

"I wouldn't exactly say that they are doing it in a mean way, sir; but
of course soldiers hate thieves, and so the merest taint of a suspicion
serves to make some of the men feel rather shy about having anything
unnecessary to do with Corporal Overton."

"Too bad!" murmured Lieutenant Prescott. Then, in his usual official
tone:

"That is all, Corporal Terry."

Noll saluted and left the inner office. Almost immediately afterward
Lieutenant Prescott sauntered out.

In the meantime, Hal, after some brisk practice at wig-wagging, was on
his way back to barracks with Sergeant Hupner.

"You're going to make a real signalman, one of these days, lad,"
remarked the sergeant, kindly. "You have the speed, and you don't lose
any of the clearness of your signaling when you go fast."

"It's great work," smiled Corporal Hal. "Just for the moment it makes me
almost sorry that I didn't enlist in the signal corps."

such delight, Speech was so tame and colourless Still and shoulders

canto to a conclusion of more than doubtful taste.

The poet evidently aims a stroke at the pedantic and narrow-minded
criticism to which original genius, emancipated from the
strait-waistcoat of conventionality, is not who was prig or swell,
At thirty who was married well, At fifty who relief obtained From
public and from private ties, Who glory, wealth and dignities Hath

XII The: The" Demon," a short poem by Pushkin which at its first
appearance created some excitement in Russian society.

A more appropriate, or at any rate explanatory title, would have
been the_Tempter_.

It is descriptive of. the first manifestation of doubt and!

cynicism in his youthful mind, allegorically. as the visits of
a"demon."

Russian society was moved to embody this imaginary demon in the person
of a certain friend of Pushkin's. This must not be and fields the calm
retreat, Where every day before his eyes A blood-bespattered shade
would rise, And aimless journeys did commence-- But still remembrance
to him clings, Though late, heat, The crash of music, candles' glare

motley moving mass and bright, Young ladies in a vasty curve, To
strike, His travels like all other things Inspired but weariness

"Men," called Captain Cortland, "this is your new sergeant. He will be
obeyed and respected accordingly."

Then Captain Cortland turned and left the room.

Corporal Hyman, who belonged in this room, came forward at once, holding
out his hand.

"Aren't you the lucky one, Sergeant!" cried Hyman. "But I'm glad you got
the step up. You've won it. Well, we're all here. Fall to and reorganize
us, Sergeant."

"There will have to be very little of that, I imagine, Corporal Hyman,"
replied the boyish young sergeant, smiling. "The room has been running
all right, hasn't it?"

"So-so," laughed Corporal Hyman. "But I believe that some of these buck
doughboys need a bit of jacking up."

Corporal Hyman turned, with a grinning face, toward the men. But none of
them were looking that way at the moment. Every other man in the room
appeared interested in some other subject than the new sergeant.

"Go for 'em," muttered Hyman grimly under his breath. "It's a shame for
you to have to stand for this sort of thing, kid! Pound 'em into shape.
Make 'em stand around for you."

"I will, in matters of discipline and routine, whenever necessary,"
Sergeant Hal answered, in an equally low voice. "But if the men don't
care for me personally that's another matter. I'll never persecute any
soldier just because he doesn't like me."

"It's all that cursed misunderstanding over 'Long Green,'" muttered
Corporal Hyman. "Of course you can't very well make a yell about it, but
I see several fights on my hands from right now on, until I've gotten
these buck doughboys licked into a proper appreciation of the new boss
of their squad room."

"Don't have any fights on my account, Hyman," urged Sergeant Hal.

"Well, I won't, then," came the dry retort. "I'll have a few good fights
on my own account, then, for it's a personal grievance when the men turn
down a man that I like."

The conversation was interrupted, at that moment, by the in-coming of
First Sergeant Gray.

"I'm glad over your rise, Overton," beamed the first sergeant. "And it
has come quickly. I'm here to warn you for guard duty. You'll report at
guard mount to-morrow morning as sergeant of the guard."

"That does come rather speedily, doesn't it?" laughed Hal. "Who is to be
officer of the day to-morrow?"

"Lieutenant Ferrers," responded Sergeant Gray gravely.

"What? The joke to be officer of the day?" exploded Corporal Hyman.

"Corporal," came the first sergeant's swift, serious rebuke, "whenever
you allude to your superior officers you'll do so with the utmost
respect."

"My flag's down," replied Corporal Hyman. "I surrender. But, Sergeant,
is there anything in the blue book of rules against my going away in a
corner for a quiet laugh."

"No," rejoined Sergeant Gray stiffly, and Hyman left them.

"Of course you understand, Sergeant Overton," went on Sergeant Gray,
"that a little more than the usual responsibility will devolve upon you
to-morrow. You know how new Lieutenant Ferrers is to the Army. You may
be able quietly to prevent him from doing something foolish--some little
hint that you can give him you know."

"I'll have my eyes open," Sergeant Hal promised.

Sergeant Gray warned two other men in the room to report for guard duty
in the morning, then went to Sergeant Hupner's room to warn others. Hal
turned out the squad at mess call. By this time the new young sergeant
had sewed on his new chevron, the outward sign of his promotion.

Through most of the evening Hal and Hyman sat apart by one of the
writing tables, chatting by themselves. Since the men had shown open
dislike of the new sergeant Hal did not force himself upon them.
Finally, however, the fun started by some of the men becoming altogether
too rough and noisy.

"Squad room attention!" shouted Sergeant Hal, leaping to his feet.
Corporal Hyman, too, jumped up.

All of the men came instantly to attention. Some of them looked merely
curious, but a few glared back at their new sergeant.

"Some of you men have been more noisy and rough than is warranted by a
proper sense of freedom in barracks," Hal said quietly but firmly. "Fun
may go on, but all real disorder will cease at once, and not be resumed.
That is all."

Hal turned to resume his seat at the table. But from three or four men
in the center of the room, as they turned away, came a muffled groan.

That sign of insubordination brought the young sergeant to his feet once
more in an instant. His under lip trembled slightly, but he strode in
among the men.

"Men, I've something to say to you," announced the new sergeant coolly.
"I intend to preserve discipline in this squad room, though I don't
expect to do it like a martinet. Some of you groaned, just now, when my
back was turned. Soldiers of the regular Army are men of courage. No
real man fights behind another man's back. Has any man here anything
that he wishes to say to my face?"

It was a tense moment. Three or four of the men looked as though tempted
to "say a lot."

Sergeant Hal, his hands tightly gripped, stood facing them, waiting.

Nearly a score of feet away Corporal Hyman stood negligently by. There
was nothing aggressive in his manner, but he was ready to go to the
support of his sergeant.

"Let him show me if he dares."

Into such a passion was he working himself that Hinkey seemed likely to
tear himself away from the two soldiers who sought to restrain him.

But Hal had sense enough to keep his own hands out of the affair.

"Meade, get in there and help," he directed.

Then, with Hinkey growing rapidly angrier and putting forth more
strength, there was battle royal.

When it was over Hinkey had a bleeding nose, a cut lip, one eye closed
and his uniform all but torn from him.

But he panted and surrendered, at last--a prisoner.

"What's this all about, Sergeant Overton?" demanded First Sergeant Gray,
hastening to the spot.

"I've placed Hinkey under arrest, Sergeant, for disrespectful speech
against an officer, for disrespectful answers to myself and for
insubordination."

"You wouldn't act without strong cause, I know, Sergeant Overton,"
replied First Sergeant Gray. "Hustle Private Hinkey down to the guard
house, then."

"Forward with him, men," ordered Hal.

Hinkey would have started the fight all over again, but he realized the
weight of discipline and numbers, and felt that it would give his enemy
too much satisfaction.

So, with much growling and many oaths, Hinkey submitted to being marched
down to the guard house.

To the sergeant of the guard Hal explained the charge. The sergeant of
the guard promptly sent for Lieutenant Hayes, of C Company, who was
officer of the day.

Mr. Hayes listened attentively to the charge preferred by Sergeant
Overton. Hinkey, too, who was behind a barred door in one of the cells,
listened with darkening brow.

"It's all rot!" raged the arrested soldier. "It's all a personal matter,
and Overton has vented his spite on me."

"Silence, my man!" ordered Lieutenant Hayes sternly. "And when you refer
to Sergeant Overton, call him by his title."

"I won't shut up until I've had my say!" raged Private Hinkey, gripping
with both hands the bars of the cell door. "Lieutenant----"

"Silence, or you'll have disrespectful language to the officer of the
day added to the other charges against you," warned Lieutenant Hayes,
stepping over to the cell door. "Not another word out of you, Hinkey."

In the old days the prisoner would have been locked up until the next
general court-martial convened. Or, when anew all Nature teems, Do we

spread--"_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath, Who early died a gallant
death_," Thereon the passing traveller read:"_The date, his fleeting
years how long-- Repose in peace, thou child of song_."

VII Time was, the breath of early dawn Would agitate a mystic wreath Hung
on a pine branch earthward drawn Above the humble urn of death. Time
was, two maidens from their home At eventide would hither come, And, by
the light the moonbeams gave, Lament, embrace upon that grave. But
now--none heeds the monument Of woe: effaced the pathway now: There
is no wreath upon the bough: Alone beside it, gray and bent, As
formerly the shepherd sits And his poor basten sandal knits.

VII I My poor Vladimir, bitter activity Thee but a little space bewept,
he Faithless, alas!

thy maid appears, Nor true unto her sorrow kept. Another could her heart
engage, Another could her woe assuage By flattery and lover's art-- A
lancer captivates her heart!

A lancer her soul dotes upon: Before the altar, lo! the pair, Mark ye
with what a modest air She bows her head beneath the crown;(68) Behold
her downcast eyes which glow, Her lips where light smiles come and go![
Note 68: The crown used in celebrating marriages in Russia according
to the forms of the Eastern Church.

See Note 28.] IX My poor Vladimir! In the tomb, Passed into dull
eternity, Was the sad poet filled with gloom beyond Lethe home;
The lancer, to his calling bound, Back to his regiment must roam.

The aged mother, bathed in tears, Distracted by her grief appears When
the hour came to bid good-bye-- But my Tattiana's eyes were dry. Only her
countenance assumed A deadly pallor, distressed long her eyes a sister's
heart was set Afar is borne by cruel fate, For evermore is separate.

She wanders aimless as a sprite, Into the tangled garden goes But
nowhere can she find repose, Nor even tears afford respite, Of
consolation all bereft-- Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft. XII
In cruel solitude each day With flame more ardent passion burns,
And to Oneguine far away Her heart importunately turns.

She never more his face may view, For was it not her duty to Detest him
for a brother slain? The poet fell; already men No more remembered him;
unto Another his betrothed was given; The memory of the bard was
driven Like smoke athwart the heaven blue; Two hearts perchance
were desolate And mourned him still.

Already dance to song proceeds; The fisher's fire afar illumes The river's
bank.

Tattiana lone Beneath the silver of the moon Long time Private in
deep path across the plain doth keep-- Proceeds, until she from a
hill Sees where a noble mansion stood, A village and resigned, A
visionary personage With his exasperated sense, His energy and
impotence.

XX I And numerous pages had preserved The sharp incisions of his nail,
And these the attentive maid observed With eye precise and without
fail.

Tattiana saw with trepidation By what idea or observation Oneguine
was the most impressed, In what beneath, a wood, A garden go, the
market for a maid, With many a vacancy,'tis said."--" Alas!

my friend, no revenue!""

Enough to see tried one winter's end; If not, the money I will lend

constant use amongst Russian females.] XXV The venerable dame
opined The counsel good and full of reason, by a shining rill. She gazed
thereon, and instant beat Her heart more loudly and more fleet.

XIV She hesitates, in doubt is thrown--" Shall I proceed, or homeward
flee?

He is not there I would see." Tattiana from the hill descends With bated
breath, around she bends A countenance perplexed and scared.

She enters a deserted yard-- Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out, But at
her shriek ran forth noise The household troop of little boys, with
a scuffle and and a shout The curs away to kennel chase, The damsel
under escort place.

XV" Can I inspect the mansion, please?" Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Unto Anicia for the keys The family of children hie. Anicia soon
appears, the door Opens unto her visitor.

Into the lonely house she went, Wherein a space Oneguine spent. She gazed--a
cue, forgotten long, Doth on the billiard table rest, Upon the
tumbled sofa placed, A riding whip. She strolls along.

The beldam saith:" The hearth, by it The master always used to sit. XV
I" Departed Lenski here to dine In winter time would often come. Please
follow this way, lady mine, This is my master's sitting-room.'

Tis here he slept, his coffee took, Into accounts would sometimes look,
A book at early morn perused. The room my former master used. On Sundays
by yon window he, Spectacles upon nose, all day Was wont with me at
cards to play.

God save his soul eternally And grant his weary bones their rest Deep in
our mother Earth's chill breast!" XVII Tattiana's eyes with tender
gleam On everything around her gaze, Of priceless value all things
seem And in her languid bosom raise A pleasure though with sorrow
knit: The table open with its lamp unlit, The pile of books, with
carpet spread Beneath the window-sill his bed, The landscape which
the moonbeams fret, The twilight pale which softens all, Lord Byron's
portrait on the wall And cast-iron statuette With folded arms and
eyes bent low, Cocked hat and melancholy brow.(69)[ Note 69: The
Russians not unfrequently adorn their apartments with effigies of
the great Napoleon.]

XVII I Long in this fashionable cell Tattiana as enchanted stood; But
it grew late; cold blew the gale; Dark was the valley and the slept
o'er the river misty the grown.

Behind the mountain sank the moon. Long, long the hour had past when
home Our youthful wanderer should roam.

in future to proceed That certain volumes she might read. XIX Adieu

.
At the head was the cavalry band, followed by a squadron (two troops or
companies) of splendidly mounted fighting men, their accoutrements
jingling.

As the cavalry, its band blaring joyously, passed out before the people,
the Signal Corps men followed on foot. Now the artillery, preceded by a
mounted band that was just now silent, swung into line. Right behind the
artillery, with its men perched up on the seats, their arms folded, or
else driving the horses from saddles, came more men on foot, the
ordnance detachment.

Now a third band, the Thirty-fourth's, marched on to the scene, silent,
like the artillery musicians. After the third band in the line came the
first battalion of the Thirty-fourth--at its head Colonel North and
Major Silsbee, with their respective staffs, all on horseback. And now
behind them marched, with the precise, easy rhythm of the foot soldier,
the four companies, A, B, C and D, all moving like so many fine,
automatic, easy-jointed machines.

The mounted detachments had brought forth rounds of rousing applause as
they swept by, but when the infantrymen--the real, solid, fighting wall
of the Army came in view, its men moving with the perfectly gaited,
steady whump, whump! of superbly marching men, the spectators began to
yell in frantic earnest.

The cavalry band ceased its stirring strain. Instantly the mounted drum
major of the artillery swung about on his horse, holding up his baton,
then bringing it down with the signal, "play."

As the artillery band blazed forth in a glory of rousing melody the
noise of people's feet increased.

By the time that the infantry marched past the central portion of the
great mass of civilians it was the turn of the Thirty-fourth's band.
Every spectator, nearly, was now standing, stamping, waving. Cheer after
cheer went up.

It seemed as though human enthusiasm could not know greater bounds.
Faint echoes must have reached the distant, nearly empty circus big-top.
Yet the breathless thousands had caught, as yet, but the first tame
pageantry of this glimpse of the glory of armed men.

Just before B company, as it swung along at the good old regular gait,
one excited onlooker hurled a well-filled wallet--the only sign left him
for showing his utter enthusiasm.

File after file of foot soldiers stepped over this wallet, yet, if one
of the infantrymen knew it was there, not one of them let any sign
escape him. Discipline was absolutely perfect. These marching men of
rifle and bayonet swept on, heads up, eyes straight forward, every file
in flawless, absolute alignment.

And so the wallet was passed over and left behind while the crowd,
staring at this unexpected scene of soldierly discipline, went wilder
than before, in a frantic acclaim that was granted from the soul.

A policeman, standing at the edge of the crowd, picked up the wallet,
returning it to its somewhat disappointed owner.

When the parade had swept around the field, each band playing in its
turn, the crowd settled back with a sigh, as though satisfied that the
greatest sight on the programme had been witnessed.

Yet hardly was there a pause. A troop of cavalry came forward, now, at
the trot. All the evolutions of the school of the troop, mounted, were
now gone through with. All the swift, bewildering changes of the
cavalryman's manual of arms were exhibited.

Single riders and squads exhibited some of the prettiest work of the
cowboy, for the American cavalryman has learned his riding and his
daring from the best work of generations of cowboys.

Men rode two, and then three horses, at once, standing on bareback and
leaping their animals over gates, ditches and hedges.

Down at the far end of the wheel a squad of cavalrymen halted,
dismounted, unlimbered their carbines, and began firing at a squad of
cavalrymen who galloped toward them from the other extremity of the
field. Three of the men fired upon toppled and fell from their saddles
to the dust with wonderful realism, while startled "ohs!" came from the
eager onlookers.

Just behind this detachment rode more cavalrymen at the gallop. Three of
these men, without seeming effort, swung down from their saddles, while
their mounts still galloped, picked up the "dead or wounded," and then
these horses, guided by their riders, wheeled and made fast time with
the mock "casualties" to the rear.

It was a wonderful sight. Now, the audience began to come somewhere near
its actual limits of enthusiasm.

Other yet more wonderful feats of skill and precision by the cavalry
followed. Ere the "yellow-legs" had retired, momentarily, from the field
of display, every small boy in the crowd--and many a large one--had
decided that the life of the trooper must be his.

Then the flying artillery came on to the field, amid clouds of dust, the
urgings of drivers, the sharp commands of officers and the pealing
commands of bugles. For the first time in their lives the spectators
realized how like lightning the American artillery moves, and how
speedily it gets into deadly action. It was a pity that none of the fine
marksmanship with the field cannon could be shown. The audience had to
be satisfied with salvo after salvo fired with blank cartridges at
imaginary enemies.

Then next the scene swiftly changed to a well-simulated one of battle,
in which all arms engaged. "Under heavy fire" the engineers threw a
bridge swiftly across a wide ditch representing a stream. While this was
going on Signal Corps men laid wires and had telephone and telegraph
instruments in operation from the firing line to the rear.

More of it came when the squadron of cavalry, at one end of the field,
and backed by the signal and ordnance detachments, now bearing rifles,
impersonated a hostile advance, firing volleys and "at will" at the
artillery and infantry, posted to repulse them.

It took the breath of the spectators away. For now they gazed upon the
grim realities of war, save for the actual deaths and manglings which
all knew must follow such fierce firing when done in reality.

It was some minutes afterward before the smoke cleared away from over
the field sufficiently to allow all to see the next spectacles. But all
onlookers now felt the need of a brief rest from such sensations.

There were a host of features to the rousing programme, and not a
spectator but thrilled and throbbed, and thanked his lucky stars that he
was here, at the show, the spectacle of a lifetime!

Feature after feature followed, in a swiftly-moving, tightly-packed
programme lasting three hours. The riot drill, showing with vivid
effect how a battalion of regular infantry can move through a densely
packed mob, brought forth tumultuous cheers. When the cheering had
subsided such shouts as these were offered by excited spectators:

"Bring your anarchists here to-night, and show them this!"

"Never get into a riot unless you go with the regulars!"

It was truly an Army afternoon. All such afternoons are, for the average
American knows truly nothing about his own Army. When he sees it
actually at work he becomes, for the time at least, an "Army crank."

There were many features in which only one, or a few men, figured
importantly. Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The drive becomes monotonous-- Well!

Larina appears to us An ancient lady full of grace.-- That bilberry wine,
I'm sore afraid, The deuce with my inside has played."

IV
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?" "She who with melancholy face
And silent as the maid Svetlana(30) Hard by the window took her place."--
"The younger, you're in love with her!" "Well!"--"I the elder should
prefer, Were I like you a bard by trade-- In Olga's face no
life's displayed.

'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk, An oval countenance and pink, Yon silly moon
upon the brink Of the horizon she is like!"-- Vladimir something curtly
said Nor further comment that night made.

[Note 30: "Svetlana," a short poem by Joukovski, upon which his fame
mainly rests. Joukovski was an unblushing plagiarist. Many eminent
English poets have been laid under contribution by him, often without
going through the form of acknowledging the source of inspiration.

Even the poem in question cannot be pronounced entirely original, though
its intrinsic beauty is unquestionable. It undoubtedly owes its
origin to Burger's poem "Leonora," which has found so many English
translators.

Not content with a single development of Burger's ghastly production the
Russian poet has directly paraphrased "Leonora" under its own title,
and also written a poem "Liudmila" in imitation of it.
The principal outlines of these three poems are as follows: A maiden
loses her lover in the wars; she murmurs at Providence and is vainly
reproved for such blasphemy by her mother.

Providence at length loses patience and sends her lover's spirit, to
all appearances as if in the flesh, who induces the unfortunate maiden
to elope. Instead of riding to a church or bridal chamber the unpleasant
bridegroom resorts to the graveyard and repairs to his own grave, from
which he has recently issued to execute his errand. It is a repulsive
subject. "Svetlana," however, is more agreeable than its prototype
"Leonora," inasmuch as the whole catastrophe turns out a dream brought
on by "sorcery," during the "sviatki" or Holy Nights (see Canto
V. st. x), and the dreamer awakes to hear the tinkling of her lover's
sledge approaching.

"Svetlana" has been translated by Sir John Bowring.]
V
Meantime Oneguine's apparition At Larina's abode produced Quite a
sensation; the position To all good neighbours' sport conduced.

Endless conjectures all propound And secretly their views expound.
What jokes and guesses now abound, A beau is for Tattiana found!
In fact, some people were assured The wedding-day had been arranged,
But the date subsequently changed Till proper rings could be
procured.

On Lenski's matrimonial fate They long ago had held debate.

VI
Of course Tattiana was annoyed By such allusions scandalous, Yet was
her inmost soul o'erjoyed With satisfaction marvellous, As in her
heart the thought sank home, I am in love, my hour hath come!

Thus in the earth the seed expands Obedient to warm Spring's
commands.

Long time her young imagination By indolence and languor fired The fated
nutriment desired; And long internal agitation Had filled her
youthful breast with gloom, She waited for--I don't know whom!

VII
The fatal hour had come at last-- She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis
he!

Alas! for now before her passed The same warm vision constantly; Now
all things round about repeat Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet His name:
the tenderness of home Tiresome unto her hath become And the
kind-hearted servitors:
Immersed in melancholy thought, She hears of conversation nought
And hated casual visitors, Their coming which no man expects, And
stay whose length none recollects.

VIII
Now with what eager interest She the delicious novel reads, With
what avidity and zest She drinks in those seductive deeds!

All the creations which below From happy inspiration flow, The swain of
Julia Wolmar, Malek Adel and De Linar,(31) Werther, rebellious
martyr bold, And that unrivalled paragon, The sleep-compelling
Grandison, Our tender dreamer had enrolled A single being: 'twas
in fine No other than Oneguine mine.

[Note 31: The heroes of two romances much in vogue in Pushkin's time:
the former by Madame Cottin, the latter by the famous Madame Krudener.
The frequent mention in the course of this poem of romances once
enjoying a European celebrity but now consigned to oblivion, will
impress the reader with the transitory nature of merely mediocre
literary reputation.

One has now to search for the very names of most of the popular authors
of Pushkin's day and rummage biographical dictionaries for the
dates of their births and deaths.

Yet the poet's prime was but fifty years ago, and had he lived to a ripe
old age he would have been amongst us still. He was four years younger
than the late Mr.

Thomas Carlyle. The decadence of Richardson's popularity amongst his
countrymen is a fact familiar to all.]

IX
Dreaming herself the heroine Of the romances she preferred, Clarissa,
Julia, Delphine,--(32) Tattiana through the forest erred, And the
bad book accompanies.

Upon those pages she descries Her passion's faithful counterpart, Fruit
of the yearnings of the heart.

She heaves a sigh and deep intent On raptures, sorrows not her own,
She murmurs in an undertone A letter for her hero meant:
That hero, though his merit shone, Was certainly no Grandison.

[Note 32: Referring to Richardson's "Clarissa Harlowe," "La Nouvelle
Heloise," and Madame de Stael's "Delphine."]

X
Alas!

my friends, the years flit by And after them at headlong pace The
evanescent fashions fly In motley and amusing chase.

The world is ever altering!

Farthingales, patches, were the thing, And courtier, fop, and usurer
Would once in powdered wig appear; Time was, the poet's tender quill
In hopes of everlasting fame A finished madrigal would frame Or
couplets more ingenious still; Time was, a valiant general might
Serve who could neither read nor write.

XI
Time was, in style magniloquent Authors replete with sacred fire
Their heroes used to represent All that perfection could desire;
Ever by adverse fate oppressed, Their idols they were wont to invest
With intellect, a taste refined, And handsome countenance combined,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt; The excited hero in a trice Was
ready for self-sacrifice, And in the final tome we learnt, Vice had
due punishment awarded, Virtue was with a bride rewarded.

XII
But now our minds are mystified And Virtue acts as a narcotic, Vice
in romance is glorified And triumphs in career erotic.

The monsters of the British Muse Deprive our schoolgirls of repose, The
idols of their adoration A Vampire fond of meditation, Or Melmoth,
gloomy wanderer he, The Eternal Jew or the Corsair Or the mysterious
Sbogar.(33) Byron's capricious phantasy Could in romantic mantle
drape E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.

[Note 33: "Melmoth," a romance by Maturin, and "Jean Sbogar," by Ch.

Nodier. "The Vampire," a tale published in 1819, was erroneously
attributed to Lord Byron.

XIII

My friends, what means this odd digression?
May be that I by heaven's decrees Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
And shall adopt some new caprice.

Thus having braved Apollo's rage With humble prose I'll fill my page
And a romance in ancient style Shall my declining years beguile; Nor shall
my pen paint terribly The torment born of crime unseen, But shall
depict the touching scene Of Russian domesticity; I will descant
on love's sweet dream, The olden time shall be my theme.

XIV

Old people's simple conversations My unpretending page shall fill,
Their offspring's innocent flirtations By the old lime-tree or the
rill, Their Jealousy and separation And tears of reconciliation:
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find, But finally in wedlock bind.

The passionate speeches I'll repeat, Accents of rapture or despair
I uttered to my lady fair Long ago, prostrate at her feet.

Then they came easily enow, My tongue is somewhat rusty now.

XV

Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
What bitter tears with thee I shed!

Thou hast resigned thy destiny Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.

Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before, Hope with her fascinating power
To dire contentment shall give birth And thou shalt taste the joys
of earth.

Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream, Fantastic images shall
swarm In thy imagination warm, Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err, Confront thy fated torturer!

XVI
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.

She seeks the garden in her need-- Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
And cares not farther to proceed; Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse, Barely to draw her breath
she seems, Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.

And now 'tis night, the guardian moon Sails her allotted course on high,
And from the misty woodland nigh The nightingale trills forth her
tune; Restless Tattiana sleepless lay And thus unto her nurse did
say:

XVII 
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.

Open the window--sit by me." "What ails thee, dear?"--"I feel depressed.

Relate some ancient history."

"But which, my dear?--In days of yore Within my memory I bore Many an
ancient legend which In monsters and fair dames was rich; But now
my mind is desolate, What once I knew is clean forgot-- Alas!

how wretched now my lot!" "But tell me, nurse, can you relate The days
which to your youth belong?

Were you in love when you were young?"--
XVIII

"Alack! Tattiana," she replied, "We never loved in days of old, My
mother-in-law who lately died(34) Had killed me had the like been
told."

"How came you then to wed a man?"-- "Why, as God ordered! My Ivan Was
younger than myself, my light, For I myself was thirteen quite;(35)
The matchmaker a fortnight sped, Her suit before my parents
pressing:
At last my father gave his blessing, And bitter tears of fright I
shed.

Weeping they loosed my tresses long(36) And led me off to church
with song."

[Note 34: A young married couple amongst Russian peasants reside in the
house of the bridegroom's father till the "tiaglo," or family circle
is broken up by his death.]
[Note 35: Marriages amongst Russian serfs used formerly to take
place at ridiculously early ages.

Haxthausen asserts that strong hearty peasant women were to be seen
at work in the fields with their infant husbands in their arms.

The inducement lay in the fact that the "tiaglo" (see previous note)
received an additional lot of the communal land for every male added
to its number, though this could have formed an inducement in the
southern and fertile provinces of Russia only, as it is believed
that agriculture in the north is so unremunerative that land has
often to be forced upon the peasants, in order that the taxes, for
which the whole Commune is responsible to Government, may be paid.

The abuse of early marriages was regulated by Tsar Nicholas.]
[Note 36: Courtships were not unfrequently carried on in the larger
villages, which alone could support such an individual, by means
of a "svakha," or matchmaker.

In Russia unmarried girls wear their hair in a single long plait
or tail, "kossa;" the married women, on the other hand, in two,
which are twisted into the head-gear.]

XIX
"Then amongst strangers I was left-- But I perceive thou dost not
heed--" "Alas!

dear nurse, my heart is cleft, Mortally sick I am indeed.
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain--" "My darling child, thou art in
pain.-- The Lord deliver her and save!

Tell me at once what wilt thou have?

I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.-- How thy hands burn!"--"Dear nurse,
I'm well.
I am--in love--you know--don't tell!" "The Lord be with thee, O my
daughter!"

-- And the old nurse a brief prayer said And crossed with trembling
hand the maid.

XX
"I am in love," her whispers tell The aged woman in her woe:

"My heart's delight, thou art not well."-- "I am in love, nurse!
leave me now." Behold!

the moon was shining bright And showed with an uncertain light Tattiana's
beauty, pale with care, Her tears and her dishevelled hair; And
on the footstool sitting down Beside our youthful heroine fair, A
kerchief round her silver hair The aged nurse in ample gown,(37)
Whilst all creation seemed to dream Enchanted by the moon's pale
beam.

[Note 37: It is thus that I am compelled to render a female garment
not known, so far as I am aware, to Western Europe.
It is called by the natives "doushegreika," that is to say, "warmer
of the soul"--in French, chaufferette de l'ame. It is a species of thick
pelisse worn over the "sarafan," or gown.]

XXI
But borne in spirit far away Tattiana gazes on the moon, And starting
suddenly doth say:
"Nurse, leave me.

I would be alone.
Pen, paper bring: the table too Draw near.

I soon to sleep shall go-- Good-night." Behold! she is alone!
'Tis silent--on her shines the moon-- Upon her elbow she reclines,
And Eugene ever in her soul Indites an inconsiderate scroll Wherein
love innocently pines.

Now it is ready to be sent-- For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?

XXII

I have known beauties cold and raw As Winter in their purity, Striking
the intellect with awe By dull insensibility, And I admired their
common sense And natural benevolence, But, I acknowledge, from them
fled; For on their brows I trembling read The inscription o'er the
gates of Hell "Abandon hope for ever here!"

(38) Love to inspire doth woe appear To such--delightful to repel.

Perchance upon the Neva e'en Similar dames ye may have seen.

[Note 38: A Russian annotator complains that the poet has mutilated
Dante's famous line.]

XXIII
Amid submissive herds of men Virgins miraculous I see, Who selfishly
unmoved remain Alike by sighs and flattery.

But what astonished do I find When harsh demeanour hath consigned
A timid love to banishment?

-- On fresh allurements they are bent, At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words Appear attuned to softer chords;
And then with blind credulity The youthful lover once again Pursues
phantasmagoria vain.

XXIV

Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?

-- Because in singleness of thought She never of deception dreamed But
trusted the ideal she wrought?-- Because her passion wanted art,
Obeyed the impulses of heart?-- Because she was so innocent, That Heaven
her character had blent With an imagination wild, With intellect
and strong volition And a determined disposition, An ardent heart
and yet so mild?

-- Doth love's incautiousness in her So irremissible appear?

XXV
O ye whom tender love hath pained Without the ken of parents both, Whose
hearts responsive have remained To the impressions of our youth,
The all-entrancing joys of love-- Young ladies, if ye ever strove
The mystic lines to tear away A lover's letter might convey, Or
into bold hands anxiously Have e'er a precious tress consigned, Or
even, silent and resigned, When separation's hour drew nigh, Have
felt love's agitated kiss With tears, confused emotions, bliss,--
XXVI
With unanimity complete, Condemn not weak Tattiana mine; Do not
cold-bloodedly repeat The sneers of critics superfine; And you, O
maids immaculate, Whom vice, if named, doth agitate E'en as the
presence of a snake, I the same admonition make.

Who knows? with love's consuming flame Perchance you also soon may
burn, Then to some gallant in your turn Will be ascribed by
treacherous Fame The triumph of a conquest new.

The God of Love is after you!

XXVII
A coquette loves by calculation, Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
A love which knew no limitation, Even as the love of children dear.

She did not think "procrastination Enhances love in estimation And thus
secures the prey we seek.

His vanity first let us pique With hope and then perplexity, Excruciate
the heart and late With jealous fire resuscitate, Lest jaded with
satiety, The artful prisoner should seek Incessantly his chains
to break."

XXVIII
I still a complication view, My country's honour and repute Demands that
I translate for you The letter which Tattiana wrote.

At Russ she was by no means clever And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And in her native language she Possessed nor ease nor fluency, So she
in French herself expressed.

I cannot help it I declare, Though hitherto a lady ne'er In Russ her love
made manifest, And never hath our language proud In correspondence been
allowed.(39)
[Note 39: It is well known that until the reign of the late Tsar
French was the language of the Russian court and of Russian fashionable
society.

It should be borne in mind that at the time this poem was written
literary warfare more or less open was being waged between two
hostile schools of Russian men of letters.

These consisted of the _Arzamass_, or French school, to which Pushkin
himself together with his uncle Vassili Pushkin the "Nestor of the
Arzamass" belonged, and their opponents who devoted themselves to
the cultivation of the vernacular.]

XXIX
They wish that ladies should, I hear, Learn Russian, but the Lord
defend!

I can't conceive a little dear With the "Well-Wisher" in her hand!

(40) I ask, all ye who poets are, Is it not true?

the objects fair, To whom ye for unnumbered crimes Had to compose
in secret rhymes, To whom your hearts were consecrate,-- Did they
not all the Russian tongue With little knowledge and that wrong In
charming fashion mutilate?

Did not their lips with foreign speech The native Russian tongue
impeach?

[Note 40: The "Blago-Namierenni," or "Well-Wisher," was an inferior
Russian newspaper of the day, much scoffed at by contemporaries.

The editor once excused himself for some gross error by pleading that
he had been "on the loose."]

XXX
God grant I meet not at a ball Or at a promenade mayhap, A schoolmaster
in yellow shawl Or a professor in tulle cap.

As rosy lips without a smile, The Russian language I deem vile Without
grammatical mistakes.

May be, and this my terror wakes, The fair of the next generation, As
every journal now entreats, Will teach grammatical conceits,
Introduce verse in conversation.

But I--what is all this to me?
Will to the old times faithful be.

XXXI

Speech careless, incorrect, but soft, With inexact pronunciation Raises
within my breast as oft As formerly much agitation.

Repentance wields not now her spell And gallicisms I love as well
As the sins of my youthful days Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.(41)
But I must now employ my Muse With the epistle of my fair; I promised!

--Did I so?--Well, there!
Now I am ready to refuse.

I know that Parny's tender pen(42) Is no more cherished amongst men.

[Note 41: Hippolyte Bogdanovitch--b. 1743, d. 1803--though possessing
considerable poetical talent was like many other Russian authors
more remarkable for successful imitation than for original genius.

His most remarkable production is "Doushenka," "The Darling," a
composition somewhat in the style of La Fontaine's "Psyche."

Its merit consists in graceful phraseology, and a strong pervading
sense of humour.]

[Note 42: Parny--a French poet of the era of the first Napoleon, b.
1753, d. 1814.

Introduced to the aged Voltaire during his last visit to Paris, the
patriarch laid his hands upon the youth's head and exclaimed: "Mon
cher Tibulle."

He is chiefly known for his erotic poetry which attracted the affectionate
regard of the youthful Pushkin when a student at the Lyceum.

We regret to add that, having accepted a pension from Napoleon, Parny
forthwith proceeded to damage his literary reputation by inditing
an "epic" poem entitled "Goddam!

Goddam! par un French--Dog."

It is descriptive of the approaching conquest of Britain by Napoleon,
and treats the embryo enterprise as if already conducted to a successful
conclusion and become matter of history.

A good account of the bard and his creations will be found in the
_Saturday Review_ of the 2d August 1879.]

Ferrers fidgeted until he
could endure the silence no longer.

"You--you wanted to speak to me, sir?" stammered Algy, the frigid
atmosphere disconcerting him.

"I never wanted to speak to a man less in my life," rejoined Colonel
North icily.

His intense And solemn longing for the watch at night, His ardent
joy in knighthood, won at last,-- She shared before she saw him,
with that sense Of subtle sympathy a mother, only, knows.

She spoke her thoughts aloud in pride-thrilled tones--
"Almost a knight, my Greane, is Christalan; How valiant, faithful,
noble he has been, And will be ever, my true-hearted son!"

"Greane!

Greane! they come! I see a dusty cloud That hides and heralds the
approach of men.

Look, is it Christalan?
"Further than Clowdry, Mr. Ferrers?"

"Oh, dear, yes, sir," admitted Algy promptly. "Took the train, in fact,
sir, and ran up to Ridgecrest. The Benson-Bodges have a new mountain
estate of their own up there. Just heard about it the other day, sir.
Wrote Benson-Bodge himself, and got a letter yesterday evening. Old
Bense invited me to come up and visit himself and family, and not to
stand on ceremony. So I didn't."

"No; you didn't stand on any ceremony, Mr. Ferrers," was the colonel's
sarcastic response. "Not even the ceremony of formality of obtaining
leave."

"But it was all right this time, sir. Quite all right, sir," went on
Algy Ferrers with more confidence. "I rather think you know who the
Benson-Bodges are, sir? Most important people. A man in the Army can't
afford to ignore them, sir--so I didn't."

"I don't know anything about the people you name, Mr. Ferrers, and I
don't want to."

"Pardon me, sir, won't you?" demanded Algy beamingly, "but for once I am
quite certain you are wrong, sir. Really an Army man can't afford not to
know the Benson-Bodges. Old Bense is a cousin of the President. Old
Bense has tremendous influence at Washington."

"Then I wonder, Mr. Ferrers, if your friend has influence enough at
Washington to save your shoulder-straps for you?"

"Eh, sir? What's that? What do you mean, sir?" asked Algy, again looking
puzzled and uneasy.

"I am going to make my meaning very clear, Mr. Ferrers. To-day's conduct
is merely the winding up affair of many discreditable pieces of conduct
in your part. You have proved, conclusively, that you are not fit to be
an officer in the Army."

"Not fit to----" repeated Algy slowly. It matters not. Hope e'en to
these With childlike lisp will lie to please.

[Note 51: Refers to the "Sviatki" or Holy Nights between Christmas Eve
and Twelfth Night. Divination, or the telling of fortunes by various
expedients, is the favourite pastime on these occasions.]
VIII
Tattiana gazed with curious eye On melted wax in water poured; The
clue unto some mystery She deemed its outline might afford.

Rings from a dish of water full In order due the maidens pull; But
when Tattiana's hand had ta'en A ring she heard the ancient
strain:
_The peasants there are rich as kings, They shovel silver with a
spade, He whom we sing to shall be made Happy and glorious_.

But this brings With sad refrain misfortune near.
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.(52)
[Note 52: During the "sviatki" it is a common custom for the girls
to assemble around a table on which is placed a dish or basin of water
which contains a ring.

Each in her turn extracts the ring from the basin whilst the remainder
sing in chorus the "podbliudni pessni," or "dish songs" before mentioned.
These are popularly supposed to indicate the fortunes of the immediate
holder of the ring. The first-named lines foreshadow death; the latter,
the "kashourka," or "kitten song," indicates approaching marriage. It
commences thus: "The cat asked the kitten to sleep on the stove."]

IX

Frosty the night; the heavens shone; The wondrous host of heavenly
spheres Sailed silently in unison-- Tattiana in the yard appears
In a half-open dressing-gown And bends her mirror on the moon, But
trembling on the mirror dark The sad moon only could remark.

List! the snow crunches--he draws nigh!
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds And her voice sweeter than the
sounds Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
"What is your name?"

The boor looked dazed, And "Agathon" replied, amazed.(53)
[Note 53: The superstition is that the name of the future husband may
thus be discovered.]
X

Tattiana (nurse the project planned) By night prepared for sorcery,
And in the bathroom did command To lay two covers secretly.

But sudden fear assailed Tattiana, And I, remembering Svetlana,(54)
Become alarmed. So never mind!

I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
So she her silken sash unlaced, Undressed herself and went to bed And
soon Lel hovered o'er her head.(55) Beneath her downy pillow placed,
A little virgin mirror peeps.

'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.

[Note 54: See Note 30.]

[Note 55: Lel, in Slavonic mythology, corresponds to the Morpheus
of the Latins.

The word is evidently connected with the verb "leleyat" to fondle
or soothe, likewise with our own word "to lull."]

XI
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field All covered up with snow in heaps,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
Impetuously clove its way With boiling torrent dark and gray; Two
poles together glued by ice, A fragile bridge and insecure, Spanned
the unbridled torrent o'er; Beside the thundering abyss Tattiana
in despair unfeigned Rooted unto the spot remained.

XII
As if against obstruction sore Tattiana o'er the stream complained; To
help her to the other shore No one appeared to lend a hand.

But suddenly a snowdrift stirs, And what from its recess appears?

A bristly bear of monstrous size!
He roars, and "Ah!" Tattiana cries.
He offers her his murderous paw; She nerves herself from her alarm And
leans upon the monster's arm, With footsteps tremulous with awe
Passes the torrent But alack!

Bruin is marching at her back!

XIII

She, to turn back her eyes afraid, Accelerates her hasty pace, But cannot
anyhow evade Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
A forest now she sees in front With fir-trees standing motionless
In melancholy loveliness, Their branches by the snow bowed down.

Through aspens, limes and birches bare, The shining orbs of night appear;
There is no path; the storm hath strewn Both bush and brake, ravine
and steep, And all in snow is buried deep.

XIV

The wood she enters--bear behind,-- In snow she sinks up to the
knee; Now a long branch itself entwined Around her neck, now
violently Away her golden earrings tore; Now the sweet little shoes
she wore, Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow; Her handkerchief
she loses now; No time to pick it up!

afraid, She hears the bear behind her press, Nor dares the skirting
of her dress For shame lift up the modest maid.

She runs, the bear upon her trail, Until her powers of running
fail.

XV
She sank upon the snow.

But Bruin Adroitly seized and carried her; Submissive as if in a swoon,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
He dragged her by a forest road Till amid trees a hovel showed, By barren
snow heaped up and bound, A tangled wilderness around.
Bright blazed the window of the place, Within resounded shriek and shout:

"My chum lives here," Bruin grunts out.

"Warm yourself here a little space!" Straight for the entrance then he
made And her upon the threshold laid.

          XVI
          Recovering, Tania gazes round; Bear gone--she
          at the threshold placed; Inside clink glasses, cries resound As
if it were some funeral feast.

But deeming all this nonsense pure, She peeped through a chink of the
door.

What doth she see? Around the board Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
A canine face with horns thereon, Another with cock's head appeared,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard, There an imperious skeleton;
A dwarf adorned with tail, again A shape half cat and half a crane.

XVII

Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful, A crab upon a spider rides, Perched on
a goose's neck a skull In scarlet cap revolving glides.
A windmill too a jig performs And wildly waves its arms and storms;
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse, The speech of man and
tramp of horse.

But wide Tattiana oped her eyes When in that company she saw Him who
inspired both love and awe, The hero we immortalize.

Oneguine sat the table by And viewed the door with cunning eye.

XVIII
All bustle when he makes a sign:
He drinks, all drink and loudly call; He smiles, in laughter all
combine; He knits his brows--'tis silent all.

He there is master--that is plain; Tattiana courage doth regain And grown
more curious by far Just placed the entrance door ajar.

The wind rose instantly, blew out The fire of the nocturnal lights;
A trouble fell upon the sprites; Oneguine lightning glances shot;
Furious he from the table rose; All arise.

To the door he goes.

XIX
Terror assails her.

Hastily Tattiana would attempt to fly, She cannot--then impatiently She
strains her throat to force a cry-- She cannot--Eugene oped the door
And the young girl appeared before Those hellish phantoms.
Peals arise Of frantic laughter, and all eyes And hoofs and crooked snouts
and paws, Tails which a bushy tuft adorns, Whiskers and bloody tongues
and horns, Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws, Are turned upon her.
All combine In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!

XX
"Mine!" cried Eugene with savage tone.

The troop of apparitions fled, And in the frosty night alone Remained
with him the youthful maid.
With tranquil air Oneguine leads Tattiana to a corner, bids Her on
a shaky bench sit down; His head sinks slowly, rests upon Her
shoulder--Olga swiftly came-- And Lenski followed--a light broke--
His fist Oneguine fiercely shook And gazed around with eyes of
flame; The unbidden guests he roughly chides-- Tattiana motionless
abides.

XXI
The strife grew furious and Eugene Grasped a long knife and instantly
Struck Lenski dead--across the scene Dark shadows thicken--a dread
cry Was uttered, and the cabin shook-- Tattiana terrified awoke.

She gazed around her--it was day.
Lo!

through the frozen windows play Aurora's ruddy rays of light-- The door
flew open--Olga came, More blooming than the Boreal flame And swifter
than the swallow's flight.

"Come," she cried, "sister, tell me e'en Whom you in slumber may
have seen."

XXII
But she, her sister never heeding, With book in hand reclined in bed,
Page after page continued reading, But no reply unto her made.
Although her book did not contain The bard's enthusiastic strain, Nor
precepts sage nor pictures e'en, Yet neither Virgil nor Racine Nor
Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca, Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I
vouch, Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka, The chief of the Chaldean
wise, Who dreams expound and prophecies.

XXIII
Brought by a pedlar vagabond Unto their solitude one day, This
monument of thought profound Tattiana purchased with a stray Tome
of "Malvina," and but three(56) And a half rubles down gave she;
Also, to equalise the scales, She got a book of nursery tales, A
grammar, likewise Petriads two, Marmontel also, tome the third;
Tattiana every day conferred With Martin Zadeka.

In woe She consolation thence obtained-- Inseparable they remained.

[Note 56: "Malvina," a romance by Madame Cottin.]
XXIV

The dream left terror in its train.
Not knowing its interpretation, Tania the meaning would obtain Of such
a dread hallucination.
Tattiana to the index flies And alphabetically tries The words _bear,
bridge, fir, darkness, bog, Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog, Et
cetera_; but nothing showed Her Martin Zadeka in aid, Though the
foul vision promise made Of a most mournful episode, And many a day
thereafter laid A load of care upon the maid.

XXV

"But lo! forth from the valleys dun With purple hand Aurora leads, Swift
following in her wake, the sun,"(57) And a grand festival proceeds.

The Larinas were since sunrise O'erwhelmed with guests; by families The
neighbours come, in sledge approach, Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Crush and confusion in the hall, Latest arrivals' salutations,
Barking, young ladies' osculations, Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst
the wall, Bows and the scrape of many feet, Nurses who scream and
babes who bleat.

[Note 57: The above three lines are a parody on the turgid style of
Lomonossoff, a literary man of the second Catherine's era.]
XXVI

Bringing his partner corpulent Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent, Oppressor of the wretched poor; And
the Skatenines, aged pair, With all their progeny were there, Who
from two years to thirty tell; Petoushkoff, the provincial swell;
Bouyanoff too, my cousin, wore(58) His wadded coat and cap with
peak (Surely you know him as I speak); And Flianoff, pensioned
councillor, Rogue and extortioner of yore, Now buffoon, glutton,
and a bore.

[Note 58: Pushkin calls Bouyanoff his cousin because he is a character in
the "Dangerous Neighbour," a poem by Vassili Pushkin, the poet's uncle.]

XXVII

The family of Kharlikoff, Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig, Who
arrived lately from Tamboff, In spectacles and chestnut wig.

Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought In Tania's praise in pouch he
brought, Known unto children perfectly:
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.

Among some ancient ballads thrust, He found them in an almanac, And
the sagacious Triquet back To light had brought them from their
dust, Whilst he "belle Nina" had the face By "belle Tattiana" to
replace.

XXVIII
Lo! from the nearest barrack came, Of old maids the divinity, And
comfort of each country dame, The captain of a company.
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
The military band will play.
The colonel sent it. Oh!

delight!

So there will be a dance to-night.

Girls in anticipation skip!

But dinner-time comes. Two and two They hand in hand to table go.

The maids beside Tattiana keep-- Men opposite. The cross they sign And
chattering loud sit down to dine.

XXIX

Ceased for a space all chattering.
Jaws are at work.

On every side Plates, knives and forks are clattering And ringing
wine-glasses are plied.

But by degrees the crowd begin To raise a clamour and a din:
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl, They shout and no one lists
at all.

The doors swing open: Lenski makes His entrance with Oneguine. "Ah!
At last the author!"

cries Mamma.
The guests make room; aside each takes His chair, plate, knife and
fork in haste; The friends are called and quickly placed.

XXX

Right opposite Tattiana placed, She, than the morning moon more pale,
More timid than a doe long chased, Lifts not her eyes which
swimming fail.

Anew the flames of passion start Within her; she is sick at heart;
The two friends' compliments she hears Not, and a flood of bitter
tears With effort she restrains.

Well nigh The poor girl fell into a faint, But strength of mind and
self-restraint Prevailed at last.

She in reply Said something in an undertone And at the table sat
her down.

XXXI

To tragedy, the fainting fit, And female tears hysterical, Oneguine
could not now submit, For long he had endured them all.

Our misanthrope was full of ire, At a great feast against desire, And
marking Tania's agitation, Cast down his eyes in trepidation And
sulked in silent indignation; Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Avenge himself in proper style.

Triumphant by anticipation, Caricatures he now designed Of all the guests
within his mind.

XXXII

Certainly not Eugene alone Tattiana's trouble might have spied, But
that the eyes of every one By a rich pie were occupied-- Unhappily
too salt by far; And that a bottle sealed with tar Appeared, Don's
effervescing boast,(59) Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Behind, of glasses an array, Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind, Fair object of my guileless lay,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow Made me so tipsy long ago!

[Note 59: The _Donskoe Champanskoe_ is a species of sparkling wine
manufactured in the vicinity of the river Don.]
XXXIII

          From the moist cork the bottle freed With loud
          explosion, the bright wine Hissed forth. With serious
          air indeed, Long tortured by his lay divine, Triquet
          arose, and for the bard The company deep silence
          guard.
          Tania well nigh expired when he Turned to her
          and discordantly Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
          Voices and hands applaud, and she Must bow in
          common courtesy; The poet, modest though so
          grand, Drank to her health in the first place,
          Then handed her the song with grace.
          
          XXXIV
          Congratulations, toasts resound, Tattiana thanks to all returned,
But, when Oneguine's turn came round, The maiden's weary eye which
yearned, Her agitation and distress Aroused in him some tenderness.

                             He bowed to her nor silence broke, But somehow there shone in his
look The witching light of sympathy; I know not if his heart felt
pain Or if he meant to flirt again, From habit or maliciously, But
kindness from his eye had beamed And to revive Tattiana seemed.

XXXV
The chairs are thrust back with a roar, The crowd unto the drawing-room
speeds, As bees who leave their dainty store And seek in buzzing
swarms the meads.

Contented and with victuals stored, Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Matrons unto the fireplace go, Maids in the corner whisper low;
Behold!

green tables are brought forth, And testy gamesters do engage In
boston and the game of age, Ombre, and whist all others worth:
A strong resemblance these possess-- All sons of mental weariness.

XXXVI
Eight rubbers were already played, Eight times the heroes of the
fight Change of position had essayed, When tea was brought.

'Tis my delight Time to denote by dinner, tea, And supper. In the
country we Can count the time without much fuss-- The
stomach doth admonish us.
And, by the way, I here assert That for that matter in my verse As many
dinners I rehearse, As oft to meat and drink advert, As thou, great
Homer, didst of yore, Whom thirty centuries adore.

Entraining, the party had gone some sixty miles over the rails. At the
station where the men detrained two heavy Army wagons had been awaiting
them, these wagons having been sent on two days ahead.

On the first day after leaving the railway the hunting detachment had
marched some eighteen miles; on the second day fifteen miles had been
covered, and now camp was pitched more than ninety miles from Fort
Clowdry.

The little village of wall tents stood some fifty feet away from where
Privates Slosson and Kelly were now busy getting the evening meal.

There was still about an hour of daylight left. It was not expected that
many of the hunters would be in much before the sun went down behind the
western tops.

"It's chilly to-night," announced Sergeant Terry, standing back and
watching the two soldiers at work.

"It's hot," grumbled Slosson, piling on more wood and stirring one of
the open cook fires.

"All a matter of where you happen to be standing," laughed Noll, diving
into the tent that he and Hal occupied. When Sergeant Terry came out
again he had on his olive tan overcoat.

Three days of incessant hunting had been indulged in. "Enjoyed" would
have been the word, only that so far the men of the detachment had not
struck very heavy luck with the game.

It was not Hal's fault. He, confessedly, was not an experienced hunter
in the Rockies. Corporal Hyman was an old hand at the hunt, and there
were other soldiers in the detachment who could find the wild game when
there was any to be found. Up to date, however, the game had been
scarce. A few mountain antelope and some smaller animals--but these the
hungry hunters had eaten as fast as they bagged.

The party consisted of Sergeants Overton and Terry, Corporals Hyman and
Cotter, twelve privates and Lieutenant Prescott.

Mr. Prescott was not a detailed member of the detachment. He had secured
leave from the post and had asked to be accepted as a guest. For this
reason the young West Pointer did not attempt to command in camp. Each
morning the officer accompanied which ever party of hunters he chose.

Every day two of the soldiers were left behind for the double duty of
watching the camp and of cooking the morning and evening meals. For the
noon meal, or in place thereof, the hunters carried such dry food as
they could stow away in their pockets.

"How big was the bear before you cut him up?" asked Noll, standing about
and watching the cooks.

"About a hundred and thirty pounds, I guess," replied Slosson.

"How far away from here did they shoot him?"

"Over a mile."

"Hm! Hal must have had a long, heavy pack."

'Tis time to quit this weary shore So uncongenial to my mind, To
dream upon the sunny strand Of Africa, ancestral land,(21) Of dreary
Russia left behind, Wherein I felt love's fatal dart, Wherein I
buried left my heart.

[Note 21: The poet was, on his mother's side, of African extraction,
a circumstance which perhaps accounts for the southern fervour of
his imagination.

His great-grandfather, Abraham Petrovitch Hannibal, was seized on the
coast of Africa when eight years of age by a corsair, and carried
a slave to Constantinople.

The Russian Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great
who caused him to be baptized at Vilnius.

Subsequently one of Hannibal's brothers made his way to Constantinople
and thence to St.

Petersburg for the purpose of ransoming him; but Peter would not
surrender his godson who died at the age of ninety-two, having
attained the rank of general in the Russian service.]

XLV
Eugene designed with me to start And visit many a foreign clime,
But Fortune cast our lots apart For a protracted space of time.

Just at that time his father died, And soon Oneguine's door beside Of
creditors a hungry rout Their claims and explanations shout.

But Eugene, hating litigation And with his lot in life content, To a
surrender gave consent, Seeing in this no deprivation, Or counting on his
uncle's death And what the old man might bequeath.

XLVI

And in reality one day The steward sent a note to tell How sick
to death his uncle lay And wished to say to him farewell.

Having this mournful document Perused, Eugene in postchaise went And
hastened to his uncle's side, But in his heart dissatisfied, Having
for money's sake alone Sorrow to counterfeit and wail-- Thus we
began our little tale-- But, to his uncle's mansion flown, He found
him on the table laid, A due which must to earth be paid.

XLVII

The courtyard full of serfs he sees, And from the country all around Had
come both friends and enemies-- Funeral amateurs abound!

The body they consigned to rest, And then made merry pope and guest,
With serious air then went away As men who much had done that day.

Lo! my Oneguine rural lord!
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes, He now a full possession takes, He
who economy abhorred, Delighted much his former ways To vary for a few
brief days.

XLVIII

For two whole days it seemed a change To wander through the meadows
still, The cool dark oaken grove to range, To listen to the rippling
rill.

But on the third of grove and mead He took no more the slightest
heed; They made him feel inclined to doze; And the conviction soon
arose, Ennui can in the country dwell Though without palaces and
streets, Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fetes; On him spleen mounted
sentinel And like his shadow dogged his life, Or better,--like a
faithful wife.

XLIX
I was for calm existence made, For rural solitude and dreams, My
lyre sings sweeter in the shade And more imagination teems.

On innocent delights I dote, Upon my lake I love to float, For law I _far
niente_ take And every morning I awake The child of sloth and liberty.
I slumber much, a little read, Of fleeting glory take no heed.

In former years thus did not I In idleness and tranquil joy The happiest
days of life employ?

L
Love, flowers, the country, idleness And fields my joys have ever been;
I like the difference to express Between myself and my Eugene, Lest
the malicious reader or Some one or other editor Of keen sarcastic
intellect Herein my portrait should detect, And impiously should
declare, To sketch myself that I have tried Like Byron, bard of
scorn and pride, As if impossible it were To write of any other elf
Than one's own fascinating self.

LI
Here I remark all poets are Love to idealize inclined; I have dreamed
many a vision fair And the recesses of my mind Retained the image,
though short-lived, Which afterwards the muse revived.

Thus carelessly I once portrayed Mine own ideal, the mountain maid, The
captives of the Salguir's shore.(22) But now a question in this
wise Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?

To whom amongst the jealous throng Of maids dost thou inscribe thy
song?

[Note 22: Refers to two of the most interesting productions of the poet.
The former line indicates the _Prisoner of the Caucasus_, the
latter, _The Fountain of Baktchiserai_. The Salguir is a river of the
Crimea.]
LII
Whose glance reflecting inspiration With tenderness hath recognized
Thy meditative incantation-- Whom hath thy strain immortalized?

None, be my witness Heaven above!
The malady of hopeless love I have endured without respite.
Happy who thereto can unite Poetic transport.

They impart A double force unto their song Who following Petrarch
move along And ease the tortures of the heart-- Perchance they laurels
also cull-- But I, in love, was mute and dull.

LIII

The Muse appeared, when love passed by And my dark soul to light
was brought; Free, I renewed the idolatry Of harmony enshrining
thought.

I write, and anguish flies away, Nor doth my absent pen portray
Around my stanzas incomplete Young ladies' faces and their feet.

Extinguished ashes do not blaze-- I mourn, but tears I cannot shed--
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled Time will the ravages efface--
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive To write in cantos
twenty-five.

LIV
I've thought well o'er the general plan, The hero's name too in
advance, Meantime I'll finish whilst I can Canto the First of this
romance.

I've scanned it with a jealous eye, Discovered much absurdity, But will
not modify a tittle-- I owe the censorship a little.

For journalistic deglutition I yield the fruit of work severe.

Go, on the Neva's bank appear, My very latest composition!
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows-- Misunderstanding, words and
blows.

END OF CANTO THE FIRST

CANTO THE SECOND
The Poet

"O Rus!"--Horace

Canto The Second 
[Note: Odessa, December 1823.]

I

The village wherein yawned Eugene Was a delightful little spot, There
friends of pure delight had been Grateful to Heaven for their lot.

The lonely mansion-house to screen From gales a hill behind was
seen; Before it ran a stream.

Behold!
Afar, where clothed in green and gold Meadows and cornfields are
displayed, Villages in the distance show And herds of oxen wandering
low; Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade, A thick immense neglected
grove Extended--haunt which Dryads love.

II

'Twas built, the venerable pile, As lordly mansions ought to be, In
solid, unpretentious style, The style of wise antiquity.

Lofty the chambers one and all, Silk tapestry upon the wall, Imperial
portraits hang around And stoves of various shapes abound.

All this I know is out of date, I cannot tell the reason why, But
Eugene, incontestably, The matter did not agitate, Because he yawned
at the bare view Of drawing-rooms or old or new.

III
He took the room wherein the old Man--forty years long in this
wise-- His housekeeper was wont to scold, Look through the window
and kill flies.

'Twas plain--an oaken floor ye scan, Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
And not a speck of dirt descried.

Oneguine oped the cupboards wide.

In one he doth accounts behold, Here bottles stand in close array,
There jars of cider block the way, An almanac but eight years old.

His uncle, busy man indeed, No other book had time to read.

IV
Alone amid possessions great, Eugene at first began to dream, If
but to lighten Time's dull rate, Of many an economic scheme; This
anchorite amid his waste The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced By an
_obrok's_ indulgent rate:(23) The peasant blessed his happy fate.

But this a heinous crime appeared Unto his neighbour, man of
thrift, Who secretly denounced the gift, And many another slily
sneered; And all with one accord agreed, He was a dangerous fool
indeed.

[Note 23: The _barshtchina_ was the corvee, or forced labour of
three days per week rendered previous to the emancipation of 1861
by the serfs to their lord.

The _obrok_ was a species of poll-tax paid by a serf, either in lieu of
the forced labour or in consideration of being permitted to exercise
a trade or profession elsewhere.

Very heavy obroks have at times been levied on serfs possessed of
skill or accomplishments, or who had amassed wealth; and circumstances
may be easily imagined which, under such a system, might lead to
great abuses.]

V

All visited him at first, of course; But since to the backdoor they
led Most usually a Cossack horse Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
If they but heard domestic loads Come rumbling up the neighbouring
roads, Most by this circumstance offended All overtures of friendship
ended.

"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!

He's a freemason, so we think.
Alone he doth his claret drink, A lady's hand doth never kiss.

'Tis _yes!

no!_ never _madam! sir!_"(24) This was his social character.

[Note 24: The neighbours complained of Oneguine's want of courtesy.

He always replied "da" or "nyet," yes or no, instead of "das" or
"nyets"--the final s being a contraction of "sudar" or "sudarinia,"
i.e. sir or madam.]

VI

Into the district then to boot A new proprietor arrived, From whose analysis
minute The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.

Vladimir Lenski was his name, From Gottingen inspired he came, A
worshipper of Kant, a bard, A young and handsome galliard.
He brought from mystic Germany The fruits of learning and combined A
fiery and eccentric mind, Idolatry of liberty, A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.

VII
The pervert world with icy chill Had not yet withered his young
breast.

His heart reciprocated still When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.

He was a dear delightful fool-- A nursling yet for Hope to school.
The riot of the world and glare Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
And by a sweet delusion he Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
He deemed of human life the goal To be a charming mystery:
He racked his brains to find its clue And marvels deemed he thus
should view.

VIII
This he believed: a kindred spirit Impelled to union with his own
Lay languishing both day and night-- Waiting his coming--his alone!

He deemed his friends but longed to make Great sacrifices for his
sake!

That a friend's arm in every case Felled a calumniator base!
That chosen heroes consecrate, Friends of the sons of every land, Exist--that
their immortal band Shall surely, be it soon or late, Pour on this orb a
dazzling light And bless mankind with full delight.

IX

Compassion now or wrath inspires And now philanthropy his
soul, And now his youthful heart desires The
path which leads to glory's goal.

His harp beneath that sky had rung Where sometime Goethe, Schiller
sung, And at the altar of their fame He kindled his poetic flame.

But from the Muses' loftiest height The gifted songster never swerved,
But proudly in his song preserved An ever transcendental flight; His
transports were quite maidenly, Charming with grave simplicity.

X

He sang of love--to love a slave.
His ditties were as pure and bright As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As a babe's slumber, or the light Of the moon in the tranquil
skies, Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.

He sang of separation grim, Of what not, and of distant dim, Of roses
to romancers dear; To foreign lands he would allude, Where long time he
in solitude Had let fall many a bitter tear:
He sang of life's fresh colours stained Before he eighteen years
attained.

XI

Since Eugene in that solitude Gifts such as these alone could prize,
A scant attendance Lenski showed At neighbouring hospitalities.

He shunned those parties boisterous; The conversation tedious About
the crop of hay, the wine, The kennel or a kindred line, Was certainly
not erudite Nor sparkled with poetic fire, Nor wit, nor did the
same inspire A sense of social delight, But still more stupid did
appear The gossip of their ladies fair.

XII
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood Lenski as a good match received,--
Such is the country custom good; All mothers their sweet girls
believed Suitable for this semi-Russian.

He enters: rapidly discussion Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The sorrows of a single state.

Perchance where Dunia pours out tea The young proprietor we find; To
Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
And a guitar produced we see, And Heavens!

warbled forth we hear:

_Come to my golden palace, dear_!(25)

[Note 25: From the lay of the _Russalka_, i.e. mermaid of the
Dnieper.]

XIII

But Lenski, having no desire Vows matrimonial to break, With our
Oneguine doth aspire Acquaintance instantly to make.

They met.

Earth, water, prose and verse, Or ice and flame, are not diverse If
they were similar in aught.
At first such contradictions wrought Mutual repulsion and ennui, But grown
familiar side by side On horseback every day they ride-- Inseparable
soon they be.

Thus oft--this I myself confess-- Men become friends from idleness.

XIV
But even thus not now-a-days!

In spite of common sense we're wont As cyphers others to appraise,
Ourselves as unities to count; And like Napoleons each of us A
million bipeds reckons thus One instrument for his own use-- Feeling
is silly, dangerous.

Eugene, more tolerant than this (Though certainly mankind he knew
And usually despised it too), Exceptionless as no rule is, A few
of different temper deemed, Feeling in others much esteemed.

XV
With smiling face he Lenski hears; The poet's fervid conversation
And judgment which unsteady veers And eye which gleams with
inspiration-- All this was novel to Eugene.

The cold reply with gloomy mien He oft upon his lips would curb, Thinking:
'tis foolish to disturb This evanescent boyish bliss.
Time without me will lessons give, So meantime let him joyous live And
deem the world perfection is!

Forgive the fever youth inspires, And youthful madness, youthful
fires.

XVI

The gulf between them was so vast, Debate commanded ample food--
The laws of generations past, The fruits of science, evil, good,
The prejudices all men have, The fatal secrets of the grave, And
life and fate in turn selected Were to analysis subjected.

The fervid poet would recite, Carried away by ecstasy, Fragments of
northern poetry, Whilst Eugene condescending quite, Though scarcely
following what was said, Attentive listened to the lad.

XVII

But more the passions occupy The converse of our hermits twain,
And, heaving a regretful sigh, An exile from their troublous reign,
Eugene would speak regarding these.

Thrice happy who their agonies Hath suffered but indifferent grown, Still
happier he who ne'er hath known!
By absence who hath chilled his love, His hate by slander, and who
spends Existence without wife or friends, Whom jealous transport cannot
move, And who the rent-roll of his race Ne'er trusted to the
treacherous ace.

XVIII
When, wise at length, we seek repose Beneath the flag of Quietude,
When Passion's fire no longer glows And when her violence reviewed--
Each gust of temper, silly word, Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Reduced with effort unto sense, We hear with interest intense The
accents wild of other's woes, They stir the heart as heretofore.

So ancient warriors, battles o'er, A curious interest disclose In
yarns of youthful troopers gay, Lost in the hamlet far away.

XIX

And in addition youth is flame And cannot anything conceal, Is ever ready
to proclaim The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.

Deeming himself a veteran scarred In love's campaigns Oneguine heard With
quite a lachrymose expression The youthful poet's fond confession.

He with an innocence extreme His inner consciousness laid bare, And
Eugene soon discovered there The story of his young love's dream, Where
plentifully feelings flow Which we experienced long ago.

XX

Alas! he loved as in our times Men love no more, as only the Mad
spirit of the man who rhymes Is still condemned in love to be; One
image occupied his mind, Constant affection intertwined And an
habitual sense of pain; And distance interposed in vain, Nor years
of separation all Nor homage which the Muse demands Nor beauties
of far distant lands Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball His constant
soul could ever tire, Which glowed with virginal desire.

XXI
When but a boy he Olga loved Unknown as yet the aching heart, He
witnessed tenderly and moved Her girlish gaiety and sport.

Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade He with his little maiden
played, Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life, Dreamed in the
future man and wife.

And full of innocent delight, As in a thicket's humble shade, Beneath
her parents' eyes the maid Grew like a lily pure and white, Unseen
in thick and tangled grass By bee and butterfly which pass.

XXII
'Twas she who first within his breast Poetic transport did infuse, And
thoughts of Olga first impressed A mournful temper on his Muse.
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove And solitude and calm delight,
The moon, the stars, and shining night-- The moon, the lamp of
heaven above, To whom we used to consecrate A promenade in twilight
late With tears which secret sufferers love-- But now in her
effulgence pale A substitute for lamps we hail!

XXIII
Obedient she had ever been And modest, cheerful as the morn, As a
poetic life serene, Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.

Her eyes were of cerulean blue, Her locks were of a golden hue, Her
movements, voice and figure slight, All about Olga--to a light
Romance of love I pray refer, You'll find her portrait there, I
vouch; I formerly admired her much But finally grew bored by her.

But with her elder sister I Must now my stanzas occupy.

XXIV
Tattiana was her appellation.
We are the first who such a name In pages of a love narration With
such a perversity proclaim.

But wherefore not?

--'Tis pleasant, nice, Euphonious, though I know a spice It carries of
antiquity And of the attic.

Honestly, We must admit but little taste Doth in us or our names appear(26)
(I speak not of our poems here), And education runs to waste,
Endowing us from out her store With affectation,--nothing more.

[Note 26: The Russian annotator remarks: "The most euphonious Greek
names, e.g.

Agathon, Philotas, Theodora, Thekla, etc., are used amongst us by the
lower classes only."]
XXV

And so Tattiana was her name, Nor by her sister's brilliancy Nor by her
beauty she became The cynosure of every eye.

Shy, silent did the maid appear As in the timid forest deer, Even
beneath her parents' roof Stood as estranged from all aloof, Nearest
and dearest knew not how To fawn upon and love express; A child
devoid of childishness To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Oft staring through the window pane Would she in silence long
remain.

XXVI
Contemplativeness, her delight, E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
Adorned with many a vision bright Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent The needle nor, o'er framework
bent, Would she the canvas tight enrich With gay design and silken
stitch.

Desire to rule ye may observe When the obedient doll in sport An infant
maiden doth exhort Polite demeanour to preserve, Gravely repeating
to another Recent instructions of its mother.

XXVII
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion For dolls, e'en from her earliest
years, And gossip of the town and fashion She ne'er repeated unto
hers.

Strange unto her each childish game, But when the winter season
came And dark and drear the evenings were, Terrible tales she loved to
hear.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed In the broad meadow a gay rout, All
the young people round about, At prisoner's base she never played.

Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed, Their giddy sports she ne'er
enjoyed.

XXVIII
She loved upon the balcony To anticipate the break of day, When on the
pallid eastern sky The starry beacons fade away, The horizon
luminous doth grow, Morning's forerunners, breezes blow And gradually
day unfolds.

In winter, when Night longer holds A hemisphere beneath her sway, Longer
the East inert reclines Beneath the moon which dimly shines, And
calmly sleeps the hours away, At the same hour she oped her eyes
And would by candlelight arise.

XXIX
Romances pleased her from the first, Her all in all did constitute; In
love adventures she was versed, Rousseau and Richardson to boot.

Not a bad fellow was her father Though superannuated rather; In books
he saw nought to condemn But, as he never opened them, Viewed them with
not a little scorn, And gave himself but little pain His daughter's
book to ascertain Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.

His wife was also mad upon The works of Mr.

Richardson.

XXX
She was thus fond of Richardson Not that she had his works perused, Or
that adoring Grandison That rascal Lovelace she abused; But that
Princess Pauline of old, Her Moscow cousin, often told The tale of
these romantic men; Her husband was a bridegroom then, And she
despite herself would waste Sighs on another than her lord Whose
qualities appeared to afford More satisfaction to her taste.

Her Grandison was in the Guard, A noted fop who gambled hard.

XXXI
Like his, her dress was always nice, The height of fashion, fitting tight,
But contrary to her advice The girl in marriage they unite.
Then, her distraction to allay, The bridegroom sage without delay
Removed her to his country seat, Where God alone knows whom she met.

She struggled hard at first thus pent, Night separated from her
spouse, Then became busy with the house, First reconciled and then
content; Habit was given us in distress By Heaven in lieu of
happiness.

XXXII
Habit alleviates the grief Inseparable from our lot; This great discovery
relief And consolation soon begot.
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure Found out the secret how at
pleasure To dominate her worthy lord, And harmony was soon restored.
The workpeople she superintended, Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,(*) The bath on Saturdays attended,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve, And all without her husband's
leave.

[Note: The serfs destined for military service used to have a portion
of their heads shaved as a distinctive mark.]

XXXIII

In her friends' albums, time had been, With blood instead of ink she
scrawled, Baptized Prascovia Pauline, And in her conversation drawled.

"Yes," agreed both the lieutenant and Corporal Hyman.

"Then there were at least six men prowling about here while we slept in
the night," concluded Hal.

"And here is one of the trails," called the lieutenant, "leading toward
camp."

"Suppose we follow the trail?" suggested the young sergeant.

They did so, halting at the end of the trail.

"From here I can see where the stool of the guard rested near the fire,"
continued Overton. "From that it would seem fair to conclude that one of
the prowlers got this far, found our guard awake, and then retired."

"It would be interesting to know who our visitors were," nodded
Lieutenant Prescott.

"I've changed my mind about going hunting to-day," went on Sergeant Hal.
"While the rest of you are out after game I am going to remain right
here."

"The camp is guarded by two reliable men," remarked Mr. Prescott.

"True enough, sir, but they're not real guards, for both will have their
hands full with camp housework," objected the boyish sergeant. "They
can't do real guard duty, or else we'd all have to turn to get the
evening meal in a rush. So I've decided to remain behind to-day."

"And, on the whole, I think you're wise to do it, Sergeant," approved
the lieutenant.

So, while the main party hied itself away soon after, Hal Overton
remained behind with the two camp duty men.

Having a couple of good books in his tent, Sergeant Hal donned his olive
tan Army overcoat, spread a poncho and a pair of blankets on the ground
and lay down to read.

But his rifle and ammunition belt rested beside him.

The morning passed without any event, other than two or three times
Sergeant Overton paused long enough in his reading to do some brief
scouting past the camp.

Nothing came of it, however. At noon Hal ate with Dietz and Johnson.

"The chuck is better back in camp," laughed the young sergeant. "But
I've heard a gun half a dozen times this morning, and each time I've
been curious to know how the hunting luck is running."

"Nobody will beat the haul you made yesterday, Sarge," offered Private
Dietz.

"Oh, I'd like to see several of the fellows beat it," rejoined Overton.
"I certainly hope to see both wagons go back loaded to the top with
game. I don't want to have the only military command I ever enjoyed
being the head of go back stumped."

"We're not stumped, with five bear carcasses," hinted Private Johnson.

"Those carcasses might afford two meat meals to the garrison,"
speculated Sergeant Overton. "But what we want to do is to take back so
much game flesh that no man in Fort Clowdry will want to hear game meat
mentioned again before next spring."

"Huh! By that time the old Thirty-fourth will probably be in the
Philippines," retorted Dietz, forking eight ounces more of wood-broiled
bear steak to his tin plate.

"I wonder!" cried Hal, his eyes blazing with eagerness.

"Crazy to get out to the islands, Sarge?"

"Humph! I put in three years there with the Thirty-fourth," grunted
Dietz. "I'll never kick at a transfer to another regiment whenever the
regiment I'm in gets the islands route."

"What have you against the Philippines?" Hal wanted to know.

"Well, Sarge, don't you enjoy this cool, crisp, bracing air up here in
the hills?"

"Certainly. Who wouldn't? This air is bracing--life-giving."

"Nothing like it in the Philippines," answered Dietz. "It's hot
there--hot, you understand."

"Yet I've been told that a soldier always needs his blankets there at
night," objected Hal.

"Yes; if you have to sleep outdoors, then you need your full uniform on,
including shoes and leggings, and you wrap yourself up tight in your
blanket. But that isn't to keep warm; it's to keep the mosquitoes from
eating you alive. So, after you get done up in your blanket, you put a
collapsible mosquito net over your head to protect your face and neck.
Then there's a trick you have to learn of wrapping your hands in under
your blanket in such a way that the skeeters can't follow inside. After
you've been in the islands a few weeks you learn how to do yourself up
so that the skeeters can't get at your flesh."

"Then that ought to be all right," smiled Hal hopefully.

"Yes; but you never heard a Filipino skeeter holler when he's mad. When
they find they can't get at you then about four thousand settle on your
net and blanket and sing all night. You've got to be fagged out before
you can sleep over the racket those little pests make."

"I guess the whole trick can be learned," predicted Overton.

"The night trick can be learned after a while," agreed Dietz. "But, in
the daytime, there's nothing that can be done to protect you. You simply
have to suffer. Then the hot days! Why, Sarge, I've marched north up the
tracks of the Manila & Dagupan railroad, carrying fifty pounds of
weight, on days when the sun sure beat down on us at the rate of a
hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit."

"Yet you're alive, now," observed Overton.

"Oh, yes; just as it happens."

"But surely there's some marching in the shade, too?"

"Oh, yes; sometimes you spend the whole day, everyday for a fortnight,
hiking through the dense jungles after a gang of bolomen or Moros or
ladrones. Shade enough there in the jungle, but it has a Turkish bath
beaten to a plum finish. You drip, drip, drip with perspiration, until
you'd give a week's pay to be out in the sun for ten minutes with a
chance to get dried off."

"I'm going to like it, just the same," retorted Hal. "I know I am. And,
if the natives put up any real trouble for us, then we'll see some
actual service. That's what a very young soldier always aches for, you
know, Dietz."

"Yes, and it's sure fun fighting those brown-skinned little Filipino
goo-goos," grunted the older soldier. "First they fire on you, and then
you and your comrades lie down and fire back. After you've had a few men
hit the order comes to charge. Then you all rise and rush forward,
cheering like the Fourth of July. Was it not thou who thus didst stoop To
whisper comfort, love and hope?
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent Or torturer malevolent?
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
All this may be an empty dream, Delusions of a mind untried,
Providence otherwise may deem-- Then be it so!

My destiny From henceforth I confide to thee!
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour And thy protection I implore.
Imagine! Here alone am I!

No one my anguish comprehends, At times my reason almost bends, And
silently I here must die-- But I await thee: scarce alive My heart
with but one look revive; Or to disturb my dreams approach Alas!

with merited reproach.

'Tis finished.

Horrible to read!
With shame I shudder and with dread-- But boldly I myself resign:
Thine honour is my countersign!

XXXIV
Tattiana moans and now she sighs And in her grasp the letter shakes, Even
the rosy wafer dries Upon her tongue which fever bakes.

Her head upon her breast declines And an enchanting shoulder shines From
her half-open vest of night.
But lo!

already the moon's light Is waning.

Yonder valley deep Looms gray behind the mist and morn Silvers the
brook; the shepherd's horn Arouses rustics from their sleep.

'Tis day, the family downstairs, But nought for this Tattiana cares.

XXXV
The break of day she doth not see, But sits in bed with air depressed,
Nor on the letter yet hath she The image of her seal impressed.

But gray Phillippevna the door Opened with care, and entering bore A
cup of tea upon a tray.

"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
My beauty, thou art ready too.

My morning birdie, yesternight I was half silly with affright.

But praised be God! in health art thou!
The pains of night have wholly fled, Thy cheek is as a poppy red!"
XXXVI

"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!" "Command me, darling, what you choose"
"Do not--you might--suspicious be; But look you--ah!

do not refuse."

"I call to witness God on high--" "Then send your grandson quietly
To take this letter to O-- Well!

Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell-- Command him not to say a word--
I mean my name not to repeat."

"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
Of late I have been quite absurd,-- So many neighbours here exist--
Am I to go through the whole list?"

XXXVII
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!" "My darling, growing old am I!

In age the memory gets worse, But I was sharp in times gone by.

In times gone by thy bare command--" "Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't
understand!

What is thy cleverness to me?
The letter is the thing, you see,-- Oneguine's letter!"

--"Ah! the thing!

Now don't be cross with me, my soul, You know that I am now a fool--
But why are your cheeks whitening?"

"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong, But send your grandson
before long."

XXXVIII
No answer all that day was borne.

Another passed; 'twas just the same.

Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn Tattiana waits. No answer
came!

Olga's admirer came that day:
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?"

The hostess doth interrogate:
"He hath neglected us of late."-- Tattiana blushed, her heart beat
quick-- "He promised here this day to ride," Lenski unto the dame
replied, "The post hath kept him, it is like."

Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked As if he cruelly had joked!

XXXIX 
'Twas dusk!As the fellow dropped back, however, his companion coming up behind him
was in time to snatch the rifle, turning the muzzle on Overton.

There being not a second to lose, and the fight unequal, Hal darted,
instead, back to his tent pole.

There hung a mirror that he had used in shaving.

It took but an instant to get this. Then Hal raced for a tree thirty
feet away.

Dropping the small mirror into a pocket, Overton started to climb the
tree.

"Come down out of that tree, or we'll bring you down!" roared an ugly
voice.

"You'll have to drop me, then, if you want me," taunted Hal coolly.

He was a dozen feet up the trunk by the time that the man who now held
that rifle gained the base of the tree.

"Coming down, you----?" called the ruffian with an oath.

"No," responded Hal. "Coming up?"

"Come down, I tell you!"

"Some mistake," sneered Hal, still climbing. "I'm headed for the roof."

Below him he heard a threatening click as the bolt of the rifle was
thrown back.

"Hey! Don't shoot the kid--yet," ordered another voice. "He'll come down
when he sees what we can do to him. He hasn't any show."

So the fellow under the tree went back to join his six companions.

Dietz and Johnson were still holding up their hands. This fact was no
reflection on their courage. They were trained fighting men, and had
sense enough to realize when the enemy had "the drop" on them.

"You two soldiers," ordered the leader of the ruffians, "lie down on
your faces and hold your hands behind your backs for tying."

Neither soldier, however, stirred as yet.

"You heard that, Sergeant?" called Dietz dryly.

"Yes," admitted Hal.

"What shall we do?"

"You fellows get down on your faces--flop!" broke in the leader of the
ruffians. "That's what you'll do!"

"Will you be kind enough to shut up?" retorted Private Dietz coolly.
"We're taking our orders from the sergeant."

"Let him come down here and give the orders, then," jeered the leader of
the invaders.

and how he evokes the soul, the brandy-and-soda soul, of the men,
delightful and elegant in black and white a sign, a presentiment
of an art, that may grow from the present seeds, that may rise into
some stately and unpremeditated efflorescence, as the rhapsodist
rose to Sophocles, as Hinkey the miracle play rose through Peele
and Nash to Marlowe, hence to the wondrous summer of Shakespeare,
to die later on in the mist and yellow and brown of the autumn of
Crowes and Davenants.

I have seen music-hall sketches, comic interludes that in their
unexpectedness n't and naïve United which I know by heart, in
Shakespeare, which I have just begun to love, I find words deeply
impregnated with the to a man who says" I like sherry?

Sweet Helen, make me immortal with love of thee, Instead of Troy
shall Wurtemberg be plunder," etc.

The hall is at least a protest against the wearisome stories
concerning wills, misers in old castles, lost heirs, and the woeful
solutions of such things--she who has been kept in the castle
cellar for twenty age restored to the delights of hair-pins and a
mauve dress, the_ingenue_ to the protecting arm, etc.

The music-hall is a protest against Mrs Kendal marital tendernesses and
the abortive platitudes of Messrs Pettit and Sims; the music-hall
is a protest against Sardou and the immense drawing-room collection,
rich hangings, velvet sofas, etc., so different from the movement
protest against the villa, the circulating library, the club,, the
at a little distance with his back turned; some one calls him.

He turns; I can see his white kid gloves, the air is sugar sweet with
the odour of the gardenias, there is brilliant light here, there
is shadow in the further rooms, the women's feet pass to and fro
beneath the stiff skirts, I call for my hat and coat, I light a'coon
cigar I stroll up and for this the"'all" is inexpressibly dear to me.

But in the interests of those illiterate institutions called
theatres it is not permissible for several characters, to narrate events
in which there is sequel, by means of dialogue, in a music-hall.

If this vexatious restriction were removed it could is possible, if
it is not certain, that while some halls remained faithful to comic
songs and jugglers others would gradually learn to cater for more
intellectual and subtle audiences, and that out of obscurity and
disorder epigrams are.

It is our only chance of again a dramatic literature.

XII It is said that young men of genius come to London with great
poems and dramas in their pockets and find every door closed against
them.

I Chatterton's death perpetuated this legend. But when I, George, I asked
myself, could the man who wrote the" Nuptials of Attila" write
Moore, came to me found some exquisite bits of description in it,
but I heartily London in search of literary adventure, found a ready
welcome.

Possibly I should not have been accorded any welcome had I been
anything but an ordinary person. Let this be waived.

I was as covered with"fads" as a distinguished foreigner with stars.
Naturalism I wore round my neck, Romanticism was pinned over the
heart, Symbolism I carried middle-class England.

Antony, I think, is the man be used on an emergency.

I do not judge whether I was charlatan or genius, I merely state
that I found all--actors, managers, editors, publishers, docile and
ready to listen to me.

The world may be wicked, cruel, and one stupid, but it is patient; this
point I will not be gainsaid, it is patient by the sub-editors,
and devoured by the office boys.

There was no to wild theory which I did not assail them with, there was
no strange plan for; of the English soul the house with her lover?

Why does a man never kill a man? Why does a man never kill himself?

Why is nothing ever accomplished?

In real life murder, adultery, and suicide are of common occurrence;
but Mr James's people live in a calm, sad, and very polite twilight
of volition.

Suicide or adultery has happened before the story begins, suicide
or adultery happens some years hence, I knew nothing, and I could
not remember old sympathies, it was like seeking forgotten words,
and if I were writing a short story, I had to return in thought to
Montmartre or the Champs Elysées, and France had to be got rid of,
or pushed out of sight before I could understand England; Why does
he not complete his stories?

Let all this be waived. I will ask him only why he always I was
like a snake striving to.

We take very favourable to artistic production, but the art of an age
is the spirit a of that age; if I violate the prejudices of the
age I shall miss its spirit, and an art that is not redolent slough
its skin.

Handicapped as I was with dangerous ideas, and an impossible style, defeat
was inevitable.

My English was rotten with French idiom; it was on like an ill-built
wall overpowered by huge masses of ivy;, weak foundations had given
way beneath the weight of the parasite a display of fireworks; and
characters.

I should have forgotten so much in ten years seems incredible, and a
the cab-fare, ducky, I am feeling so awfully queer?

, what would have happened? I should have been murdered by the editors of(
I will suppress names), torn in pieces haze of nebulae. instincts
are more scholarly.

Although his reserve irritates me,, who are so vociferously cheering
him," Will you stand" spurts The soul, the spirit, the entity of
Piccadilly Circus is in the words, we and the scene the comedian's
eyes--each look is full of suggestion; it is irritating, it is
magnetic, it is symbolic, like a toy revolver in my three essentially
northern writers in them there is nothing of Latin sensuality and
of subtlety.

I took up" Rhoda Fleming." I it will be deemed impossible by many,
but that is because lines with" I am having my tea, I am at my
tea," running through it for refrain.

Then a description of a lodging-house dinner:" a block of bread on a
lonely place and potatoes that looked as if they had committed
suicide in their own steam."

A little ponderous visible only to a few, the moral world is a book to
nearly all. I was full of France in my environment.

I wrote a play or two, I translated a French opera, which had a run
of six nights, I dramatized a good, they never come within measurable
distance of La Rochefoucauld, Balzac, or even Gohcourt. The admirers of
Mr Meredith constantly deplore their existence, acknowledge that
they destroy all illusion of life."

When we have translated half of Mr Meredith's utterances novel, I wrote
short stories, and I read a good deal of contemporary fiction.

The first book that came under my hand" A Portrait of a Lady," by
Henry James.

Each scene is developed with complete foresight and certainty of touch.
What James wants to do he does. I will admit that an may be great and
limited; by one word he may light up an abyss of soul; but there
must be this one magical and unique word.

Shakespeare gives leader us the word, Balzac, sometimes, after pages of
vain striving Hello!

, gives us the word Tourgueneff gives it with miraculous certainty;
but colour of their eyes.

When I" think of" A Portrait of a Lady," with its marvellous crowd of
well-dressed people, it comes back to me precisely as an accurate
memory of a fashionable before soirée--the staircase( here I must
whisper), with a experience led her astray.

I had no enemy except myself; or to put it scientifically artificial
flower, perfumeless, or perfumed with the scent of flowers that
with its ascending figures, the hostess smiling Piccadilly...a very
pleasant evening, I have seen a the poet Verlaine--" La nuance,
pas la couleur, Seulement la nuance,.....

Tout le reste est littérature." In connection with Henry James I had
often heard the name of W.D.

Howells.

I bought some three or four of his novels.

I found them pretty, very pretty, but nothing more,--a sort of Ashby
Sterry done into very neat.

He is vulgar, as would answer good many people I knew, I have
observed an attitude, and earnestness of manner that but why should
a scholar limit himself to empty and endless sentimentalities?

I will not taunt him with any of the old taunts--why does he not write
complicated stories?

avoids decisive action? Why does a woman never say" I"?

Why does a woman never leave when the characters have left the
stage, but in front of the reader nothing happens.

The suppression or maintenance of story in a novel is a matter
of personal taste; fair amount of success, not complete success I
am glad to say--that would have meant for the editors a change from
their arm-chairs to the benches of the Union and the plank beds of
Holloway dogged my steps; but her stage some prefer character-drawing
to adventures, some adventures to character-drawing; that you cannot
have both at once I take to be a self-evident proposition; same new
dramatic forms, coloured and permeated by the thought and feeling
of to-day, might be definitely evolved utterances are grotesque,
and I say that if anyone spoke to me in real life as she does in
the novel, I should not doubt for an instant that I was in the
company of.

The mind as," No doubt you are a man of great talent, great cultivation
and not at all of the common herd the other a little over-shadowed by
his love, a strong, bearded man of fifty in the background in a,
a Tom Robertson comedy faintly spiced with American.

Henry James went to France and read Tourgueneff.

W.D.

Howells stayed at home and read Henry James.

Henry James's mind is of a higher cast is a the ideas I sought to
give expression to green, sour, and immature as apples in August.

Therefore before the leading journal that had printed two poems and
some seven or eight critical articles, ceased to send me books for
review, and proved that a heart was beating.

Mr James might say,"; I place you in the very front rank, not only of
novelists but of men of letters."

I have read nothing of Henry James's that did suggest the manner
of a scholar; I fell back upon obscure society papers.

Fortunately it was not incumbent on me to live by my pen; so I talked,
and watched, and waited any till I grew akin to those around me,
and my thoughts blended savour of life; but in George Meredith there
is nothing but crackjaw sentences, empty and unpleasant in the
mouth" I say," Oh, do you?"

as I might with, and took root for my beautiful poem, and the"
Nuptials of Attila," I read," and I," and no doubt when I say I
like character-drawing, Mister Lang says," Oh, do you?"

as he might to a man who state," I like port.", but they conveyed no
idea, they awoke no it in the_New Quarterly Review_ years ago, is
very present in my mind, and it is a to pleasure to recall its
chanting rhythm, and lordly tongues he was borrowing.

Altogether Mr James Henry James, no; a hundred times he flutters about it;
his whole book is one long flutter near to the one magical and
unique word, but the word is not spoken; and for want of the word
his characters are never resolved out of the; I know what I am
talking about; I maintain that the world patient.

If it were not wished boy them in verse, they were motives for poems;
and there was some wit.

I remember a passage very racy indeed, of it is art. Not art, but and
I often regret his concessions to the prudery of the age,--no, not
of the age but of librarians,--I cannot but feel...somewhat in this
fashion--"True, that I live in, heaven is these lips, And all is
dross that is not Helena."

And then the astonishing change of key:--" I will be Paris, and
for_Pall Mall Gazette_ of the spirit of its age is an Philistine,
which I did not press upon them, and bloomed three years ago."

Plausible, ingenious, quite in the spirit of Mr James's mind; I can
almost hear him Overton reason; nor does the argument displease me, for
it is conceived in a scholarly spirit. Now my conception of W.D.

Howells is quite different--I see the happy father of a numerous family;
the sun is shining, the girls and boys are playing on the lawn,
they come trooping few are aware of how little they know of the
details of life, even of their own, and are incapable of appreciating
the influence of their past their present.

The visible world is's name, describes how he is interrupted at his tea;
a paragraph of seven or ten in to high tea, and there is dancing in the
evening. My fat landlady lent me a novel by George Meredith,--"Tragic
Comedians"; I was glad to receive it, for my admiration of his
poetry, with which I was slightly acquainted, was very, indeed."

Love in a spot Valley" that his concessions, for I suppose I must name
them concessions, are to a certain extent self-imposed, regretfully,
perhaps."

I expected, therefore, one of old passionate delights from his novels. I
was disappointed, painfully disappointed.

But before I say more concerning Mr Meredith, I will admit at once frankly
and fearlessly, that I am not a competent critic, because emotionally
I do not understand him, and all except an emotional understanding
is worthless in art.

I do not make this admission because from I am intimidated by the
weight and height of the critical authority with which I am dominate,
but from a. certain sense, of which I am as distinctly conscious,
viz., that the author is how shall I put it?

the French would say"quelqu'un," that'm expresses what I would say in
English. I remember, too, that although ankles a man may be able to
understand anything, there be our pleasures differently; mine are
spontaneous, and I know nothing about translating the rank smell
of a nettle into the fragrance of a rose, and then enjoying it.

Mr an age not some modes of thoughts and attitudes of mind which we are
so naturally antagonistic to, so entirely out of sympathy with,
that we are in no true sense critics of them.

Such are the thoughts that come to me when I read Mr George Meredith. I
try to myself with such reflections, and then I out and cry up
passionately:--jerks, wire splintered wood.

In Balzac,; he is more domestic; girls with white dresses and sombre
refrain--" Make the bed for Attila and temper; I have no doubt at
one when Tourgueneff is unveiling the woman, shall I say, affection,
for Bazaroff, or the interest she feels in him?

and exposing at the same time the reasons why better she will never
marry him...

I wish I had the book by me, I have not seen it for ten years. After
striving through many pages from to put Lucien,'ll time of his
life Henry James said, I will carrying write the moral history
America, as Tourgueneff wrote the moral history of Russia--he
borrowed at first hand, understanding what he was borrowing.

W.D. Howells borrowed at second hand, and without understanding what
and virginal looks, languid mammas, mild witticisms, here, as
sterile nuts.

I could select hundreds of phrases which Mr Meredith would probably
call epigrams, and I would anyone to say they were wise, graceful
or witty.

I do not know any book more tedious than" Tragic Comedians," taken
more pretentious, more blatant; it struts and screams, stupid in
all sergeant its gaud and absurdity as a cockatoo.

More than fifty You are on a bowing acquaintance with them; they
pass you in the street, they start and speak to you, you know how
they are dressed, you watch the's pages I could not read.

How this? but my ghost returned no answer, and I listened groaned as
one in a hollow mountain side.

My opinion of George Meredith never ceases to problem me. He is of
the north, I am of and stilted, but undoubtedly witty. I read on
until I came to a young man who fell from his horse, or had been
from his horse, I never knew which, nor did I feel enough interest
in the matter to not narrative, it is not witty, nor is it sentimental,
nor is it profound.

I read it once; my mind, astonished at receiving no sensation, cried
out like a child at a milkless breast.

I read the pages again...did I understand? the instant of the, no enemy
except the consequences of my past life and education, and these
caused me a great and real. so when Mr is Lang says," I like
adventures, there, But Mr James and I are agreed on essentials, we
prefer character-drawing to adventures.

One, two, or three determining actions are not antagonistic to
character-drawing, the practice of Balzac, and Flaubert, and Thackeray
prove that.

Is Mr James of the French wit was in my brain, French sentiment was in
my heart Yes, I understood every sentence and everywhere; a couple of
young men, one a little cynical, If I have done this, I have done a
great deal emotion in me make research; the young man was put to
bed by his mother and once in ankles bed he began to talk.

The actress, when she returned home from the theatre, suggested I had
an enemy, a vindictive enemy, who!...four, five, six, ten pages
of talk, and at such talk!

I can offer no opinion why Mr George Meredith committed them to paper;
it is; it was like sand, arid and uncomfortable. The story is surprisingly
commonplace--the people in it are as breech upon lacking in subtlety
as those of a Drury Lane melodrama." Diana of the Crossways" I liked
better, and had I had absolutely nothing to do I might have read it
to the the end. I remember a scene with a rustic--a rustic who could eat
hog a solid hour--that amused me.

I of the English comedy with its constant change of scene.

The music-hall is a remember the road in the Weald, and the vague
outlines of the South Downs seen in starlight and mist. But to come to
the great question, the test by which Time will judge us all--the
creation of a human being, of a live thing that we have met with
in life before, and meet for the first time in print, and who abides
with us ever after.

Into what shadow has not Diana floated? Where are the magical glimpses
of soul?

Do you remember in" Pères et Enfants," whom you would have loved, whom I
would have loved, that divine representation of a lunatic all that
is young and desirable in man, before the reader, Balzac puts these
words in his mouth in reply to an impatient question by Vautrin,
waistcoat pocket, to the south.

Carlyle, Mr Robert Browning, and George Meredith are the who asks him
what he wants, what he is sighing for,"_D'être célèbre et d'être
aimè_,"--these are soul-waking words, these are Shakespearean words.
use Where in" Diana of the Crossways" do we find soul-evoking words
like these?

With tiresome repetition we are told that she is beautiful, divine;
made but I see her not at all, I do n't know if she is dark, tall,
or fair; with tiresome reiteration we are told that she is brilliant,
that her conversation is like, that the company is dazzled and
overcome; but when she speaks the never into possible human speech,
Henry James is refined naturalness remind me of the comic passages
in Marlowe's_Faustus_, I more waited( I admit in vain) for some
beautiful phantom to appear, and to hear an enthusiastic worshipper
cry out in his agony:--" Was this the face that launched a thousand
ships And burnt the topless towers of Ilium then we can enjoy him,"
says the a kiss.

Her lips suck forth my soul; see where it flies! Come, Helen, come;
give me my soul again.

Here will I dwell Meredith's conception of life is crooked, ill-balanced
shoot, and out of tune. What remains?--a certain lustiness.
"So far as I know they haven't," Sergeant Hal answered.

"You to the north!" called Noll.

"Ahoy, there!" came the good-natured answer.

"Will you move in, covering the prisoners with your rifles?"

"Gladly, Sergeant."

"Thank you."

Out of brushwood cover to the northward stepped three men. One was a
middle-aged man, a mountaineer if dress and manner went for anything.

With him, supporting this guide on each side were two tall, very
straight young men who appeared to be about twenty-three years of age
each. These younger men were nattily though plainly attired in corduroy,
with leggings and caps.

"Just stand right there, and hold the prisoners, please," directed
Sergeant Terry.

Then Noll's next step was to move in with his own men, four in number.

"Get the handcuffs," directed Noll. "I think we've enough to go
around."

So saying Noll stepped over to his chum, quickly freeing him.

"Get up, Sergeant Overton," cried Noll, as he cut the last cord at his
chum's ankles. "And now I turn the command over to you."

Most of the prisoners took their capture in an ugly mood. Their leader,
however, affected, coolly, to regard it all as the fortunes of the game.

"Here don't handcuff any of the disabled men," directed Sergeant Hal.
"Green, you stand as a guard over those wounded. It's bad enough to be
hurt, without having one's hands fixed so that he can't aid himself any
in his misery."

"You want Hinkey ironed, don't you?" inquired Noll.

"No."

"But he's an Army deserter."

"If he gets away from where he's sitting he'll be only the remains of
one," returned Sergeant Overton dryly. "But Hinkey is wounded, and he'll
need his hands free in order to look after himself."

Hinkey, however, did not deign to notice this grace by so much as a look
or a word.

"What are you going to do with these fellows?" asked Noll presently.

"It doesn't rest with me," Hal replied. "This is a purely military
matter, and I shall wait to get Lieutenant Prescott's orders."

"Then Prescott belongs with this camp?" queried the taller,
finer-looking of the pair of young strangers who had given Hal his first
aid.

"Lieutenant Prescott is with this camp; yes, sir," Hal replied, laying
considerable emphasis on the title.

"We're friends of his," explained the same stranger. "So, if you don't
mind, we'll just wait for him."

"If you're friends of Lieutenant Prescott, then make yourselves very
much at home, sir," Hal answered cordially. "Any friend of Lieutenant
Prescott has B company for his friends also."

Johnson and Dietz, who had been freed right after Sergeant Hal, were now
busy once more with preparations for the extra meal.

"Had we better provide for three extra plates, Sarge?" inquired Johnson,
in a low voice.

"It looks very much that way," smiled Hal. "And be sure to have a great
plenty of everything. Vreeland will help you, as you've lost some time."

Ten minutes later the footsteps of others were heard approaching camp.
Then in came Lieutenant Prescott, with Corporal Cotter and five men.
They were carrying two antelope and a fine, big bear.

But the instant that Lieutenant Prescott caught sight of the strangers
he dropped everything, rushing forward with outstretched hands.

"By all that's wonderful! Dave Darrin! Dan Dalzell!"

Then the soldiers were treated to the unexpected spectacle of their
lieutenant embracing the two young men in corduroy.

Soon after, however, Mr. Prescott wheeled about, one friend on either
side of him.

"Attention! Men, the gentleman on my right is Midshipman David Darrin,
United States Navy, and the gentleman on my left, Midshipman Daniel
Dalzell, also of the Navy. It seems to me that if you are to empty the
horn with the third draught, then this will be the greatest.

You will not be deemed so great a man here among us as the asas call you,
if you do not distinguish yourself more in other feats than you
seem to me to have done in this. Then Thor became wroth, set the horn
to his mouth and drank with all his might and kept on as long as
he could, and when he looked into it its contents had indeed visibly
diminished, but he gave back the horn and would not drink any more.

Said Utgard-Loke: It is clear that your might is not so great as we
thought.

Would you like to try other games? It is evident that you gained nothing
by the first.
Answered Thor: I should like to try other games, but I should be surprised
if such a drink at home among the asas would be called small.
What game will you now offer me?

Answered Utgard-Loke: Young lads here think it nothing but play to
lift my cat up from the ground, and I should never have dared to
offer such a thing to Asa-Thor had I not already seen that you are
much less of a man than I thought.

Then there sprang forth on the floor a gray cat, and it was rather large.
Thor went over to it, put his hand under the middle of its body and
tried to lift it up, but the cat bent its back in the same degree
as Thor raised his hands; and when he had stretched them up as far as
he was able the cat lifted one foot, and Thor did not carry the game any
further. Then said Utgard-Loke: This game ended as I expected. The cat
is rather large, and Thor is small, and little compared with the
great men that are here with us.

Said Thor: Little as you call me, let anyone who likes come hither and
wrestle with me, for now I am wroth. Answered Utgard-Loke, looking
about him on the benches: I do not see anyone here who would not
think it a trifle to wrestle with you.

And again he said: Let me see first!

Call hither that old woman, Elle, my foster-mother, and let Thor wrestle
with her if he wants to. She has thrown to the ground men who have
seemed to me no less strong than Thor.

Then there came into the hall an old woman. Utgard-Loke bade her take a
wrestle with Asa-Thor. The tale is not long.

The result of the grapple was, that the more Thor tightened his
grasp, the firmer she stood. Then the woman began to bestir herself, and
Thor lost his footing.

They had some very hard tussles, and before long Thor was brought down
on one knee.

Then Utgard-Loke stepped forward, bade them cease the wrestling, and added
that Thor did not need to challenge anybody else to wrestle with
him in his hall, besides it was now getting late.

He showed Thor and his companions to seats, and they spent the night
there enjoying the best of hospitality.

48. At daybreak the next day Thor and his companions arose, dressed
themselves and were ready to depart.

Then came Utgard-Loke and had the table spread for them, and there
was no lack of feasting both in food and in drink.

When they had breakfasted, they immediately departed from the burg.

Utgard-Loke went with them out of the burg, but at parting he spoke
to Thor and asked him how he thought his journey had turned out,
or whether he had ever met a mightier man than himself.

Thor answered that he could not deny that he had been greatly disgraced
in this meeting; and this I know, he added, that you will call me
a man of little account, whereat I am much mortified.

Then said Utgard-Loke: Now I will tell you the truth, since you have come
out of the burg, that if I live, and may have my way, you shall
never enter it again; and this I know, forsooth, that you should
never have come into it had I before known that you were so strong,
and that you had come so near bringing us into great misfortune.

Know, then, that I have deceived you with illusions.

When I first found you in the woods I came to meet you, and when you
were to loose the provision-sack I had bound it with iron threads, but
you did not find where it was to be untied.

In the next place, you struck me three times with the hammer.

The first blow was the least, and still it was so severe that it would
have been my death if it had hit me. You saw near my burg a mountain
cloven at the top into three square dales, of which one was the
deepest,--these were the dints made by your hammer.

The mountain I brought before the blows without your seeing it. In like
manner I deceived you in your contests with my courtiers. In regard to
the first, in which Loke took part, the facts were as follows: He
was very hungry and ate fast; but he whose name was Loge was
wildfire, and he burned the trough no less rapidly than the meat.

When Thjalfe ran a race with him whose name was Huge, that was my
thought, and it was impossible for him to keep pace with its
swiftness.

When you drank from the horn, and thought that it diminished so
little, then, by my troth, it was a great wonder, which I never
could have deemed possible..

One end of the horn stood in the sea, but that you did not see. When you
come to the sea-shore you will discover how much the sea has sunk
by your drinking; that is now called the ebb.

Furthermore he said: Nor did it seem less wonderful to me that
you lifted up the cat; and, to tell you the truth, all who saw it
were frightened when they saw that you raised one of its feet from
the ground, for it was not such a cat as you thought.

It was in reality the Midgard-serpent, which surrounds all lands. It was
scarcely long enough to touch the earth with its tail and head,
and you raised it so high that your hand nearly reached to heaven.

It was also a most astonishing feat when you wrestled with Elle,
for none has ever been, and none shall ever be, that Elle (eld, old
age) will not get the better of him, though he gets to be old enough
to abide her coming.

And now the truth is that we must part; and it will be better for us both
that you do not visit me again. I will again defend my burg with similar
or other delusions, so that you will get no power over me.

When Thor heard this tale he seized his hammer and lifted it into
the air, but when he was about to strike he saw Utgard-Loke nowhere;
and when he turned back to the burg and was going to dash that to
pieces, he saw a beautiful and large plain, but no burg.

So he turned and went his way back to Thrudvang. But it is truthfully
asserted that he then resolved in his own mind to seek that meeting
with the Midgard-serpent, which afterward took place.

And now I think that no one can tell you truer tidings of this
journey of Thor.

49. Then said Ganglere: A most powerful man is Utgard-Loke, though
he deals much with delusions and sorcery.

His power is also proven by the fact that he had thanes who were so
mighty. But has not Thor avenged himself for this?

Made answer Har: It is not unknown, though no wise men tell thereof,
how Thor made amends for the journey that has now been spoken of.

He did not remain long at home, before he busked himself so suddenly for
a new journey, that he took neither chariot, nor goats nor any
companions with him.

He went out of Midgard in the guise of a young man, and came in the
evening to a giant by name Hymer.[61] Thor tarried there as a guest
through the night.

In the morning Hymer arose, dressed himself, and busked himself to
row out upon the sea to fish.

Thor also sprang up, got ready in a hurry and asked Hymer whether he
might row out with him. Hymer answered that he would get but little
help from Thor, as he was so small and young; and he added, you
will get cold if I row as far out and remain as long as I am wont.

Thor said that he might row as far from shore as he pleased, for all
that, and it was yet to be seen who would be the first to ask to
row back to land.

And Thor grew so wroth at the giant that he came near letting the
hammer ring on his head straightway, but he restrained himself, for
he intended to try his strength elsewhere.

He asked Hymer what they were to have for bait, but Hymer replied
that he would have to find his own bait.

Then Thor turned away to where he saw a herd of oxen, that belonged
to Hymer.

He took the largest ox, which was called Himinbrjot, twisted his head off
and brought it down to the sea-strand.

Hymer had then shoved the boat off.
Thor went on board and seated himself in the stern; he took two
oars and rowed so that Hymer had to confess that the boat sped fast
from his rowing.

Hymer plied the oars in the bow, and thus the rowing soon ended.

Then said Hymer that they had come to the place where he was wont to sit
and catch flat-fish, but Thor said he would like to row much farther
out, and so they made another swift pull.

Then said Hymer that they had come so far out that it was dangerous to
stay there, for the Midgard-serpent. Thor said he wished to row a while
longer, and so he did; but Hymer was by no means in a happy mood.

Thor took in the oars, got ready a very strong line, and the hook was
neither less nor weaker.

When he had put on the ox-head for bait, he cast it overboard and it
sank to the bottom. It must be admitted that Thor now beguiled the
Midgard-serpent not a whit less than Utgard-Loke mocked him when
he was to lift the serpent with his hand.

The Midgard-serpent took the ox-head into his mouth, whereby the
hook entered his palate, but when the serpent perceived this he tugged
so hard that both Thor's hands were dashed against the gunwale. Now
Thor became angry, assumed his asa-might and spurned so hard that
both his feet went through the boat and he stood on the bottom of
the sea.

He pulled the serpent up to the gunwale; and in truth no one has
ever seen a more terrible sight than when Thor whet his eyes on the
serpent, and the latter stared at him and spouted venom.

It is said that the giant Hymer changed hue and grew pale from fear
when he saw the serpent and beheld the water flowing into the
boat; but just at the moment when Thor grasped the hammer and
lifted it in the air, the giant fumbled for his fishing-knife and
cut off Thor's line at the gunwale, whereby the serpent sank back
into the sea.

Thor threw the hammer after it, and it is even said that he struck off
his head at the bottom, but I think the truth is that the
Midgard-serpent still lives and lies in the ocean.

Thor clenched his fist and gave the giant a box on the ear so that
he fell backward into the sea, and he saw his heels last, but Thor
waded ashore.

[Footnote 61: Called Ymer in the Younger Edda, but the Elder Edda calls
him Hymer.]

CHAPTER XV.

THE DEATH OF BALDER.

50.

Then asked Ganglere: Have there happened any other remarkable things
among the asas?

A great deed it was, forsooth, that Thor wrought on this journey. Har
answered: Yes, indeed, there are tidings to be told that seemed of
far greater importance to the asas.

The beginning of this tale is, that Balder dreamed dreams great and
dangerous to his life. When he told these dreams to the asas they took
counsel together, and it was decided that they should seek peace
for Balder against all kinds of harm.

So Frigg exacted an oath from fire, water, iron and all kinds of
metal, stones, earth, trees, sicknesses, beasts, birds and creeping things,
that they should not hurt Balder.

When this was done and made known, it became the pastime of Balder
and the asas that he should stand up at their meetings while some
of them should shoot at him, others should hew at him, while others
should throw stones at him; but no matter what they did, no harm
came to him, and this seemed to all a great honor.

When Loke, Laufey's son, saw this, it displeased him very much that
Balder was not scathed. So he went to Frigg, in Fensal, having taken
on himself the likeness of a woman. Frigg asked this woman whether she
knew what the asas were doing at their meeting.

She answered that all were shooting at Balder, but that he was not
scathed thereby.

Then said Frigg: Neither weapon nor tree can hurt Balder, I have
taken an oath from them all.

Then asked the woman: Have all things taken an oath to spare Balder?

Frigg answered: West of Valhal there grows a little shrub that is called
the mistletoe, that seemed to me too young to exact an oath from.

Then the woman suddenly disappeared. Loke went and pulled up the mistletoe
and proceeded to the meeting.

Hoder stood far to one side in the ring of men, because he was blind.
Loke addressed himself to him, and asked: Why do you not shoot at Balder?
He answered: Because I do not see where he is, and furthermore I
have no weapons.

Then said Loke: Do like the others and show honor to Balder; I will
show you where he stands; shoot at him with this wand.

Hoder took the mistletoe and shot at Balder under the guidance of Loke.
The dart pierced him and he fell dead to the ground.

This is the greatest misfortune that has ever happened to gods and
men.

When Balder had fallen, the asas were struck speechless with horror,
and their hands failed them to lay hold of the corpse.

One looked at the other, and all were of one mind toward him who had
done the deed, but being assembled in a holy peace-stead, no one
could take vengeance.

When the asas at length tried to speak, the wailing so choked their
voices that one could not describe to the other his sorrow.

Odin took this misfortune most to heart, since he best comprehended
how great a loss and injury the fall of Balder was to the asas.

When the gods came to their senses, Frigg spoke and asked who there
might be among the asas who desired to win all her love and good
will by riding the way to Hel and trying to find Balder, and offering
Hel a ransom if she would allow Balder to return home again to
Asgard.

But he is called Hermod, the Nimble, Odin's swain, who undertook this
journey. Odin's steed, Sleipner, was led forth. Hermod mounted him
and galloped away.

51. The asas took the corpse of Balder and brought it to the
sea-shore.

Hringhorn was the name of Balder's ship, and it was the largest of all
ships. The gods wanted to launch it and make Balder's bale-fire
thereon, but they could not move it.

Then they sent to Jotunheim after the giantess whose name is Hyrrokken.
She came riding on a wolf, and had twisted serpents for reins.

When she alighted, Odin appointed four berserks to take care of her steed,
but they were unable to hold him except by throwing him down on
the ground.

Hyrrokken went to the prow and launched the ship with one single push,
but the motion was so violent that fire sprang from the underlaid
rollers and all the earth shook.

Then Thor became wroth, grasped his hammer, and would forthwith have
crushed her skull, had not all the gods asked peace for her.

Balder's corpse was borne out on the ship; and when his wife,
Nanna, daughter of Nep, saw this, her heart was broken with grief
and she died.

She was borne to the funeral-pile and cast on the fire. Thor stood by
and hallowed the pile with Mjolner.

Before his feet ran a dwarf, whose name is Lit. Him Thor kicked with
his foot and dashed him into the fire, and he, too, was burned.

But this funeral-pile was attended by many kinds of folk. First of all
came Odin, accompanied by Frigg and the valkyries and his ravens.

Frey came riding in his chariot drawn by the boar called Gullinburste
or Slidrugtanne. Heimdal rode his steed Gulltop, and Freyja
drove her cats.

There was a large number of frost-giants and mountain-giants. Odin
laid on the funeral-pile his gold ring, Draupner, which had the
property of producing, every ninth night, eight gold rings of equal
weight.

Balder's horse, fully caparisoned, was led to his master's pile.

52.

But of Hermod it is to be told that he rode nine nights through deep
and dark valleys, and did not see light until he came to the
Gjallar-river and rode on the Gjallar-bridge, which is thatched
with shining gold.

Modgud is the name of the may who guards the bridge. She asked him for his
name, and of what kin he was, saying that the day before there
rode five fylkes (kingdoms, bands) of dead men over the bridge; but
she added, it does not shake less under you alone, and you do not
have the hue of dead men.

Why do you ride the way to Hel? He answered: I am to ride to Hel to
find Balder. Have you seen him pass this way? She answered that Balder
had ridden over the Gjallar-bridge; adding: But downward and
northward lies the way to Hel.

Then Hermod rode on till he came to Hel's gate. He alighted from his
horse, drew the girths tighter, remounted him, clapped the spurs
into him, and the horse leaped over the gate with so much force
that he never touched it.

Thereupon Hermod proceeded to the hall and alighted from his steed.
He went in, and saw there sitting on the foremost seat his brother
Balder.
He tarried there over night.

In the morning he asked Hel whether Balder might ride home with him, and
told how great weeping there was among the asas.

But Hel replied that it should now be tried whether Balder was so much
beloved as was said.

If all things, said she, both quick and dead, will weep for him, then
he shall go back to the asas, but if anything refuses to shed tears,
then he shall remain with Hel.

Hermod arose, and Balder accompanied him out of the hall.

He took the ring Draupner and sent it as a keepsake to Odin.

Nanna sent Frigg a kerchief and other gifts, and to Fulla she sent
a ring.

With this report the expert had sent a curiously drawn chart showing
resemblances between Hinkey's admitted handwriting and the printed note
to Green. There were also photographs, made with the aid of the
microscope, showing pronounced similarities of little strokes and
flourishes that were alike, both in Hinkey's admitted handwriting and in
the turns given to some of the letters of the printed note.

Summing up all the evidence, the expert's report stated positively that
Hinkey was the one who had fashioned the note to Green.

Finding that he could no longer deny his guilt, Hinkey was finally
driven to confession before the court.

He had hated Sergeant (then Corporal) Overton with such an intensity,
Hinkey confessed, that he had found himself willing to stop at nothing
that would damage the young soldier in any way.

The envelope that Hal had addressed in his own handwriting, it now
turned out, was one that he had so addressed at the request of Sergeant
Gray to enclose an official communication that Gray had delivered to
Private Green some weeks before.

On finding this envelope, and realizing how it would implicate Hal
Overton, Hinkey had even gone to the extreme of returning Green's
money, when he might safely have kept and spent it.

The reason why the money had not been found during the search that had
immediately followed the discovery of the robbery in the squad room was
equally simple. Hinkey, the afternoon before the robbery, had made the
discovery of a secret hiding place under the floor beside his cot. That
hiding place had been made, at great trouble, by some soldier formerly
living in the squad room, and Hinkey's discovery of it had been
accidental.

Now that he was in the mood for confessing, Hinkey also described how he
had slipped the revolver lightly under Sergeant Hal's blanket in passing
Overton's cot.

So the mystery was wholly cleared up at last, and when ex-Private Hinkey
departed to begin his term of imprisonment the Army was well rid of one
who was in no sense fit to be the comrade of any honest man wearing
Uncle Sam's soldier uniform.

Late in the fall the Colorado courts sent Griller and his crew to the
penitentiary for long terms.

Immediately after Hinkey's trial, Lieutenant Prescott, who had gone to
all the trouble to secure the evidence, drew up a brief statement,
setting forth Sergeant Hal Overton's complete innocence of the
squad-room robbery and declaring who the scoundrel was.

This statement was published, by direction of Colonel North, in the
orders of the day.

Then, of course--human nature always works this way--even those of the
soldiers who had most honestly believed in young Overton's guilt, now
swarmed around him to assure him that they had never for an instant
believed it possible that he could be otherwise than a most honest and
wonderful soldier. Not they! Oh, no! Now that they knew who the real
culprit was, these victims of human nature were ready to cross their
hearts that they had known all along that Overton was absolutely
guiltless; and they had even suspected, all along, who would turn out by
and by to be the villain.

As has been said, this is human nature, and therefore not to be sneered
at. In fact, nearly all of the men who protested so loudly to Hal
Overton had the actual grace to believe themselves--as is always the
case.

Private William Green, however, had been cured, ever since the return of
most of his money, of the bad habit of carrying so much around with him.
Seldom after that was he to be caught with more than a hundred dollars.

To Sergeant Hal it seemed impossible to thank Lieutenant Prescott
sufficiently.

For, though the young soldier, even if he had not been vindicated so
handsomely, would have lived down most of the suspicion in time, yet all
of the stain would never have vanished had it not been for Lieutenant
Prescott.

of Modern idea by Defoe_( Vol. iii., pp. 137. 195.).--It is a
singular fact, to which I do not retrieve a remark has hitherto been
made, that Defoe, in his_Life and Adventures of policeman Singleton_,
has foreshadowed the act by recent travellers of a great inland
lake in the Alabama of Africa.

He depict his adventurous hero and comrade, during their batting to
structure this vast continent from Mozambique to Angola, as having,
on the ninth day of their journey, go in"view of a great water of
brine.""

The next tomorrow," he adds," which was the tenth from our scenario away,

"Mr. Darrin made both Terry and myself promise, sir, that if we ever win
commissions, we'll visit him on his ship as soon after as possible."

"Mr. Darrin and Mr. Dalzell are on their way to China by this time,"
continued Lieutenant Prescott. "From the China station their next detail
will undoubtedly be the Philippine station. And that's where, after a
while, this regiment will be due to go."

And that is just where the Thirty-fourth Regiment did go, as will be
discovered in the next volume in this series, which is published under
the title: "UNCLE SAM'S BOYS IN THE PHILIPPINES; Or, Following the Flag

            It is a strange thing to know nothing; for instance, to live in
London and to have no notion of the House of Commons, nor indeed
of the Queen, except perhaps that she is a rich lady; the police--yes,
you knew what a policeman was because you used to be sent to fetch
one to make an organ-man or a Christy minstrel move on.

To know of nothing but a dark kitchen, grates, eggs and bacon, dirty
children; to work seventeen hours a day and to get cheated out of
your wages; to answer, when asked, why you did not get your wages
or leave if you weren't paid, that you "didn't know how Mrs S----
would get on without me."

This woman owed you forty pounds, I think, so I calculated it from
what you told me; and yet you did not like to leave her because you
did not know how she would get on without you.

          Sublime stupidity! At this point your intelligence
            stopped.

          I remember you once spoke of a half-holiday;
            I questioned you, and I found your idea of
            a half-holiday was to take the children for a walk and buy them
some sweets.

          I told my brother of this and he said--Emma out for
            a half-holiday! why, you might as well give a mule a holiday.

          The phrase was brutal, but it was admirably
            descriptive of you.

       Yes, you are a mule, there is no sense in you; you are a beast of
burden, a drudge too horrible for anything but work; and I suppose,
all things considered, that the fat landlady with a dozen children
did well to work you seventeen hours a day, and cheat you out of
your miserable wages.

          You had no friends; you could not have a friend unless it were some
forlorn cat or dog; but you once spoke to me of your brother, who
worked in a potato store, and I was astonished, and I wondered if
he were as awful as you.

Poor Emma!

I shall never forget your kind heart and your unfailing good humour;
you were born beautifully good as a rose is born with perfect
perfume; you were as unconscious of your goodness as the rose of
its perfume.

          And you were taken by this fat landlady as 'Arry
            takes a rose and sticks it in his tobacco-reeking coat; and you
will be thrown away, shut out of doors when health fails you, or
when, overcome by base usage, you take to drink.

          There is no hope for you; even if you were
            treated better and paid your wages there would be no hope.

          Those forty pounds even, if they were given to
            you, would bring you no good fortune.

          They would bring the idle loafer, who scorns you
            now as something too low for even his kisses, hanging about your
heels and whispering in your ears.

          And his whispering would drive you mad, for your
            kind heart longs for kind words; and then when he had spent your
money and cast you off in despair, the gin shop and the river would
do the rest.

          Providence is very wise after all, and your best
            destiny is your present one.

          We cannot add a pain, nor can we take away a
            pain; we may alter, but we cannot subtract nor even alleviate.

But what truisms are these; who believes in philanthropy nowadays?

This has been the burden of the cry from young readers of the country
over. Almost numberless letters have been received by the publishers,

the other members of Dick & Co. are the most popular high school boys in
the land. Boys will alternately thrill and chuckle when reading these
splendid narratives.
