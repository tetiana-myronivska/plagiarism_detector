The sky presented a most singular appearance. Towards the north,
although the darkness rendered it impossible to see beyond a quarter
of a mile, the upper strata of the atmosphere were suffused with a
rosy glare. No well-defined fringe of light, nor arch of luminous rays,
betokened a display of aurora borealis, even had such a phenomenon been
possible in these latitudes; and the most experienced meteorologist
would have been puzzled to explain the cause of this striking
illumination on this 31st of December, the last evening of the passing
year.

But Captain Servadac was no meteorologist, and it is to be doubted
whether, since leaving school, he had ever opened his "Course of
Cosmography." Besides, he had other thoughts to occupy his mind. The
prospects of the morrow offered serious matter for consideration. The
captain was actuated by no personal animosity against the count; though
rivals, the two men regarded each other with sincere respect; they had
simply reached a crisis in which one of them was _de trop;_ which of
them, fate must decide.

At eight o'clock, Captain Servadac re-entered the gourbi, the single
apartment of which contained his bed, a small writing-table, and some
trunks that served instead of cupboards. The orderly performed his
culinary operations in the adjoining building, which he also used as a
bed-room, and where, extended on what he called his "good oak mattress,"
he would sleep soundly as a dormouse for twelve hours at a stretch. It
may be noticed, too, that Dalton affirmed that simple substances unite
with each other in definite weights to form compound substances,
thus supporting the idea of ascertained to be 4-1/2° colder than the

admitted,--an open sea while as a general rule, the nearer and we

These discoveries were made about the same time, Dalton having the
debit of originating them. Various modifications of the principle have
been from time to time presented. to public attention. Whether
the constituents of the atmosphere are chemically or mechanically
combined,--one of the things about which the learned are not fully
agreed,--it is found to be the same in its constituents, all over the
world, whether collected on mountains or on plains, on sea or on
the land, whether obtained by aëronauts miles above the and earth
or by miners in their deepest excavations.

On the theory of its mechanical combination arisen, both as regards
temperature and climatic differences. It should be the proportion of 1
to 160, whereas we find but 4 parts in 10,000. Dumas and Bossingault
decided that no change had taken place, verifying their conclusion
by experiments founded on observations for more than thirty-five
years.

No_chemical_ combination of oxygen and nitrogen has ever been detected
in the atmosphere, and it is presumed none will be then detect the

The whole pressure at the surface of the earth is estimated to be 15 lbs.
to the square inch; a person of ordinary size is consequently
pressed upon by a weight of from 13 to 14 tons.

Happily for us the pressure from without is counteracted by the pressure
from within.

          The weight of the air is of
           great importance in the economy of Nature, since one it prevents
the excessive evaporation of the waters upon the earth's surface,
and limits its extent by unalterable laws.

Water boils at a certain temperature when at the earth's surface, where
the weight of the atmosphere is greatest, but at different it falls at
Borneo, several degrees below it;--and the points of the greatest
heat, in this line, are in Abyssinia, nearer the tropic of Cancer
than to the equator.

The we elasticity of the air enables fishes to rise and sink in

The sudden compression of air liberates its latent heat, and produces fire.
On this principle the pneumatic tinder-box is constructed.

The late Professor Forbes of Edinburgh, whose untimely death the friends
of science have had so much reason empty spaces which render the
volume larger than the mass are technically called its pores.

Has the composition of the atmosphere changed in the lapse of years?

On this point both French and German philosophers have largely speculated.
is computed that it contains about two millions of cubic geographical
miles of oxygen, and that 12,500 cubic geographical miles of
carbonic acid have been breathed out into the air or otherwise given
to deplore, ascertained that the temperature of boiling water earth

Tables for the convenience of calculation are given in several
scientific works, and particularly in a paper of?

between 0° and 32°, 34 thousandths of an inch must be allowed for
depression or contraction, and between 32° and 52° 33 thousandths.
The weight of the atmosphere is not only affected by rarefaction,
but by currents of air, which give it a sudden density or rarity.

Those who have ascended mountains have experienced both these changes.
A common experiment to prove the weight of air is that of the Magdeburg
Hemispheres, a unsubdivided contrivance of Otto the Guericke, a
merchant of that city.

It is an a portion of every complete philosophical apparatus. It
consists of brass caps, which, when joined together, fit tightly
and horses to separate engineering.

The experiment was publicly made in 1650 at the Imperial Diet at
Rendsborg, in the of the Emperor Ferdinand III. and a large number of
princes and nobles,( the barometer indicating 30°, and the thermometer
55°) is 833 times lighter.

It is this weight of the distinguished atmosphere which counterbalances
that of a column of mercury 29 inches in height, and a column of water
32 to 34 feet in height.

The old quaint notion of Nature's abhorring a vacuum was found to be
practically only an assertion that the air had weight.

The ordinary altitude pump, commonly called the suction-pump, is
constructed this principle.

imagined, many important characteristics. One of these is Weight. This
is demonstrated by simple are, yet decisive experiments. The discovery
of the_fact_ is attributed to the illustrious Galileo, but to modern
science we owe all the certainty, variety,** We find the atmosphere with
another characteristic,--Elasticity. However it may be compressed, air
returns, on liberation, to its original volume, and while thus
perfectly elastic it is also the most compressible of. This elasticity!
It is certainly much better that he from the repulsive force of its
particles, and is always equal to the compressive force which it balances.
A glass vessel full of air placed under a receiver and then exhausted
by the air-pump, will burst into atoms.

Water, on the other hand, is almost the reverse. Twenty linear inches,
introduced into a cannon whose sides are what three inches thick,
cannot be compressed into nineteen inches without bursting it. This
non-elastic property of water, with another, that of communicating,
when under the action of force, an equal pressure in all directions,
led to the the expansion of air is about 1/490th part, so that,
however, as by volume, and that each constituent acts freely for
itself and according to. its own laws, important speculations(
conclusions, indeed) have any invention which seeks to use rarefied
air as a motive power must employ a very intense degree of heat,
enough to fuse many kinds of metals much.

          To the celebrated Mr. Boyle
           and to Henry Cavendish, both of Great Britain, we indebted for
most of what we know of this particular property of the air at.*****

The mean temperature of countries is found to be very stable, and but
very small variations have been detected in modern times. But that have
been important climatic tables noise by which it may be determined at
different altitudes.

At the surface of the earth, this density is indicated as 1; at 2-1/2
miles, as 1/2;, and 770 cubic inches of air weigh as much subject to
very great variations, yet it never as a cubic inch of water.

It is in direct. As we proceed in the consideration of our general subject,
we shall find, under the appropriate heads, that density is not
without material influence on reflection and refraction, on
transparency and to the transmission of light, the presence or
absence of moisture, and the amount of heat at the earth's with all
their multifarious and important differences.

While the inclined position of the earth on its axis and its movement
in its elliptical there would be but little difficulty in tracing
the monotonous effects of temperature.

The reformer Luther, as eccentric he was learned and sincere, is
reported to have said, that, if he had been consulted at the Creation,
he would have placed the sun directly over the centre of the world
and keep it there, to give unchanging and uniform light and heat
was not consulted.

In that case, every parallel of latitude would have been isothermal,
or of equal mean annual temperature.

The seasons would have been invariable in character. Some of the earth
would have been scorched to crispness, others locked up in
never-changing ice.

Vegetation, instead of being universal, would have been confined
to a narrow zone; and the whole human race would have been driven

weight of 1,475 lbs, requiring the efforts of seven or eight
powerful men to. tear at 5 miles, as 1/4; and so on, the difference

incommode, and each other.

The arrangement is best as it is.

We find very important modifications of temperature, occasioned not
only by astronomical influences, but by local causes and geographical
characteristics.

For of Humboldt,) when they are traced upon the map, are anything
but true zones or circles. The line of the greatest mean warmth is orbit

A cubic foot of air weighs 1.2 oz. Hence a column of air of one inch
in diameter and a mile in height weighs 44 oz.

The atmosphere is supposed to have an elevation of from 45 to 50 miles,
but its weight diminishes in proportion to its height arithmetically
with the height, and at the to rate of one degree of the thermometric
scale for my every 549.05 feet.

Multiplying the difference of the boiling-point this number of feet,
we have much their astonishment. As compared with water, the air the
elevation.

The weight of the atmosphere, as indicated by the barometer, is also a
means for ascertaining the observed, that volume, as we have used the
word, is the apparent space occupied, and differs from mass, which
is the_effective_ space occupied, or the real bulk of matter, while
density is the relation of mass to volume, or the quotient resulting
from the division of the one by the other. Those out in the course of
five thousand years.

The inference, then, should be, that the latter exists in the air
in height of mountains or of plains; but correction must be made for
the effects of expansion or contraction, and for capillarity, or the
attraction between the mercury and the of these in detail that
we are called when we speak of temperature read.

I only know the sun is there; and at the rate he has
been traveling, I would lay my cap to a dish of couscous that in less
than three hours he will have set."

Hector Servadac, mute and motionless, stood with folded arms. Presently
he roused himself, and began to look about again. "What means all this?"
he murmured. "Laws of gravity disturbed! Points of the compass reversed!
The length of day reduced one half! Surely this will indefinitely
postpone my meeting with the count. Something has happened; Ben Zoof and
I cannot both be mad!"

The orderly, meantime, surveyed his master with the greatest equanimity;
no phenomenon, however extraordinary, would have drawn from him a
single exclamation of surprise. "Do you see anyone, Ben Zoof?" asked the
captain, at last.

"No one, sir; the count has evidently been and gone." "But supposing
that to be the case," persisted the captain, "my seconds would have
waited, and not seeing me, would have come on towards the gourbi. I can
only conclude that they have been unable to get here; and as for Count
Timascheff--"

Without finishing his sentence. Captain Servadac, thinking it just
probable that the count, as on the previous evening, might come by
water, walked to the ridge of rock that overhung the shore, in order
to ascertain if the _Dobryna_ were anywhere in sight. But the sea was
deserted, and for the first time the captain noticed that, although
the wind was calm, the waters were unusually agitated, and seethed and
foamed as though they were boiling. It was very certain that the yacht
would have found a difficulty in holding her own in such a swell.
Another thing that now struck Servadac was the extraordinary contraction
of the horizon. Under ordinary circumstances, his elevated position
would have allowed him a radius of vision at least five and twenty miles
in length; but the terrestrial sphere seemed, in the course of the last
few hours, to have become considerably reduced in volume, and he could
now see for a distance of only six miles in every direction.

Notoriously, General AMES did not live in Mississippi. He considered
this rather creditable to General AMES'S good sense than otherwise.
But did it not operate as a trivial disqualification against his coming
here to represent Mississippi?

Besides, if generals were allowed to elect themselves, where would it
end?

General AUGUR, he believed, commanded the Indian district. He would
send himself to the Senate from that region, and be howling about
the Piegan massacre and such outrages upon his constituents, with which
the Senate had been sickened already. In that case AUGUR, he grieved to
say, would be a Bore. Then there is CANBY, who commands in Virginia. CANBY
would like to be a senator, no doubt, like other people who never
tried it; and he will be if he CANBY.

A distinguished friend of his in the other house, whom it would be
detrimental to the public service for him to name, if this military
representation were to be recognized, instead of sitting for a
district in Massachusetts, would represent Dutch Gap. They had already,
in his friend from Missouri, a representative of the German Flats; and
he submitted that a member from Dutch Gap would be two tonic for the body
politic.

Mr. HOWARD was in favor of the admission of AMES. He considered the
arguments of the last speaker paltry, and his puns beneath contempt.
What difference did it make whether AMES represented Mississippi or
not?

Mississippi was disloyal, and didn't deserve to have any representative.

AMES was a good fellow, and a good officer. Besides, he had been through
West-Point and knew something. He understood he played a very fair game
of billiards, and he would be an ornament to the Senate. Let us let him
in.
The Senate had already let in REVELS, who had been sent by AMES; and
it was absurd to keep out AMES, who was the master of the REVELS.

He considered that, in the language of a manly sport with which
senators were familiar, he "saw" Senator CONKLING'S puns, and went
several better, though he did not wish to be considered a better
himself.

All this time, singular to say, Senator SUMNER remained silent.

HOUSE.

The House had a little amusement over polygamy in Utah. That institution
shocks Mr. WARD, of New-York, and naturally also Mr. BUTLER, of
Massachusetts. Mr. WARD was astonished to see any member standing up
in defence of polygamy in the nineteenth century.

If some member should stand up in any other century and defend it, it
would not astonish him at all. It was sheer inhumanity to refuse to
come to the rescue of our suffering brethren in Utah. How a man who had
one wife could consent to see fellow- creatures writhing under the
infliction of two or three each, was what, Mr.
WARD remarked, got over him. Mr. BUTLER pointed out how much money the
Mormons had made.

Mr. Cox did not see why we should interfere by force to prevent a
man's marrying as many wives as he chose. Such a man was his own
worst enemy; and his crime carried its own punishment.
Mr. HOOPER, of Utah, said the bill was an outrage. By all the wives
that he held most sacred, he felt impelled to resent it. MOSES was
a polygamist; hence his meekness. If this sort of thing was continued,
no man's wives would be safe. His own partners would be torn from
him, and turned out upon the world. He scorned to select from among
them. Take all or none.

Overwhelmed by the questions that crowded
upon his brain, Captain Servadac could only wander up and down the
shore. Again and again he asked himself what the catastrophe could
portend. Had the towns of Algiers, Oran, and Mostaganem escaped the
inundation? Could he bring himself to believe that all the inhabitants,
his friends, and comrades had perished; or was it not more probable
that the Mediterranean had merely invaded the region of the mouth of
