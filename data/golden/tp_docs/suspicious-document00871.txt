THE MAN FROM GLENGARRY

A TALE OF THE OTTAWA


By Ralph Connor


DEDICATION

TO THE MEN OF GLENGARRY WHO IN PATIENCE, IN COURAGE AND IN THE FEAR OF
GOD ARE HELPING TO BUILD THE EMPIRE OF THE CANADIAN WEST THIS BOOK IS
HUMBLY DEDICATED


PREFACE


The solid forests of Glengarry have vanished, and with the forests the
men who conquered them. The manner of life and the type of character to
be seen in those early days have gone too, and forever. It is part of
the purpose of this book to so picture these men and their times that
they may not drop quite out of mind. The men are worth remembering.
They carried the marks of their blood in their fierce passions, their
courage, their loyalty; and of the forest in their patience, their
resourcefulness, their self-reliance. But deeper than all, the mark that
reached down to their hearts' core was that of their faith, for in
them dwelt the fear of God. Their religion may have been narrow, but
no narrower than the moulds of their lives. It was the biggest thing in
them. It may have taken a somber hue from their gloomy forests, but
by reason of a sweet, gracious presence dwelling among them it grew in
grace and sweetness day by day.

In the Canada beyond the Lakes, where men are making empire, the sons
of these Glengarry men are found. And there such men are needed. For
not wealth, not enterprise, not energy, can build a nation into sure
greatness, but men, and only men with the fear of God in their hearts,
and with no other. And to make this clear is also a part of the purpose
of this book.

THE MAN FROM GLENGARRY


CHAPTER I

THE OPEN RIVER


The winter had broken early and the Scotch River was running ice-free
and full from bank to bank. There was still snow in the woods, and with
good sleighing and open rivers every day was golden to the lumbermen
who had stuff to get down to the big water. A day gained now might save
weeks at a chute farther down, where the rafts would crowd one another
and strive for right of way.

Dan Murphy was mightily pleased with himself and with the bit of the
world about him, for there lay his winter's cut of logs in the river
below him snug and secure and held tight by a boom across the mouth,
just where it flowed into the Nation. In a few days he would have his
crib made, and his outfit ready to start for the Ottawa mills. He was
sure to be ahead of the big timber rafts that took up so much space,
and whose crews with unbearable effrontery considered themselves the
aristocrats of the river.

Yes, it was a pleasant and satisfying sight, some three solid miles of
logs boomed at the head of the big water. Suddenly Murphy turned his
face up the river.

"What's that now, d'ye think, LeNware?" he asked.

LeNoir, or "LeNware," as they all called it in that country, was Dan
Murphy's foreman, and as he himself said, "for haxe, for hit (eat),
for fight de boss on de reever Hottawa! by Gar!" Louis LeNoir was a
French-Canadian, handsome, active, hardy, and powerfully built. He had
come from the New Brunswick woods some three years ago, and had wrought
and fought his way, as he thought, against all rivals to the proud
position of "boss on de reever," the topmost pinnacle of a lumberman's
ambition. It was something to see LeNoir "run a log" across the river
and back; that is, he would balance himself upon a floating log, and by
spinning it round, would send it whither he would. At Murphy's question
LeNoir stood listening with bent head and open mouth. Down the river
came the sound of singing. "Don-no me! Ah oui! be dam! Das Macdonald
gang for sure! De men from Glengarrie, les diables! Dey not hout de
reever yet." His boss went off into a volley of oaths--

"They'll be wanting the river now, an' they're divils to fight."

"We give em de full belly, heh? Bon!" said LeNoir, throwing back his
head. His only unconquered rival on the river was the boss of the
Macdonald gang.


     Ho ro, mo nighean donn bhoidheach,
     Hi-ri, mo nighean donn bhoidheach,
     Mo chaileag, laghach, bhoidheach,
        Cha phosainn ach thu.


Down the river came the strong, clear chorus of men's voices, and soon a
"pointer" pulled by six stalwart men with a lad in the stern swung round
the bend into view. A single voice took up the song--


     'S ann tha mo run's na beanntaibh,
     Far bheil mo ribhinn ghreannar,
     Mar ros am fasach shamhraidh
        An gleann fad o shuil.


After the verse the full chorus broke forth again--


     Ho ro, mo nighean, etc.


Swiftly the pointer shot down the current, the swaying bodies and
swinging oars in perfect rhythm with the song that rose and fell with
melancholy but musical cadence. The men on the high bank stood looking
down upon the approaching singers. "You know dem fellers?" said LeNoir.
Murphy nodded. "Ivery divil iv thim--Big Mack Cameron, Dannie Ross,
Finlay Campbell--the redheaded one--the next I don't know, and yes! be
dad! there's that blanked Yankee, Yankee Jim, they call him, an' bad
luck till him. The divil will have to take the poker till him, for he'll
bate him wid his fists, and so he will--and that big black divil is
Black Hugh, the brother iv the boss Macdonald. He'll be up in the camp
beyant, and a mighty lucky thing for you, LeNoir, he is."

"Bah!" spat LeNoir, "Dat beeg Macdonald I mak heem run like one leetle
sheep, one tam at de long Sault, bah! No good!" LeNoir's contempt for
Macdonald was genuine and complete. For two years he had tried to meet
the boss Macdonald, but his rival had always avoided him.

Meantime, the pointer came swinging along. As it turned the point
the boy uttered an exclamation--"Look there!" The song and the rowing
stopped abruptly; the big, dark man stood up and gazed down the river,
packed from bank to bank with the brown saw-logs; deep curses broke from
him. Then he caught sight of the men on the bank. A word of command and
the pointer shot into the shore, and the next moment Macdonald Dubh,
or Black Hugh, as he was sometimes called, followed by his men, was
climbing up the steep bank.

"What the blank, blank, do these logs mean, Murphy?" he demanded,
without pause for salutation.

"Tis a foine avenin' Misther Macdonald," said Murphy, blandly offering
his hand, "an' Hiven bliss ye."

Macdonald checked himself with an effort and reluctantly shook hands
with Murphy and LeNoir, whom he slightly knew. "It is a fery goot
evening, indeed," he said, in as quiet a voice as he could command, "but
I am inquiring about these logs."

"Shure, an' it is a dhry night, and onpolite to kape yez talking here.
Come in wid yez," and much against his will Black Hugh followed Murphy
to the tavern, the most pretentious of a group of log buildings--once
a lumber camp--which stood back a little distance from the river, and
about which Murphy's men, some sixty of them, were now camped.

The tavern was full of Murphy's gang, a motley crew, mostly French
Canadians and Irish, just out of the woods and ready for any devilment
that promised excitement. Most of them knew by sight, and all by
reputation, Macdonald and his gang, for from the farthest reaches of the
Ottawa down the St. Lawrence to Quebec the Macdonald gang of Glengarry
men was famous. They came, most of them, from that strip of country
running back from the St. Lawrence through Glengarry County, known as
the Indian Lands--once an Indian reservation. They were sons of the men
who had come from the highlands and islands of Scotland in the early
years of the last century. Driven from homes in the land of their
fathers, they had set themselves with indomitable faith and courage to
hew from the solid forest, homes for themselves and their children that
none might take from them. These pioneers were bound together by ties of
blood, but also by bonds stronger than those of blood. Their loneliness,
their triumphs, their sorrows, born of their common life-long conflict
with the forest and its fierce beasts, knit them in bonds close and
enduring. The sons born to them and reared in the heart of the pine
forests grew up to witness that heroic struggle with stern nature and to
take their part in it. And mighty men they were. Their life bred in
them hardiness of frame, alertness of sense, readiness of resource,
endurance, superb self-reliance, a courage that grew with peril, and
withal a certain wildness which at times deepened into ferocity. By
their fathers the forest was dreaded and hated, but the sons, with
rifles in hand, trod its pathless stretches without fear, and with their
broad-axes they took toll of their ancient foe. For while in spring and
summer they farmed their narrow fields, and rescued new lands from the
brule; in winter they sought the forest, and back on their own farms or
in "the shanties" they cut sawlogs, or made square timber, their only
source of wealth. The shanty life of the early fifties of last century
was not the luxurious thing of to-day. It was full of privation, for
the men were poorly housed and fed, and of peril, for the making of the
timber and the getting it down the smaller rivers to the big water was
a work of hardship and danger. Remote from the restraints of law and
of society, and living in wild surroundings and in hourly touch with
danger, small wonder that often the shanty-men were wild and reckless.
So that many a poor fellow in a single wild carouse in Quebec, or more
frequently in some river town, would fling into the hands of sharks
and harlots and tavern-keepers, with whom the bosses were sometimes in
league, the earnings of his long winter's work, and would wake to find
himself sick and penniless, far from home and broken in spirit.

Of all the shanty-men of the Ottawa the men of Glengarry, and of
Glengarry men Macdonald's gang were easily first, and of the gang Donald
Bhain Macdonald, or Macdonald More, or the Big Macdonald, for he was
variously known, was not only the "boss" but best and chief. There was
none like him. A giant in size and strength, a prince of broad-axe men,
at home in the woods, sure-footed and daring on the water, free with
his wages, and always ready to drink with friend or fight with foe, the
whole river admired, feared, or hated him, while his own men followed
him into the woods, on to a jam, or into a fight with equal joyousness
and devotion. Fighting was like wine to him, when the fight was worth
while, and he went into the fights his admirers were always arranging
for him with the easiest good humor and with a smile on his face. But
Macdonald Bhain's carousing, fighting days came to an abrupt stop about
three years before the opening of this tale, for on one of his summer
visits to his home, "The word of the Lord in the mouth of his servant
Alexander Murray," as he was wont to say, "found him and he was a new
man." He went into his new life with the same whole-souled joyousness as
had marked the old, and he announced that with the shanty and the river
he was "done for ever more." But after the summer's work was done, and
the logging over, and when the snap of the first frost nipped the leaves
from the trees, Macdonald became restless. He took down his broad-axe
and spent hours polishing it and bringing it to an edge, then he put it
in its wooden sheath and laid it away. But the fever was upon him, ten
thousand voices from the forest were shouting for him. He went away
troubled to his minister. In an hour he came back with the old good
humor in his face, took down the broad-axe again, and retouched it,
lovingly, humming the while the old river song of the Glengarry men--


     Ho ro mo nighean, etc.


He was going back to the bush and to the biggest fight of his life. No
wonder he was glad. Then his good little wife began to get ready his
long, heavy stockings, his thick mits, his homespun smock, and other
gear, for she knew well that soon she would be alone for another
winter. Before long the word went round that Macdonald Bhain was for the
shanties again, and his men came to him for their orders.

But it was not to the old life that Macdonald was going, and he gravely
told those that came to him that he would take no man who could not
handle his axe and hand-spike, and who could not behave himself.
"Behaving himself" meant taking no more whiskey than a man could carry,
and refusing all invitations to fight unless "necessity was laid upon
him." The only man to object was his own brother, Macdonald Dubh, whose
temper was swift to blaze, and with whom the blow was quicker than the
word. But after the second year of the new order even Black Hugh fell
into line. Macdonald soon became famous on the Ottawa. He picked only
the best men, he fed them well, paid them the highest wages, and cared
for their comfort, but held them in strictest discipline. They would
drink but kept sober, they would spend money but knew how much was
coming to them. They feared no men even of "twice their own heavy and
big," but would never fight except under necessity. Contracts began to
come their way. They made money, and what was better, they brought it
home. The best men sought to join them, but by rival gangs and by men
rejected from their ranks they were hated with deepest heart hatred. But
the men from Glengarry knew no fear and sought no favor. They asked only
a good belt of pine and an open river. As a rule they got both, and it
was peculiarly maddening to Black Hugh to find two or three miles of
solid logs between his timber and the open water of the Nation. Black
Hugh had a temper fierce and quick, and when in full flame he was a man
to avoid, for from neither man nor devil would he turn. The only man
who could hold him was his brother Macdonald Bhain, for strong man as
he was, Black Hugh knew well that his brother could with a single swift
grip bring him to his knees.

It was unfortunate that the command of the party this day should have
been Macdonald Dubh's. Unfortunate, too, that it was Dan Murphy and his
men that happened to be blocking the river mouth. For the Glengarry men,
who handled only square timber, despised the Murphy gang as sawlog-men;
"log-rollers" or "mushrats" they called them, and hated them as Irish
"Papishes" and French "Crapeaux," while between Dan Murphy and Macdonald
Dubh there was an ancient personal grudge, and to-day Murphy thought he
had found his time. There were only six of the enemy, he had ten times
the number with him, many of them eager to pay off old scores; and
besides there was Louis LeNoir as the "Boss Bully" of the river. The
Frenchman was not only a powerful man, active with hands and feet, but
he was an adept in all kinds of fighting tricks. Since coming to the
Ottawa he had heard of the big Macdonald, and he sought to meet him. But
Macdonald avoided him once and again till LeNoir, having never known
any one avoiding a fight for any reason other than fear, proclaimed
Macdonald a coward, and himself "de boss on de reever." Now there was
a chance of meeting his rival and of forcing a fight, for the Glengarry
camp could not be far away where the big Macdonald himself would be.
So Dan Murphy, backed up with numbers, and the boss bully LeNoir,
determined that for these Macdonald men the day of settlement had
come. But they were dangerous men, and it would be well to take all
precautions, and hence his friendly invitation to the tavern for drinks.

Macdonald Dubh, scorning to show hesitation, though he suspected
treachery, strode after Murphy to the tavern door and through the crowd
of shanty-men filling the room. They were as ferocious looking a lot
of men as could well be got together, even in that country and in those
days--shaggy of hair and beard, dressed out in red and blue and green
jerseys, with knitted sashes about their waists, and red and blue and
green tuques on their heads. Drunken rows were their delight, and fights
so fierce that many a man came out battered and bruised to death or to
life-long decrepitude. They were sitting on the benches that ran round
the room, or lounging against the bar singing, talking, blaspheming. At
the sight of Macdonald Dubh and his men there fell a dead silence, and
then growls of recognition, but Murphy was not yet ready, and roaring
out "Dh-r-r-i-n-k-s," he seized a couple of his men leaning against the
bar, and hurling them to right and left, cried, "Ma-a-ke room for yer
betthers, be the powers! Sthand up, bhoys, and fill yirsilves!"

Black Hugh and his men lined up gravely to the bar and were straightway
surrounded by the crowd yelling hideously. But if Murphy and his gang
thought to intimidate those grave Highlanders with noise, they were
greatly mistaken, for they stood quietly waiting for their glasses to
be filled, alert, but with an air of perfect indifference. Some eight or
ten glasses were set down and filled, when Murphy, snatching a couple
of bottles from the shelf behind the bar, handed them out to his men,
crying, "Here, ye bluddy thaves, lave the glasses to the gintlemen!"

Always, _always_ I have made you merry. But this was music you _heard_.
Now you have said you wished to know me yourself; to have me come to
dwell in your heart that you might have me understandingly, and
because I ask labor of you for this, you sit here with your hot
tears in your eyes and not a bit of me present in your heart.

Listen!
Am I not there? Yes, just a bit. Now more and more, and now will you
give me up because I make you work a little?"
Well, we all have just this experience and we always feel ashamed of our
discouragements; but even this does not tell us why we should study music.
Some people study it because they have to do so; others because they
love it. Surely it must be best with those who out of their hearts
choose to learn about tones and the messages they tell.

Did you ever notice how people seem willing to stop any employment
if music comes near? Even in the busiest streets of a city the
organ-man will make us listen to his tunes. In spite of the hurry and
the crowd and the jumble of noises, still the organ-tones go
everywhere clear, full, melodious, bidding us heed them.

Perhaps we mark the music with the hand, or walk differently, or
begin to sing with it.

In one way or another the music will make us do something--that
shows its power.

I have seen in many European towns a group of children about the
organ-man,[2] dancing or singing as he played and enjoying every
tune to the utmost.

This taught me that music of every kind has its lover, and that
with a little pains and a little patience the love for music belongs
to all alike, and may be increased if other things do not push it
aside.

Now, one of the first things to be said of music is that it makes happiness,
and what makes happiness is good for us, because happiness not only
lightens the heart, but it is one of the best ways to make the light
come to the face. The moment we study music we learn a severe
lesson, and that is this: There can be no use in our trying to be
musicians unless we are willing to learn perfect order in all the
music-tasks we do.

In this, music is a particularly severe mistress. Nothing slovenly, untidy,
or out of order will do. The count must be absolutely right, not fast
nor slow as our fancy dictates, but even and regular. The hands must do
their task together in a friendly manner; the one never crowding nor
hurrying the other, each willing to yield to the other when the
right moment comes.[3] The feet must never use the pedals so as to
make the harmonies mingle wrongly, but at just the right moment
must make the strings sing together as the composer desires.

The thoughts can never for a single moment wander from the playing;
they must remain faithful, preparing what is to come and commanding
the hands to do exactly the right task in the right way. That shows us,
you see, the second quality and a strict one of music. It will not allow
us to be disorderly, and more than this, it teaches us a habit for order
that will be a gain to us in every other task. Now let us see:

First, we should study music for the happiness it will give us.

Second, we should study music for the order it teaches us.

There is a third reason.

If music gives us happiness, do we not in learning it gain a power to
contribute happiness to others? That is one of the greatest pleasures
in learning.

Not only does the knowledge prove of use and joy to us, but we can
constantly make it useful and joy-giving to others. Does this not teach
us how thankful we should be to all those who live usefully?

And think of all the men who have passed their lives writing beautiful
thoughts, singing out of their very hearts, day after day, all their
life long, for the joy of others forever after.

In our next Talk we shall learn that pure thought, written out of
the heart, is forever a good in the world.

From this we shall learn that to study music rightly is to cultivate in
our own hearts the same good thought which the composer had. Hence the
third reason we can find for studying music is that it makes us
able to help and to cheer others, to help them by willingly imparting
the little knowledge we have, and to cheer them by playing the
beautiful thoughts in tone which we have learned.

These are three great reasons, truly, but there are many others. Let us
speak about one of them. In some of the Talks we are to have we shall
learn that true music comes from a true heart; and that great music--that
is the classics--is the thought of men who are pure and noble,
learned in the way to write, and anxious never to write anything
but the best.

There is plainly a great deal of good to us if we study daily the music
of men such as these.

In this way we are brought in touch with the greatest thought.

This constant presence and influence will mold our thoughts to
greater strength and greater beauty.

When we read the history of music, we shall see that the greatest
composers have always been willing to study in their first days the
master works of their time.

They have strengthened their thoughts by contact with thoughts stronger
than their own, and we may gain in just the same way if we will.

We know now that there are many reasons why it is good for us to study
music. We have spoken particularly of four of these. They are:

First, for the happiness it will give us.

Second, for the order it demands of us.

Third, for the power it gives us to help and cheer others.

Fourth, for the great and pure thought it brings before us and
raises in us.

All these things, are they true, you ask? If the little child had asked
that of the master he would have said:

"These things shalt thou find real because they make thee brave.

And the pain and the drudgery and the hot tears shall be the easier
to bear for this knowledge, which should be strong within thee as a pure
faith."

CHAPTER III.

MUSIC IN THE HEART.

"Raffaello's genius goes directly to the heart."--_Autobiography of Benvenuto
Cellini._[4]
The only true way to learn is by doing. The skill of the hand and the
skill of the thought can be brought out only by use. We shall not
become very skilful, nor very learned, nor very good unless we daily
devote ourselves to tasks--often difficult and unpleasant--which shall
bring to us wisdom, or success, or goodness. None of these things,
nor any other like them, come merely by talking about them. That is
the worst way of all--merely to talk and not to act.

But if we talk truthfully and act with care, we shall gain a great deal.
Pleasant companionship often brings forth thoughts which if we
follow them industriously, lead a long way in a good direction.

I do not know that any one has likened music to a country. But we can
make the comparison, and then it becomes plain that we may either
wander through it, seeing the beautiful things, wondering about
them, and talking over our admiration and our wonder; or we may
join to this a true and an earnest inquiry, which shall give us,
as a reward, the clear understanding of some things which we see.

Let us travel in this way; first, because we shall gain true knowledge by
it, but better still, because we shall thereby learn _in the first
days_ that the truest pleasures and the dearest happinesses are
those for which we have done something; those for which we have
given both of labor and of pains.

One of the wisest little philosophers in the world was Polissena,[5]
and I think she became wise just because she labored. As we become
more and more acquainted with true music we shall learn this: True
music is that which is born in some one's heart.

"All immortal writers speak out of the heart."[6] Nothing could be
truer; and as they speak _out_ of their hearts you may be sure they
intend to speak _into_ ours. Nowhere else. As true music is made in
some one's heart, we must feel it in our own hearts as we play it
or it will mean nothing.

The heart must make it warm, then the beauties of the music will come
out.
It is strange how our moods tell themselves. All we do with our eyes and
with our ears, with the tongue and with the hands, what we do with our
thoughts even, is sure to say of itself whether we are doing with
a willing heart or not.

It is curious that the truth will come out of whatever seems to be a secret,
but curious as it may be, it does come out. We must think of that.

Every one of us knows the difference between doing willingly and unwillingly.
We know that things done with joy and with eagerness are well done
and seem to spring directly from the heart.

Not only that, but they really inspire joy and eagerness in those who
are about us.
_Inspire_ is just the word. Look it up in your dictionary and see that
it means exactly what happens--_to breathe into_--they breathe joy
and happiness _into_ all things else, and it comes out of our
hearts.

Now happiness can be told in many ways: in laughter, in the eyes, in a
game, in a life like that of Polissena's, in anything, but in
nothing that does not win the heart.

As happiness can be shown in anything, it can be shown in music. We can
put happiness into play, likewise we can put happiness into music. And
as much of it as we put into anything will come out. Besides, we might
just as well learn now as at another time, this: Whatever we put
into what we do will come out.

It may be happiness or idleness or hatred or courage; whatever goes into
what we do comes out very plainly. Everything, remember. That means
much. If you should practise for an hour, wishing all the time to
be doing something else, you may be sure that your wish is coming out
of your playing so plainly that every one knows it.

Do you think that is strange? Well, it may be, but it is strictly
true.

No one may be able to explain why and how, but certainly it is true that
as we play our music all that goes on in the heart finds its way
into the head, and the arms, and the hands, into the music, off
through the air, and into the hearts of every one who is listening.

So it is a valuable truth for us to remember, that whatever we put into
our music will come out and we cannot stop it; and other people will
get it, and know what we are by it.

Once we fully understand how music will show forth our inmost feelings
we shall begin to understand its truthfulness and its power, as
well as its beauty. We shall see from our first days that music will
tell the truth. That will help us to understand a little the true
mission of art, "either to state a true thing, or adorn a
serviceable one."[7] The moment we understand this _a very little_
we shall begin to love art. We shall be glad and willing for music
to reveal us, to show the spirit within us, because little by little
with the understanding will come love and reverence for the beautiful
thoughts that are locked up in tones.

Men who want to tell something to very many people, many of whom they
do not know and to whom they cannot go, write down all they have to say
and make a book of it. There are some men, however, who have many
beautiful thoughts which they wish to tell to those who can understand;
these may dwell in their own land or in other lands; in their own time
or in future time. But the message of these men is so beautiful and so
delicate that it cannot be told in words, so they tell it in music.
Then, in their own land and in other lands, in their own day and forever
after, people can find out the delicate thoughts by studying the pages
of the music, seeking _with their hearts_ the thought that came out of
the master's heart.

Do you wonder that composers revere their art? We are told of Chopin
that art was for him a high and holy vocation.[8] Do you wonder? Let me
read you a few words about his devotion: "In order to become a skilful
and able master he studied, without dreaming of the ... fame he would
obtain." "Nothing could be purer, more exalted, than his thoughts,"[9]
because he knew that if his thoughts were not pure the impurity would
come out in his music.

The music that has first been felt in the heart and then written down finds
its way and tells all about the heart, where it was born. When you
play and feel that you are playing from the heart, you may be
sure you are on the right path.

The beautiful thing is, that this is true no matter how simple music
is. The very simplest will tell all about us. Remember, in playing
music, that great and good men have put into tones thoughts which will
be a joy and comfort to the world forever.

Some one of these Talks will be about classic and common music.

But even now I am sure we understand that good music comes from
pure thought, and pure thought comes from a good heart.

That, surely, is clear and simple.

Pure music is earnest and songful. It has meaning in every part. No tone
is without a lofty purpose. That is true music. It is classic from the
heart that is put into it.

By being faithful to our music it will do for us more than we can dream.
Do you know the inscription that used to be over the north gate of the
city of Siena, in Italy?

"Siena opens not only her gates, but her heart to you."

CHAPTER IV.

THE TONES ABOUT US.

"Scientific education ought to teach us to see the invisible as well as
the visible in nature."

--_John Tyndall_.[10]
There used to live in England a famous scientist named Tyndall, who
was interested, among other things, in the study of sound.

He studied sounds of all kinds, made experiments with them, wrote down
what he observed, and out of it all he wrote a book,[11] useful to all
who desire to learn about sound and its nature.

One day, Tyndall and a friend were walking up one of the mountains of
the Alps.[12] As they ascended the path, Tyndall's attention was attracted
by a shrill sound, which seemed to come from the ground at his feet.
Being a trained thinker he was at once curious to know what was the
cause of this.

By looking carefully he found that it came from a myriad of small
insects which swarmed by the side of the path.
Having satisfied himself as to what it was he spoke to his companion
about the shrill tone and was surprised to learn that he could not
hear it.

Tyndall's friend could hear all ordinary sound perfectly well. This,
however, seemed to be sound of such a character as did not reach his
sense of hearing. One who like Tyndall listened carefully to sounds of
all kinds would quickly detect anything uncommon.

This little incident teaches us that sounds may go on about us and
yet we know nothing of them.

Also it teaches us to think about tones, seek them, and in the first days
increase our acquaintance and familiarity with them.

Men of science, who study the different ways in which the mind
works, tell us that habit and also a busy mind frequently make us
unconscious of many things about us.

Sometimes we have not noticed the clock strike, although we have
been in the room on the hour; or some one speaks to us, and because
we are thinking of something else we fail to hear what is said to
us. It certainly is true that very many people do not hear half of
the sounds that go on about them, sounds which, if but heeded, would
teach people a great deal. And of all people, those who study music should
be particularly attentive to sounds of all kinds. Indeed, the only way
to begin a music education is to begin by learning to listen. Robert
Schumann, a German composer, once wrote a set of rules for young
musicians.

As it was Schumann's habit to write only what was absolutely needed we
may be sure he regarded his rules as very important.

There are sixty-eight of them, and the very first has reference to taking
particular notice of the tones about us.

If we learn it from memory we shall understand it better and think
of it oftener.

Besides that, we shall have memorized the serious thought of a truly
good and great man.

This is what he says:

"The cultivation of the ear is of the greatest importance. Endeavor
early to distinguish each tone and key.

Find out the exact tone sounded by the bell, the glass, and the
cuckoo."

There is certainly a good hint in this. Let us follow it day by day,
and we shall see how many are the tones about us which we scarcely
ever notice.

We should frequently listen and find who of us can distinguish the
greatest number of different sounds.

Then we shall learn to listen attentively to sounds and noises. Bit
by bit all sounds, especially beautiful ones, will take on a new and
deeper meaning to us; they will be full of a previously unrecognized
beauty which will teach us to love music more and more sincerely.

In order that we may better understand how sounds are related to each
other we should learn early to sing the major scale so that it
will go readily up and down as a melody.

As we become more and more familiar with it we must think frequently of
its separate tones so as to feel just how each one sounds in the scale,
how it fits in the scale, and just what it says, in fact; we shall then
notice after a while that we can hear the scale with the inner ear,
which is finer and more delicate.[13]
We should have names for the scale-tones like the pretty Italian
syllables, or, if not these, whatever our teacher suggests.

Then we should have a conception of the tones as they are related.
We should learn that every tone of the scale is colored by the
tonic.

Every one gets a character from the tonic which tells us all about
it, because we learn to hear its relation to its principal tone.

In a little while, with patience, we shall be able to hear the scale-tones
in any order we may choose to think them.

That power will be a fine help forever after--we must be sure
to get it in the first days.

Whenever we hear two tones we should try to find them on the piano.
This will make us listen more attentively to the tone sounded by
the clock, the church-bell, the bird, the drinking-glass.

And what a lot there are, like the squeaking door, the cricket, the
noise of the wind and rain, the puff of the engine, and all the
other sounds we hear in a day. Bit by bit, in this way, our familiarity
with tones will grow and we shall be well repaid for all the
trouble.

Gradually we shall become better listeners--but about listening we are to
speak in our next Talk. This, however, may be said now: Let us always
be sure to listen with special care to two tones, calling one the
tonic, or first, of the major scale and finding what degree the
other is, or near what degree it lies.

This will make us better acquainted with the scale and we shall learn
that all the music we have comes out of it.

We must also listen to tones so that we can tell something about them
besides their scale names. We must learn to describe tones, tell whether
they are high or low, sweet or harsh, loud or soft, long or short.

For instance, through the window I can hear a church-bell. Some one is
ringing it slowly so that the tones are long. The tone is not a very
high one (it is G above middle C) and the quality is rich and mellow.
This describes the church-bell tone quite well, and in like manner we may
describe all the sounds we hear.

We should make it a habit often to stand or to sit perfectly still and
to listen to everything that goes on about us. Even in the country,
where all seems as quiet as possible, we shall be surprised at the
great number of sounds.

There are some other tones to which I fear we are prone not to listen.

I mean the tones which the piano makes when we play finger-exercises.

We think perhaps of the finger motion, which is not all; or we think of
nothing, which is very bad; or our thoughts begin to picture other
things even while we play, which is the worst of all, and bit by bit
we actually forget what we are doing. One of the quickest ways to become
unable to hear sounds correctly is to play the piano without thinking
fully of what we are doing. Therefore it must be a rule never to play a
tone without listening acutely to it. If in the first days we determine
to do this and remain faithful to it, we shall always touch the piano
keys carefully, thoughtfully, and reverentially.

Elsewhere we shall have some definite tone lessons for the purpose of
making us familiar with the tones about us. But no rule can exceed in
importance this one, never to make any music unthinkingly.

By care and practice we soon become so skilful as to notice tones with
the readiness we notice colors in the garden. The sense of tone must be
as strong in us as is the sense of color. Then we shall be able to tell
differences of tones which are nearly the same, as readily as we
can now tell two varieties of yellow, for instance. A bit of
perseverance in this and the beauties even of common sounds
shall be revealed to us.

CHAPTER V.

LISTENING.

"You must listen as if listening were your life."--_Phillips
Brooks._[14]
In our last Talk we learned that it was quite possible for sounds
to be about us and yet we not hear them. Sometimes, as in the case
of Tyndall's companion, it is because we are not capable; at other
times, as when the clock strikes and we do not hear, it is because
we are occupied with other things. It is from this latter fact--being
occupied with other things--that we can learn what listening
is.
Listening is not being occupied with other things. It is being
completely attentive to what we are expected to hear.His great body seemed to lose both size and
weight, so lightly did he step on tiptoe. There was no more pause, but
lightly, swiftly, and eagerly he glided upon LeNoir. There was something
terrifying in that swift, cat-like movement. In vain the Frenchman
backed and dodged and tried to guard. Once, twice, Macdonald's fists
fell. LeNoir's right arm hung limp by his side and he staggered back to
the wall helpless. Without an instant's delay, Macdonald had him by the
throat, and gripping him fiercely, began to slowly bend him backward
over his knee. Then for the first time Macdonald spoke:

"LeNoir," he said, solemnly, "the days of your boasting are over. You
will no longer glory in your strength, for now I will break your back to
you."

LeNoir tried to speak, but his voice came in horrible gurgles. His face
was a ghastly greenish hue, lined with purple and swollen veins, his
eyes were standing out of his head, and his breath sobbing in raucous
gasps. Slowly the head went back. The crowd stood in horror-stricken
silence waiting for the sickening snap. Yankee, unable to stand it any
longer, stepped up to his chief, and in a most matter of fact voice
drawled out, "About an inch more that way I guess 'll do the trick, if
he ain't double-jointed."

"Aye," said Macdonald, holding grimly on.

"Tonald,"--Black Hugh's voice sounded faint but clear in the awful
silence--"Tonald--you will not--be killing--him. Remember that now. I
will--never--forgive you--if you will--take that--from my hands."

The cry for vengeance smote Macdonald to the heart, and recalled him to
himself. He paused, threw back his locks from his eyes, then relaxing
his grip, stood up.

"God preserve me!" he groaned, "what am I about?"

For some time he remained standing silent, with head down as if not
quite sure of himself. He was recalled by a grip of his arm. He turned
and saw his nephew, Ranald, at his side. The boy's dark face was pale
with passion.

"And is that all you are going to do to him?" he demanded. Macdonald
gazed at him.

"Do you not see what he has done?" he continued, pointing to his father,
who was still lying propped up on some coats. "Why did you not break his
back? You said you would! The brute, beast!"

He hurled out the words in hot hate. His voice pierced the noise of the
room. Macdonald stood still, gazing at the fierce, dark face in solemn
silence. Then he sadly shook his head.

"My lad, 'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.' It would have pleased me
well, but the hand of the Lord was laid upon me and I could not kill
him."

"Then it is myself will kill him," he shrieked, springing like a wildcat
at LeNoir. But his uncle wound his arms around him and held him fast.
For a minute and more he struggled fiercely, crying to be set free,
till recognizing the uselessness of his efforts he grew calm, and said
quietly, "Let me loose, uncle; I will be quiet." And his uncle set him
free. The boy shook himself, and then standing up before LeNoir said, in
a high, clear voice:

"Will you hear me, LeNoir? The day will come when I will do to you what
you have done to my father, and if my father will die, then by the life
of God [a common oath among the shanty-men] I will have your life for
it." His voice had an unearthly shrillness in it, and LeNoir shrank
back.

"Whist, whist, lad! be quate!" said his uncle; "these are not goot
words." The lad heeded him not, but sank down beside his father on the
floor. Black Hugh raised himself on his elbow with a grim smile on his
face.

"It is a goot lad whatever, but please God he will not need to keep his
word." He laid his hand in a momentary caress upon his boy's shoulder,
and sank back again, saying, "Take me out of this."

Then Macdonald Bhain turned to Dan Murphy and gravely addressed him:

"Dan Murphy, it is an ungodly and cowardly work you have done this day,
and the curse of God will be on you if you will not repent." Then he
turned away, and with Big Mack's help bore his brother to the pointer,
followed by his men, bloody, bruised, but unconquered. But before he
left the room LeNoir stepped forward, and offering his hand, said, "You
mak friends wit' me. You de boss bully on de reever Hottawa."

Macdonald neither answered nor looked his way, but passed out in grave
silence.

Then Yankee Jim remarked to Dan Murphy, "I guess you'd better git them
logs out purty mighty quick. We'll want the river in about two days."
Dan Murphy said not a word, but when the Glengarry men wanted the river
they found it open.

But for Macdonald the fight was not yet over, for as he sat beside his
brother, listening to his groans, his men could see him wreathing his
hands and chanting in an undertone the words, "Vengeance is mine saith
the Lord." And as he sat by the camp-fire that night listening to
Yankee's account of the beginning of the trouble, and heard how his
brother had kept himself in hand, and how at last he had been foully
smitten, Macdonald's conflict deepened, and he rose up and cried aloud:

"God help me! Is this to go unpunished? I will seek him to-morrow." And
he passed out into the dark woods.

After a few moments the boy Ranald slipped away after him to beg that he
might be allowed to go with him to-morrow. Stealing silently through the
bushes he came to where he could see the kneeling figure of his uncle
swaying up and down, and caught the sounds of words broken with groans:

"Let me go, O Lord! Let me go!" He pled now in Gaelic and again in
English. "Let not the man be escaping his just punishment. Grant me
this, O, Lord! Let me smite but once!" Then after a pause came the
words, "'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!' Vengeance is mine! Ay, it
is the true word! But, Lord, let not this man of Belial, this Papish,
escape!" Then again, like a refrain would come the words, "Vengeance is
mine. Vengeance is mine," in ever-deeper agony, till throwing himself on
his face, he lay silent a long time.

Suddenly he rose to his knees and so remained, looking steadfastly
before him into the woods. The wind came sighing through the pines with
a wail and a sob. Macdonald shuddered and then fell on his face again.
The Vision was upon him. "Ah, Lord, it is the bloody hands and feet
I see. It is enough." At this Ranald slipped back awe-stricken to the
camp. When, after an hour, Macdonald came back into the firelight, his
face was pale and wet, but calm, and there was an exalted look in his
eyes. His men gazed at him with wonder and awe in their faces.

"Mercy on us! He will be seeing something," said Big Mack to Yankee Jim.

"Seein' somethin'? What? A bar?" inquired Yankee.

"Whist now!" said Big Mack, in a low voice. "He has the sight. Be quate
now, will you? He will be speaking."

For a short time Macdonald sat gazing into the fire in silence, then
turning his face toward the men who were waiting, he said: "There will
be no more of this. 'Vengeance is mine saith the Lord!' It is not for
me. The Lord will do His own work. It is the will of the Lord." And
the men knew that the last word had been said on that subject, and that
LeNoir was safe.


CHAPTER III

THE MANSE IN THE BUSH


Straight north from the St. Lawrence runs the road through the Indian
Lands. At first its way lies through open country, from which the forest
has been driven far back to the horizon on either side, for along the
great river these many years villages have clustered, with open fields
about them stretching far away. But when once the road leaves the
Front, with its towns and villages and open fields, and passes beyond
Martintown and over the North Branch, it reaches a country where the
forest is more a feature of the landscape. And when some dozen or more
of the crossroads marking the concessions which lead off to east and
west have been passed, the road seems to strike into a different world.
The forest loses its conquered appearance, and dominates everything.
There is forest everywhere. It lines up close and thick along the road,
and here and there quite overshadows it. It crowds in upon the little
farms and shuts them off from one another and from the world outside,
and peers in through the little windows of the log houses looking
so small and lonely, but so beautiful in their forest frames. At the
nineteenth cross-road the forest gives ground a little, for here the
road runs right past the new brick church, which is almost finished, and
which will be opened in a few weeks. Beyond the cross, the road leads
along the glebe, and about a quarter of a mile beyond the corner there
opens upon it the big, heavy gate that the members of the Rev. Alexander
Murray's congregation must swing when they wish to visit the manse. The
opening of this gate, made of upright poles held by auger-holes in a
frame of bigger poles, was almost too great a task for the minister's
seven-year-old son Hughie, who always rode down, standing on the hind
axle of the buggy, to open it for his father. It was a great relief
to him when Long John Cameron, who had the knack of doing things for
people's comfort, brought his ax and big auger one day and made a kind
of cradle on the projecting end of the top bar, which he then weighted
with heavy stones, so that the gate, when once the pin was pulled out
of the post, would swing back itself with Hughie straddled on the top of
it.

It was his favorite post of observation when waiting for his mother to
come home from one of her many meetings. And on this particular March
evening he had been waiting long and impatiently.

Suddenly he shouted: "Horo, mamma! Horo!" He had caught sight of the
little black pony away up at the church hill, and had become so wildly
excited that he was now standing on the top bar frantically waving his
Scotch bonnet by the tails. Down the slope came the pony on the gallop,
for she knew well that soon Lambert would have her saddle off, and that
her nose would be deep into bran mash within five minutes more. But her
rider sat her firmly and brought her down to a gentle trot by the time
the gate was reached.

"Horo, mamma!" shouted Hughie, clambering down to open the gate.

"Well, my darling! have you been a good boy all afternoon?"

"Huh-huh! Guess who's come back from the shanties!"

"I'm sure I can't guess. Who is it?" It was a very bright and very
sweet face, with large, serious, gray-brown eyes that looked down on the
little boy.

"Guess, mamma!"

"Why, who can it be? Big Mack?"

"No!" Hughie danced delightedly. "Try again. He's not big."

"I am sure I can never guess. Whoa, Pony!" Pony was most unwilling to
get in close enough to the gate-post to let Hughie spring on behind his
mother.

"You'll have to be quick, Hughie, when I get near again. There now!
Whoa, Pony! Take care, child!"

Hughie had sprung clean off the post, and lighting on Pony's back just
behind the saddle, had clutched his mother round the waist, while the
pony started off full gallop for the stable.

"Now, mother, who is it?" insisted Hughie, as Lambert, the
French-Canadian man-of-all-work, lifted him from his place.

"You'll have to tell me, Hughie!"

"Ranald!"

"Ranald?"

"Yes, Ranald and his father, Macdonald Dubh, and he's hurted awful bad,
and--"

"Hurt, Hughie," interposed the mother, gently.

"Huh-huh! Ranald said he was hurted."

"Hurt, you mean, Hughie. Who was hurt? Ranald?"

"No; his father was hurted--hurt--awful bad. He was lying down in the
sleigh, and Yankee Jim--"

"Mr. Latham, you mean, Hughie."

"Huh-huh," went on Hughie, breathlessly, "and Yankee--Mr. Latham asked
if the minister was home, and I said 'No,' and then they went away."

"What was the matter? Did you see them, Lambert?"

"Oui" ("Way," Lambert pronounced it), "but dey not tell me what he's
hurt."

The minister's wife went toward the house, with a shadow on her face.
She shared with her husband his people's sorrows. She knew even better
than he the life-history of every family in the congregation. Macdonald
Dubh had long been classed among the wild and careless in the community,
and it weighed upon her heart that his life might be in danger.

"I shall see him to-morrow," she said to herself.

For a few moments she stood on the doorstep looking at the glow in the
sky over the dark forest, which on the west side came quite up to the
house and barn.

"Look, Hughie, at the beautiful tints in the clouds, and see the dark
shadows pointing out toward us from the bush." Hughie glanced a moment.

"Mamma," he said, "I am just dead for supper."

"Oh, not quite, I hope, Hughie. But look, I want you to notice those
clouds and the sky behind them. How lovely! Oh, how wonderful!"

Her enthusiasm caught the boy, and for a few moment she forgot even his
hunger, and holding his mother's hand, gazed up at the western sky. It
was a picture of rare beauty that lay stretched out from the manse back
door. Close to the barn came the pasture-field dotted with huge stumps,
then the brule where the trees lay fallen across one another, over
which the fire had run, and then the solid wall of forest here and there
overtopped by the lofty crest of a white pine. Into the forest in the
west the sun was descending in gorgeous robes of glory. The treetops
caught the yellow light, and gleamed like the golden spires of some
great and fabled city.

"Oh, mamma, see that big pine top! Doesn't it look like windows?" cried
Hughie, pointing to one of the lofty pine crests through which the sky
quivered like molten gold.

"And the streets of the city are pure gold," said the mother, softly.

"Yes, I know," said Hughie, confidently, for to him all the scenes and
stories of the Bible had long been familiar. "Is it like that, mamma?"

"Much better, ever so much better than you can think."

"Oh, mamma, I'm just awful hungry!"

"Come away, then; so am I. What have you got, Jessie, for two very
hungry people?"

"Porridge and pancakes," said Jessie, the minister's "girl," who not
only ruled in the kitchen, but using the kitchen as a base, controlled
the interior economy of the manse.

"Oh, goody!" yelled Hughie; "just what I like." And from the plates of
porridge and the piles of pancakes that vanished from his plate no one
could doubt his word.

Their reading that night was about the city whose streets were of pure
gold, and after a little talk, Hughie and his baby brother were tucked
away safely for the night, and the mother sat down to her never-ending
task of making and mending.

The minister was away at Presbytery meeting in Montreal, and for ten
days his wife would stand in the breach. Of course the elders would take
the meeting on the Sabbath day and on the Wednesday evening, but for all
other ministerial duties when the minister was absent the congregation
looked to the minister's wife. And soon it came that the sick and the
sorrowing and the sin-burdened found in the minister's wife such help
and comfort and guidance as made the absence of the minister seem no
great trial after all. Eight years ago the minister had brought his wife
from a home of gentle culture, from a life of intellectual and artistic
pursuits, and from a circle of loving friends of which she was the pride
and joy, to this home in the forest. There, isolated from all congenial
companionship with her own kind, deprived of all the luxuries and of
many of the comforts of her young days, and of the mental stimulus of
that contact of minds without which few can maintain intellectual life,
she gave herself without stint to her husband's people, with never a
thought of self-pity or self-praise. By day and by night she labored for
her husband and family and for her people, for she thought them hers.
She taught the women how to adorn their rude homes, gathered them into
Bible classes and sewing circles, where she read and talked and wrought
and prayed with them till they grew to adore her as a saint, and to
trust her as a leader and friend, and to be a little like her. And not
the women only, but the men, too, loved and trusted her, and the big
boys found it easier to talk to the minister's wife than to the minister
or to any of his session. She made her own and her children's clothes,
collars, hats, and caps, her husband's shirts and neckties, toiling late
into the morning hours, and all without frown or shadow of complaint,
and indeed without suspicion that any but the happiest lot was hers, or
that she was, as her sisters said, "just buried alive in the backwoods."
Not she! She lived to serve, and the where and how were not hers to
determine. So, with bright face and brave heart, she met her days and
faced the battle. And scores of women and men are living better and
braver lives because they had her for their minister's wife.

But the day had been long, and the struggle with the March wind pulls
hard upon the strength, and outside the pines were crooning softly,
and gradually the brave head drooped till between the stitches she
fell asleep. But not for many minutes, for a knock at the kitchen door
startled her, and before long she heard Jessie's voice rise wrathful.

"Indeed, I'll do no such thing. This is no time to come to the
minister's house."

For answer there was a mumble of words.

"Well, then, you can just wait until morning. She can go in the
morning."

"What is it, Jessie?" The minister's wife came into the kitchen.

"Oh, Ranald, I'm glad to see you back. Hughie told me you had come. But
your father is ill, he said. How is he?"

Ranald shook hands shyly, feeling much ashamed under Jessie's sharp
reproof.

"Indeed, it was Aunt Kirsty that sent me," said Ranald, apologetically.

"Then she ought to have known better," said Jessie, sharply.

"Never mind, Jessie. Ranald, tell me about your father."

"He is very bad indeed, and my aunt is afraid that--" The boy's lip
trembled. Then he went on: "And she thought perhaps you might have some
medicine, and--"

"But what is the matter, Ranald?"

"He was hurted bad--and he is not right wise in his head."

"But how was he hurt?"

Ranald hesitated.

"I was not there--I am thinking it was something that struck him."

"Ah, a tree! But where did the tree strike him?"

"Here," pointing to his breast; "and it is sore in his breathing."

"Well, Ranald, if you put the saddle on Pony, I shall be ready in a
minute."

Jessie was indignant.

"You will not stir a foot this night. You will send some medicine, and
then you can go in the morning."

But the minister's wife heeded her not.

"You are not walking, Ranald?"

"No, I have the colt."

"Oh, that's splendid. We'll have a fine gallop--that is, if the moon is
up."

The picture--a work of great fancy and high feeling, but deficient in
manipulative skill--the artist, a poet in the true sense of the
word, had spent months in dreaming and in joying over.

He found it in the dingiest corner of the octagon-room. His lip quivered
and his chest heaved. He pulled his hat further down on his face, and
walked quickly and quietly out.

We would gladly, indeed, see the octagon-room abolished.

A picture is degraded, and an artist is insulted, by a painting
being hung in this darksome and 'condemned cell.'

The canvas gets a 'jail-bird' stamp, and its character is gone.

In France, at the Palais-Royal, the young artists have a far better
chance. After a stated time, the pictures, which, as the best have
primarily had the best places, change stations with their inferiors;
so that everybody in turn enjoys the advantages of the brightest lights
and the most favourable points of view.

No need, of course, of attempting even the most summary sketch of the
styles and ordinary subjects of the great painters who bear aloft
the banner of the British school of art--of Landseer's glimpses of
the Highlands; or Stanfield's skyey, breezy landscapes; of the quiet
pieces of English rural scenery--meadows, and woodland glades, and
river bits, fresh and rich, and green and natural--of our Lees, our
Creswicks, our Coopers, our Witheringtons, our Redgraves, our
Ausdills; of the classic elegance and elevated sentiment of groups
by our Dyces and our Eastlakes; of the abundance of clever _genre_
subjects--scenes from history or romance--poured in by our Wards,
our Friths, our Pooles, our Elmores, our Eggs; or of--last, not
least--the strange but clever vagaries of that new school, the
pre-Raphaelites, who are startling both Academy and public by the
quaintness of their art-theories, and the vehement intensity of
their style of execution.

All the summer long, the world is free to go and gaze upon them. All
the summer long, the salons are crowded from morning till night--in
the earlier hours, by artists and conscientious amateurs, the humbler
sort of folks, who have daily work to do; in the later, by our old
friends, the staring, _insouciant_, lounging, fashionable mob, whose
carriages and Broughams go creeping lazily round and round Trafalgar
Square.

And at parties and balls, and all such reunions, the exhibition forms a
main topic of discourse. Bashful gentlemen know it for a blessing. Often
and often does it serve as a most creditable lever to break the
ice with.

The newspapers long resound with critical columns apropos of Trafalgar
Square.

You see 'sixth notice' attached to a formidable mass of print, and
read on, or pass on, as you please.
But you distinctly observe, at any rate, the social and conversational,
as well as the artistic importance of the Royal Academy; and you
confess, that a London season would be shorn of its brightest feature
if you shut the gates of the National Gallery.

BILL WILLIAMS:

A STORY OF CALIFORNIA.

It was in the first flush of the Californian fever, when moderate people
talked of making one's fortune in a fortnight, and the more sanguine
believed that golden pokers would soon become rather common, that the
_Betsy Jones_ from London to New Zealand, with myself on board as a
passenger, dropped anchor in the bay of San Francisco, and master and
man turned out for the diggings.

It is my impression that not a soul remained on board but the surgeon,
who was sick, and the negro cook, who wouldn't leave him; and the first
man I met on the deck of the _Go-Ahead_ steamer, which took as up
to Sacramento, was our enterprising captain, clad in a canvas jacket
and trousers, with the gold-washing apparatus, two shirts, and a
tin kettle, slung at his back.

The crew followed his example, and all the passengers. The latter were
some thirty men, from every corner of Britain, and of various birth
and breeding.

There were industrious farm-servants and spendthrift sons of gentlemen
among them.

Some had sailed with money, to purchase land in the southern colony,
some were provided only with their hopes and sinews; but California
was an irresistible temptation to them all, and by general desire,
they had come to try their luck at the washing.

We had mere boys and men of grizzling hair in our company.

Two were married, but they wisely left their wives in San Francisco,
where, having brought with them some spare blankets and crockery,
the ladies improvised a boarding-house, and I believe realised more
than their wandering lords.

Nevertheless, we, one and all, went up the broad river with loftier
expectations than the prudent among us cared to make public.

"Whow-oo-oo-oo-ow" rose the long cry of the pursuer, summoning help, and
drawing nearer.

"Wow-ee-wow," came the shorter, sharper answer from the swamp, but much
nearer than before and more in front. They were trying to head off their
prey.

Ranald tugged at his colt till he got him back with the pony.

"It is a good road," he said, quietly; "you can let the pony go. I will
follow you." He swung in behind the pony, who was now running for dear
life and snorting with terror at every jump.

"God preserve us!" said Ranald to himself. He had caught sight of a dark
form as it darted through the gleam of light in front.

"What did you say, Ranald?" The voice was quiet and clear.

"It is a great pony to run whatever," said Ranald, ashamed of himself.

"Is she not?"

Ranald glanced over his shoulder. Down the road, running with silent,
awful swiftness, he saw the long, low body of the leading wolf flashing
through the bars of moonlight across the road, and the pack following
hard.

"Let her go, Mrs. Murray," cried Ranald. "Whip her and never stop." But
there was no need; the pony was wild with fear, and was doing her best
running.

Ranald meantime was gradually holding in the colt, and the pony drew
away rapidly. But as rapidly the wolves were closing in behind him.
They were not more than a hundred yards away, and gaining every second.
Ranald, remembering the suspicious nature of the brutes, loosened his
coat and dropped it on the road; with a chorus of yelps they paused,
then threw themselves upon it, and in another minute took up the chase.

But now the clearing was in sight. The pony was far ahead, and Ranald
shook out his colt with a yell. He was none too soon, for the pursuing
pack, now uttering short, shrill yelps, were close at the colt's heels.
Lizette, fleet as the wind, could not shake them off. Closer and ever
closer they came, snapping and snarling. Ranald could see them over his
shoulder. A hundred yards more and he would reach his own back lane. The
leader of the pack seemed to feel that his chances were slipping swiftly
away. With a spurt he gained upon Lizette, reached the saddle-girths,
gathered himself in two short jumps, and sprang for the colt's throat.
Instinctively Ranald stood up in his stirrups, and kicking his foot
free, caught the wolf under the jaw. The brute fell with a howl under
the colt's feet, and next moment they were in the lane and safe.

The savage brutes, discouraged by their leader's fall, slowed down
their fierce pursuit, and hearing the deep bay of the Macdonalds' great
deerhound, Bugle, up at the house, they paused, sniffed the air a
few minutes, then turned and swiftly and silently slid into the dark
shadows. Ranald, knowing that they would hardly dare enter the lane,
checked the colt, and wheeling, watched them disappear.

"I'll have some of your hides some day," he cried, shaking his fist
after them. He hated to be made to run.

He had hardly set the colt's face homeward when he heard something
tearing down the lane to meet him. The colt snorted, swerved, and then
dropping his ears, stood still. It was Bugle, and after him came Mrs.
Murray on the pony.

"Oh, Ranald!" she panted, "thank God you are safe. I was afraid
you--you--" Her voice broke in sobs. Her hood had fallen back from her
white face, and her eyes were shining like two stars. She laid her hand
on Ranald's arm, and her voice grew steady as she said: "Thank God, my
boy, and thank you with all my heart. You risked your life for mine. You
are a brave fellow! I can never forget this!"

"Oh, pshaw!" said Ranald, awkwardly. "You are better stuff than I am.
You came back with Bugle. And I knew Liz could beat the pony whatever."
Then they walked their horses quietly to the stable, and nothing more
was said by either of them; but from that hour Ranald had a friend ready
to offer life for him, though he did not know it then nor till years
afterward.


CHAPTER V

FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS


Macdonald Dubh's farm lay about three miles north and west from the
manse, and the house stood far back from the cross-road in a small
clearing encircled by thick bush. It was a hard farm to clear, the
timber was heavy, the land lay low, and Macdonald Dubh did not make as
much progress as his neighbors in his conflict with the forest. Not but
that he was a hard worker and a good man with the ax, but somehow he did
not succeed as a farmer. It may have been that his heart was more in the
forest than in the farm. He was a famous hunter, and in the deer season
was never to be found at home, but was ever ranging the woods with his
rifle and his great deerhound, Bugle.

He made money at the shanties, but money would not stick to his fingers,
and by the time the summer was over most of his money would be gone,
with the government mortgage on his farm still unlifted. His habits
of life wrought a kind of wildness in him which set him apart from the
thrifty, steady-going people among whom he lived. True, the shanty-men
were his stanch friends and admirers, but then the shanty-men, though
well-doing, could hardly be called steady, except the boss of the
Macdonald gang, Macdonald Bhain, who was a regular attendant and stanch
supporter of the church, and indeed had been spoken of for an elder. But
from the church Macdonald Dubh held aloof. He belonged distinctly to the
"careless," though he could not be called irreligious. He had all the
reverence for "the Word of God, and the Sabbath day, and the church"
that characterized his people. All these held a high place in his
esteem; and though he would not presume to "take the books," not being a
member of the church, yet on the Sabbath day when he was at home it was
the custom of the household to gather for the reading of the Word before
breakfast. He would never take his rifle with him through the woods on
the Sabbath, and even when absent from home on a hunting expedition,
when the Sabbath day came round, he religiously kept camp. It is true,
he did not often go to church, and when the minister spoke to him about
this, he always agreed that it was a good thing to go to church. When he
had no better excuse, he would apologize for his absence upon the ground
"that he had not the clothes." The greater part of the trouble was
that he was shy and proud, and felt himself to be different from the
church-going people of the community, and shrank from the surprised
looks of members, and even from the words of approving welcome that
often greeted his presence in church.

It was not according to his desire that Ranald was sent to the manse.
That was the doing of his sister, Kirsty, who for the last ten years
had kept house for him. Not that there was much housekeeping skill about
Kirsty, as indeed any one might see even without entering Macdonald
Dubh's house. Kirsty was big and strong and willing, but she had not
the most elemental ideas of tidiness. Her red, bushy hair hung in wisps
about her face, after the greater part of it had been gathered into a
tight knob at the back of her head. She was a martyr to the "neuralagy,"
and suffered from a perennial cold in the head, which made it necessary
for her to wear a cloud, which was only removed when it could be
replaced by her nightcap. Her face always bore the marks of her labors,
and from it one could gather whether she was among the pots or busy with
the baking. But she was kindhearted, and, up to her light, sought to
fill the place left empty by the death of the wife and mother in that
home, ten years before.

When the minister's wife opened the door, a hot, close, foul smell
rushed forth to meet her. Upon the kitchen stove a large pot of
pig's food was boiling, and the steam and smell from the pot made
the atmosphere of the room overpoweringly fetid. Off the kitchen or
living-room were two small bedrooms, in one of which lay Macdonald Dubh.

Kirsty met the minister's wife with a warm welcome. She helped her
off with her hood and coat, patting her on the shoulder the while, and
murmuring words of endearment.

"Ah, M'eudail! M'eudail bheg! and did you come through the night all the
way, and it is ashamed that I am to have sent for you, but he was very
bad and I was afraid. Come away! come away! I will make you a cup of
tea." But the minister's wife assured Kirsty that she was glad to come,
and declining the cup of tea, went to the room where Macdonald Dubh lay
tossing and moaning with the delirium of fever upon him. It was not long
before she knew what was required.

With hot fomentations she proceeded to allay the pain, and in half an
hour Macdonald Dubh grew quiet. His tossings and mutterings ceased and
he fell into a sleep.

Kirsty stood by admiring.

"Mercy me! Look at that now; and it is yourself that is the great
doctor!"

"Now, Kirsty," said Mrs. Murray, in a very matter-of-fact tone, "we will
just make him a little more comfortable."

"Yes," said Kirsty, not quite sure how the feat was to be achieved. "A
little hot something for his inside will be good, but indeed, many's the
drink I have given him," she suggested.

"What have you been giving him, Kirsty?"

"Senny and dandylion, and a little whisky. They will be telling me it is
ferry good whatever for the stomach and bow'ls."

"I don't think I would give him any more of that; but we will try and
make him feel a little more comfortable."

Mrs. Murray knew she was treading on delicate ground. The Highland pride
is quick to take offense.

"Sick people, you see," she proceeded carefully, "need very frequent
changes--sheets and clothing, you understand."

"Aye," said Kirsty, suspiciously.

"I am sure you have plenty of beautiful sheets, and we will change these
when he wakes from his sleep."

"Indeed, they are very clean, for there is no one but myself has slept
in them since he went away last fall to the shanties."

Mrs. Murray felt the delicacy of the position to be sensibly increased.

"Indeed, that is right, Kirsty; one can never tell just what sort of
people are traveling about nowadays."

"Indeed, and it's true," said Kirsty, heartily, "but I never let them in
here. I just keep them to the bunk."

"But," pursued Mrs. Murray, returning to the subject in hand, "it is
very important that for sick people the sheets should be thoroughly
aired and warmed. Why, in the hospital in Montreal they take the very
greatest care to air and change the sheets every day. You see so much
poison comes through the pores of the skin."

"Do you hear that now?" said Kirsty, amazed. "Indeed, I would be often
hearing that those French people are just full of poison and such, and
indeed, it is no wonder, for the food they put inside of them."

"O, no, " said Mrs. Murray, "it is the same with all people, but
especially so with sick people."

Kirsty looked as doubtful as was consistent with her respect for the
minister's wife, and Mrs. Murray went on.

"So you will just get the sheets ready to change, and, Kirsty, a clean
night-shirt."

"Night-shirt! and indeed, he has not such a thing to his name." Kirsty's
tone betrayed her thankfulness that her brother was free from the
effeminacy of a night-shirt; but noting the dismay and confusion on Mrs.
Murray's face, she suggested, hesitatingly, "He might have one of my
own, but I am thinking it will be small for him across the back."

"I am afraid so, Kirsty," said the minister's wife, struggling hard
with a smile. "We will just use one of his own white shirts." But this
scandalized Kirsty as an unnecessary and wasteful luxury.

"Indeed, there is plenty of them in the chist, but he will be keeping
them for the communion season, and the funerals, and such. He will not
be wearing them in his bed, for no one will be seeing him there at all."

"But he will feel so much better," said Mrs. Murray, and her smile was
so sweet and winning that Kirsty's opposition collapsed, and without
more words both sheets and shirt were produced.

As Kirsty laid them out she observed with a sigh: "Aye, aye, she was
the clever woman--the wife, I mean. She was good with the needle, and
indeed, at anything she tried to do."

"I did not know her," said Mrs. Murray, softly, "but every one tells me
she was a good housekeeper and a good woman."

"She was that," said Kirsty, emphatically, "and she was the light of his
eyes, and it was a bad day for Hugh when she went away."

"Now, Kirsty," said Mrs. Murray, after a pause, "before we put on these
clean things, we will just give him a sponge bath."

Kirsty gasped.

"Mercy sakes! He will not be needing that in the winter, and he will be
getting a cold from it. In the summer-time he will be going to the river
himself. And how will you be giving him a bath whatever?"

Mrs. Murray carefully explained the process, again fortifying her
position by referring to the practices of the Montreal hospital, till,
as a result of her persuasions and instructions, in an hour after
Macdonald had awakened from his sleep he was lying in his Sabbath white
shirt and between fresh sheets, and feeling cleaner and more comfortable
than he had for many a day. The fever was much reduced, and he fell
again into a deep sleep.

The two women watched beside him, for neither would leave the other
to watch alone. And Ranald, who could not be persuaded to go up to
his loft, lay on the bunk in the kitchen and dozed. After an hour had
passed, Mrs. Murray inquired as to the nourishment Kirsty had given her
brother.

"Indeed, he will not be taking anything whatever," said Kirsty, in a
vexed tone. "And it is no matter what I will be giving him."

"And what does he like, Kirsty?"

"Indeed, he will be taking anything when he is not seek, and he is that
fond of buckwheat pancakes and pork gravy with maple syrup over them,
but would he look at it! And I made him new porridge to-night, but he
would not touch them."

"Did you try him with gruel, Kirsty?"

"Mercy me, and is it Macdonald Dubh and gruel? He would be flinging the
'feushionless' stuff out of the window."

"But I am sure it would be good for him if he could be persuaded to try
it. I should like to try him."

"Indeed, and you may try. It will be easy enough, for the porridge are
still in the pot."

Kirsty took the pot from the bench, with the remains of the porridge
that had been made for supper still in it, set it on the fire, and
pouring some water in it, began to stir it vigorously. It was thick and
slimy, and altogether a most repulsive-looking mixture, and Mrs. Murray
no longer wondered at Macdonald Dubh's distaste for gruel.

"I think I will make some fresh, if you will let me, Kirsty--in the way
I make it for the minister, you know."

Kirsty, by this time, had completely surrendered to Mrs. Murray's
guidance, and producing the oatmeal, allowed her to have her way; so
that when Macdonald awoke he found Mrs. Murray standing beside him with
a bowl of the nicest gruel and a slice of thin dry toast.

He greeted the minister's wife with grave courtesy, drank the gruel, and
then lay down again to sleep.

"Will you look at that now?" said Kirsty, amazed at Macdonald Dubh's
forbearance. "He would not like to be offending you."

Then Mrs. Murray besought Kirsty to go and lie down for an hour, which
Kirsty very unwillingly agreed to do.

It was not long before Macdonald began to toss and mutter in his sleep,
breaking forth now and then into wild cries and curses. He was fighting
once more his great fight in the Glengarry line, and beating back
LeNoir.

"Back, ye devil! Would ye? Take that, then. Come back, Mack!" Then
followed a cry so wild that Ranald awoke and came into the room.

"Bring in some snow, Ranald," said the minister's wife; "we will lay
some on his head."

She bathed the hot face and hands with ice-cold water, and then laid a
snow compress on the sick man's head, speaking to him in quiet, gentle
tones, till he was soothed again to sleep.

When the gray light of the morning came in through the little window,
Macdonald woke sane and quiet.

"You are better," said Mrs. Murray to him.

"Yes," he said, "I am very well, thank you, except for the pain here."
He pointed to his chest.

"You have been badly hurt, Ranald tells me. How did it happen?"

FATHER HART. Whose child can this be?

MAURTEEN. No one's child at all.
She often dreams that some one has gone by, When there was nothing
but a puff of wind.

MARY.

They have taken away the blessed quicken wood, They will not bring
good luck into the house; Yet I am glad that I was courteous to
them, For are not they, likewise, children of God?

FATHER HART. Colleen, they are the children of the fiend, And they have
power until the end of Time, When God shall fight with them a great
pitched battle And hack them into pieces.

MARY. He will smile, Father, perhaps, and open His great door.

FATHER HART.

Did but the lawless angels see that door They would fall, slain by
everlasting peace; And when such angels knock upon our doors, Who goes
with them must drive through the same storm.

(A thin old arm comes round the door-post and knocks and beckons. It is
clearly seen in the silvery light. MARY BRUIN goes to door and stands
in it for a moment. MAURTEEN BRUIN is busy filling FATHER HART's plate.
BRIDGET BRUIN stirs the fire.)

MARY (coming to table) There's somebody out there that beckoned me
And raised her hand as though it held a cup, And she was drinking
from it, so it may be That she is thirsty.

(She takes milk from the table and carries it to the door.)
FATHER HART. That will be the child That you would have it was no
child at all.

BRIDGET.

And maybe, Father, what he said was true; For there is not another
night in the year So wicked as to-night.

MAURTEEN. Nothing can harm us While the good Father's underneath our
roof.

MARY. A little queer old woman dressed in green.

BRIDGET.

The good people beg for milk and fire Upon May Eve--woe to the house
that gives, For they have power upon it for a year.

MAURTEEN. Hush, woman, hush!

BRIDGET.

She's given milk away.

I knew she would bring evil on the house.

MAURTEEN. Who was it?

MARY. Both the tongue and face were strange.

MAURTEEN.

Some strangers came last week to Clover Hill; She must be one of
them.

BRIDGET. I am afraid.

FATHER HART. The Cross will keep all evil from the house While it hangs
there.

MAURTEEN.

Come, sit beside me, colleen, And put away your dreams of discontent,
For I would have you light up my last days, Like the good glow of
the turf; and when I die You'll be the wealthiest hereabout, for,
colleen, I have a stocking full of yellow guineas Hidden away where
nobody can find it.

BRIDGET. You are the fool of every pretty face, And I must spare and
pinch that my son's wife May have all kinds of ribbons for her
head.

MAURTEEN. Do not be cross; she is a right good girl!

The butter is by your elbow, Father Hart.
My colleen, have not Fate and Time and Change Done well for me and for
old Bridget there?
We have a hundred acres of good land, And sit beside each other
at the fire.
I have this reverend Father for my friend, I look upon your face and
my son's face-- We've put his plate by yours--and here he comes,
And brings with him the only thing we have lacked, Abundance of good
wine.

(SHAWN comes in.)
Stir Up the fire, And put new turf upon it till it blaze; To watch the
turf-smoke coiling from the fire, And feel content and wisdom in
your heart, This is the best of life; when we are young We long to
tread a way none trod before, But find the excellent old way through
love, And through the care of children, to the hour For bidding
Fate and Time and Change goodbye.

(MARY takes a sod of turf from the fire and goes out through the door.
SHAWN follows her and meets her coming in.)
SHAWN. What is it draws you to the chill o' the wood?

There is a light among the stems of the trees That makes one shiver.

MARY. A little queer old man Made me a sign to show he wanted fire
To light his pipe.

BRIDGET. You've given milk and fire Upon the unluckiest night of the
year and brought, For all you know, evil upon the house.

Before you married you were idle and fine And went about with ribbons on
your head; And now--no, Father, I will speak my mind She is not a fitting
wife for any man--
SHAWN. Be quiet, Mother!

MAURTEEN. You are much too cross.

MARY.

What do I care if I have given this house, Where I must hear all
day a bitter tongue, Into the power of faeries 
BRIDGET.

You know well How calling the good people by that name, Or talking of them
over much at all, May bring all kinds of evil on the house.

MARY. Come, faeries, take me out of this dull house!

Let me have all the freedom I have lost; Work when I will and idle
when I will!

Faeries, come take me out of this dull world, For I would ride with you
upon the wind, Run on the top of the dishevelled tide, And dance upon the
mountains like a flame.

FATHER HART. You cannot know the meaning of your words.

MARY. Father, I am right weary of four tongues:
A tongue that is too crafty and too wise, A tongue that is too godly
and too grave, A tongue that is more bitter than the tide, And a
kind tongue too full of drowsy love, Of drowsy love and my
captivity.

(SHAWN BRUIN leads her to a seat at the left of the door.)
SHAWN. Do not blame me; I often lie awake Thinking that all things
trouble your bright head.

How beautiful it is--your broad pale forehead Under a cloudy blossoming
of hair!
Sit down beside me here--these are too old, And have forgotten they were
ever young.

MARY.

O, you are the great door-post of this house, And I the branch of
blessed quicken wood, And if I could I'd hang upon the post, Till
I had brought good luck into the house.

(She would put her arms about him, but looks shyly at the priest and lets
her arms fall.)

FATHER HART. My daughter, take his hand--by love alone God binds
us to Himself and to the hearth, That shuts us from the waste
beyond His peace From maddening freedom and bewildering light.

SHAWN. Would that the world were mine to give it you, And not its quiet
hearths alone, but even All that bewilderment of light and freedom.

If you would have it.

MARY.

I would take the world And break it into pieces in my hands To see you
smile watching it crumble away.

SHAWN. Then I would mould a world of fire and dew With no one bitter,
grave or over wise,
And nothing marred or old to do you wrong, And crowd the enraptured
quiet of the sky With candles burning to your lonely face.

MARY/ Your looks are all the candles that I need.

SHAWN.

Once a fly dancing in a beam of the sun, Or the light wind blowing out
of the dawn, Could fill your heart with dreams none other knew,
But now the indissoluble sacrament Has mixed your heart that was
most proud and cold With my warm heart for ever; the sun and moon
Must fade and heaven be rolled up like a scroll But your white
spirit still walk by my spirit.

(A Voice singing in the wood.)
MAURTEEN.

There's some one singing. Why, it's but a child.
It sang, "The lonely of heart is withered away."

A strange song for a child, but she sings sweetly.
Listen, Listen!

(Goes to door.)

MARY. O, cling close to me, Because I have said wicked things to-night.

THE VOICE.

The wind blows out of the gates of the day, The wind blows over the
lonely of heart, And the lonely of heart is withered away.

While the faeries dance in a place apart, Shaking their milk-white feet
in a ring, Tossing their milk-white arms in the air For they hear
the wind laugh and murmur and sing Of a land where even the old are
fair, And even the wise are merry of tongue But I heard a reed of
Coolaney say, When the wind has laughed and murmured and sung The
lonely of heart is withered away 
MAURTEEN.

Being happy, I would have all others happy, So I will bring her in out
of the cold.

(He brings in the faery child.)
THE CHILD. I tire of winds and waters and pale lights.

MAURTEEN. And that's no wonder, for when night has fallen The wood's a
cold and a bewildering place, But you are welcome here.

THE CHILD. I am welcome here.
For when I tire of this warm little house There is one here that must away,
away.

MAURTEEN. O, listen to her dreamy and strange talk.
Are you not cold?

THE CHILD. I will crouch down beside you, For I have run a long, long
way this night.

BRIDGET.

You have a comely shape.

MAURTEEN. Your hair is wet.

BRIDGET. I'll warm your chilly feet.

MAURTEEN. You have come indeed A long, long way--for I have never seen
Your pretty face--and must be tired and hungry, Here is some bread and
wine.

THE CHILD. The wine is bitter.
Old mother, have you no sweet food for me?

BRIDGET. I have some honey.

(She goes into the next room.)
MAURTEEN. You have coaxing ways, The mother was quite cross before you
came.

(BRIDGET returns with the honey and fills Porringer with milk.)
BRIDGET. She is the child of gentle people; look At her white hands and
at her pretty dress.
I've brought you some new milk, but wait a while And I will put it to the
fire to warm, For things well fitted for poor folk like us Would never
please a high-born child like you.

THE CHILD. From dawn, when you must blow the fire ablaze, You work
your fingers to the bone, old mother.
The young may lie in bed and dream and hope, But you must work your
fingers to the bone Because your heart is old.

BRIDGET. The young are idle.

THE CHILD.

Your memories have made you wise, old father; The young must sigh through
many a dream and hope, But you are wise because your heart is old.

(BRIDGET gives her more bread and honey.)
MAURTEEN. O, who would think to find so young a girl Loving old age
and wisdom?

THE CHILD. No more, mother.

MAURTEEN. What a small bite! The milk is ready now.

(Hands it to her.)
What a small sip!

THE CHILD. Put on my shoes, old mother.
Now I would like to dance now I have eaten, The reeds are dancing by
Coolaney lake, And I would like to dance until the reeds And the
white waves have danced themselves asleep.

(BRIDGET puts on the shoes, and the CHILD is about to dance, but
suddenly sees the crucifix and shrieks and covers her eyes.)

What is that ugly thing on the black cross?

FATHER HART. You cannot know how naughty your words are!
That is our Blessed Lord.

THE CHILD. Hide it away,
BRIDGET. I have begun to be afraid again.

THE CHILD. Hide it away!

MAURTEEN. That would be wickedness!

BRIDGET. That would be sacrilege!

THE CHILD. The tortured thing Hide it away!

MAURTEEN. Her parents are to blame.

FATHER HART. That is the image of the Son of God.

THE CHILD (caressing him) Hide it away, hide it away!

MAURTEEN. No, no.

FATHER HART.

Because you are so young and like a bird, That must take fright at every
stir of the leaves, I will go take it down.

THE CHILD. Hide it away!
And cover it out of sight and out of mind!

(FATHER HART takes crucifix from wall and carries it towards inner room.)

FATHER HART. Since you have come into this barony, I will instruct you
in our blessed faith And being so keen witted you'll soon learn.

(To the others.)
We must be tender to all budding things, Our Maker let no thought of
Calvary Trouble the morning stars in their first song.

(Puts crucifix in inner room.)

THE CHILD. Here is level ground for dancing; I will dance.

(Sings.)
"The wind blows out of the gates of the day, The wind blows over the
lonely of heart, And the lonely of heart is withered away."
(She dances.)

MARY (to SHAWN). just now when she came near I thought I heard Other
small steps beating upon the floor, And a faint music blowing in
the wind, Invisible pipes giving her feet the tune.

SHAWN. I heard no steps but hers.

MARY.

I hear them now, The unholy powers are dancing in the house.

MAURTEEN. Come over here, and if you promise me Not to talk wickedly
of holy things I will give you something.

THE CHILD. Bring it me, old father.

MAURTEEN. Here are some ribbons that I bought in the town For my son's
wife--but she will let me give them To tie up that wild hair the
winds have tumbled.

THE CHILD. Come, tell me, do you love me?

MAURTEEN. Yes, I love you.

THE CHILD. Ah, but you love this fireside.

Do you love me?

FATHER HART. When the Almighty puts so great a share Of His own ageless
youth into a creature, To look is but to love.

THE CHILD. But you love Him?

BRIDGET.

She is blaspheming.

THE CHILD. And do you love me too
MARY. I do not know.

THE CHILD. You love that young man there, Yet I could make you ride upon
the winds, Run on the top of the dishevelled tide, And dance upon
the mountains like a flame.
MARY. Queen of Angels and kind saints defend us!
Some dreadful thing will happen. A while ago She took away the
blessed quicken wood.
FATHER HART. You fear because of her unmeasured prattle; She knows
no better. Child, how old are you?
THE CHILD. When winter sleep is abroad my hair grows thin, My feet
unsteady. When the leaves awaken My mother carries me in her golden
arms; I'll soon put on my womanhood and marry The spirits of wood
and water, but who can tell When I was born for the first time? I
think I am much older than the eagle cock That blinks and blinks
on Ballygawley Hill, And he is the oldest thing under the moon.
FATHER HART. O she is of the faery people.
THE CHILD. One called, I sent my messengers for milk and fire, She
called again and after that I came.
(All except SHAWN and MARY BRUIN gather behind the priest for
protection.)
SHAWN (rising) Though you have made all these obedient, You have
not charmed my sight and won from me A wish or gift to make you
powerful; I'll turn you from the house.
FATHER HART. No, I will face her.
THE CHILD. Because you took away the crucifix I am so mighty that
there's none can pass, Unless I will it, where my feet have danced
Or where I've whirled my finger-tops.
(SHAWN tries to approach her and cannot.) 
MAURTEEN. Look, look!

FATHER HART. I will confront this mighty spirit alone.
Be not afraid, the Father is with us, The Holy Martyrs and the
Innocents, The adoring Magi in their coats of mail, And He who died

THE CHILD. You shall go with me, newly-married bride,
And gaze upon a merrier multitude.
White-armed Nuala, Aengus of the Birds, Feacra of the hurtling foam,
and him Who is the ruler of the Western Host, Finvarra, and their
Land of Heart's Desire, Where beauty has no ebb, decay no flood,
But joy is wisdom, Time an endless song.
I kiss you and the world begins to fade.
SHAWN. Awake out of that trance--and cover up Your eyes and
ears.
FATHER HART. She must both look and listen, For only the soul's
choice can save her now.
Come over to me, daughter; stand beside me; Think of this house and
of your duties in it.
THE CHILD. Stay and come with me, newly-married bride, For if you
hear him you grow like the rest; Bear children, cook, and bend above
the churn, And wrangle over butter, fowl, and eggs, Until at last,
grown old and bitter of tongue, You're crouching there and shivering
at the grave.
FATHER HART. Daughter, I point you out the way to Heaven.
THE CHILD. But I can lead you, newly-married bride, Where nobody
gets old and crafty and wise, Where nobody gets old and godly and
grave, Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue, And where kind
tongues bring no captivity; For we are but obedient to the thoughts
That drift into the mind at a wink of the eye.
FATHER HART. . By the dear Name of the One crucified, I bid you,
Mary Bruin, come to me.
THE CHILD. I keep you in the name of your own heart.
FATHER HART. It is because I put away the crucifix That I am nothing,
and my power is nothing, I'll bring it here again.
MAURTEEN (clinging to him) No!

BRIDGET. Do not leave us.
FATHER HART. O, let me go before it is too late; It is my sin alone
that brought it all.

THE CHILD. I hear them sing, "Come, newly-married bride, Come, to
the woods and waters and pale lights."
MARY. I will go with you.

FATHER HART. She is lost, alas!
THE CHILD (standing by the door) But clinging mortal hope must fall
from you, For we who ride the winds, run on the waves, And dance
upon the mountains are more light Than dewdrops on the banner of
the dawn.

MARY. O, take me with you.
SHAWN. Beloved, I will keep you.
I've more than words, I have these arms to hold you, Nor all the
faery host, do what they please, Shall ever make me loosen you from
these arms.

MARY. Dear face! Dear voice!
THE CHILD. Come, newly-married bride.
MARY. I always loved her world--and yet--and yet--
THE CHILD. White bird, white bird, come with me, little bird.
MARY. She calls me!

THE CHILD. Come with me, little bird.

MARY. I can hear songs and dancing.

SHAWN. Stay with me.

with the jumper," said Ranald, pointing to the stout, home-made sleigh
used for gathering the sap and the wood for the fire.

"Oh, I see you have begun tapping," said Mrs. Murray; "and do you do it
yourself?"

"Why, yes, mother; don't you see all those trees?" cried Hughie,
pointing to a number of maples that stood behind the shanty. "Ranald and
Don did all those, and made the spiles, too. See!" He caught up a spile
from a heap lying near the door. "Ranald made all these."

"Why, that's fine, Ranald. How do you make them? I have never seen one
made."

"Oh, mother!" Hughie's voice was full of pity for her ignorance. He had
seen his first that afternoon.

"And I have never seen the tapping of a tree. I believe I shall learn
just now, if Ranald will only show me, from the very beginning."

Her eager interest in his work won Ranald from his reserve. "There is
not much to see," he said, apologetically. "You just cut a natch in the
tree, and drive in the spile, and--"

"Oh, but wait," she cried. "That's just what I wanted to see. How do you
make the spile?"

"Oh, that is easy," said Ranald. He took up a slightly concave chisel or
gouge, and slit a slim slab from off a block of cedar about a foot long.

"This is a spile," he exclaimed. "We drive it into the tree, and the sap
runs down into the trough, you see."

"No, I don't see," said the minister's wife. She was too thoroughgoing
to do things by halves. "How do you drive this into the tree, and how do
you get the sap to run down it?"

"I will show you," he said, and taking with him a gouge and ax, he
approached a maple still untapped. "You first make a gash like this." So
saying, with two or three blows of his ax, he made a slanting notch in
the tree. "And then you make a place for the spile this way." With the
back of his ax he drove his gouge into the corner of the notch, and then
fitted his spile into the incision so made.

"Ah, now I see. And you put the trough under the drip from the spile.
But how do you make the troughs?"

"I did not make them," said Ranald. "Some of them father made, and some
of them belong to the Camerons. But it is easy enough. You just take a
thick slab of basswood and hollow it out with the adze."

Mrs. Murray was greatly pleased. "I'm very much obliged to you, Ranald,"
she said, "and I am glad I came down to see your camp. Now, if you will
ask me, I should like to see you make the sugar." Had her request been
made before the night of their famous ride, Ranald would have found
some polite reason for refusal, but now he was rather surprised to find
himself urging her to come to a sugaring-off at the close of the season.

"I shall be delighted to come," cried Mrs. Murray, "and it is very good
of you to ask me, and I shall bring my niece, who is coming with Mr.
Murray from town to spend some weeks with me."

Ranald's face fell, but his Highland courtesy forbade retreat. "If she
would care," he said, doubtfully.

"Oh, I am sure she would be very glad! She has never been outside of the
city, and I want her to learn all she can of the country and the woods.
It is positively painful to see the ignorance of these city children in
regard to all living things--beasts and birds and plants. Why, many of
them couldn't tell a beech from a basswood."

"Oh, mother!" protested Hughie, aghast at such ignorance.

"Yes, indeed, it is dreadful, I assure you," said his mother, smiling.
"Why, I know a grown-up woman who didn't know till after she was married
the difference between a spruce and a pine."

"But you know them all now," said Hughie, a little anxious for his
mother's reputation.

"Yes, indeed," said his mother, proudly; "every one, I think, at least
when the leaves are out. So I want Maimie to learn all she can."

Ranald did not like the idea any too well, but after they had gone
his thoughts kept turning to the proposed visit of Mrs. Murray and her
niece.

"Maimie," said Ranald to himself. "So that is her name." It had
a musical sound, and was different from the names of the girls he
knew--Betsy and Kirsty and Jessie and Marget and Jinny. It was finer
somehow than these, and seemed to suit better a city girl. He wondered
if she would be nice, but he decided that doubtless she would be
"proud." To be "proud" was the unpardonable sin with the Glengarry
boy. The boy or girl convicted of this crime earned the contempt of all
self-respecting people. On the whole, Ranald was sorry she was coming.
Even in school he was shy with the girls, and kept away from them. They
were always giggling and blushing and making one feel queer, and they
never meant what they said. He had no doubt Maimie would be like the
rest, and perhaps a little worse. Of course, being Mrs. Murray's niece,
she might be something like her. Still, that could hardly be. No girl
could ever be like the minister's wife. He resolved he would turn Maimie
over to Don. He remembered, with great relief, that Don did not mind
girls; indeed, he suspected Don rather enjoyed playing the "forfeit"
games at school with them, in which the penalties were paid in kisses.
How often had he shuddered and admired from a distance, while Don and
the others played those daring games! Yes, Don would do the honors for
Maimie. Perhaps Don would even venture to play "forfeits" with her.
Ranald felt his face grow hot at this thought. Then, with sudden
self-detection, he cried, angrily, aloud: "I don't care; let him; he may
for all I care."

"Who may what?" cried a voice behind him. It was Don himself.

"Nothing," said Ranald, blushing shamefacedly.

"Why, what are you mad about?" asked Don, noticing his flushed face.

"Who is mad?" said Ranald. "I am not mad whatever."

"Well, you look mighty like it," said Don. "You look mad enough to
fight."

But Ranald, ignoring him, simply said, "We will need to be gathering the
sap this evening, for the troughs will be full."

"Huh-huh," said Don. "I guess we can carry all there is to-day, but we
will have to get the colt to-morrow. Got the spiles ready?"

"Enough for to-day," said Ranald, wondering how he could tell Don of
the proposed visit of Mrs. Murray and her niece. Taking each a bundle of
spiles and an ax, the boys set out for the part of the sugar bush as yet
untapped, and began their work.

"The minister's wife and Hughie were here just now," began Ranald.

"Huh-huh, I met them down the road. Hughie said he was coming day after
to-morrow."

"Did Mrs. Murray tell you--"

"Tell me what?"

"Did she tell you she would like to see a sugaring-off?"

"No; they didn't stop long enough to tell me anything. Hughie shouted at
me as they passed."

"Well," said Ranald, speaking slowly and with difficulty, "she wanted
bad to see the sugar-making, and I asked her to come."

"You did, eh? I wonder at you."

"And she wanted to bring her niece, and--and--I let her," said Ranald.

"Her niece! Jee-roo-sa-LEM!" cried Don. "Do you know who her niece is?"

"Not I," said Ranald, looking rather alarmed.

"Well, she is the daughter of the big lumberman, St. Clair, and she is a
great swell."

Ranald stood speechless.

"That does beat all," pursued Don; "and you asked her to our camp?"

Then Ranald grew angry. "And why not?" he said, defiantly. "What is
wrong about that?"

"O, nothing much," laughed Don, "if I had done it, but for you, Ranald!
Why, what will you do with that swell young lady from the city?"

"I will just do nothing," said Ranald. "There will be you and Mrs.
Murray, and--"

"Oh, I say," burst in Don, "that's bully! Let's ask some of the boys,
and--your aunt, and--my mother, and--some of the girls."

"Oh, shucks!" said Ranald, angrily. "You just want Marget Aird."

"You get out!" cried Don, indignantly; "Marget Aird!" Then, after a
pause, he added, "All right, I don't want anybody else. I'll look after
Mrs. Murray, and you and Maimie can do what you like."

This combination sounded so terrible to Ranald that he surrendered at
once; and it was arranged that there should be a grand sugaring-off, and
that others besides the minister's wife and her niece should be invited.

But Mrs. Murray had noticed the falling of Ranald's face at the mention
of Maimie's visit to the camp, and feeling that she had taken him at
a disadvantage, she determined that she would the very next day put
herself right with him. She was eager to follow up the advantage she had
gained the day before in establishing terms of friendship with Ranald,
for her heart went out to the boy, in whose deep, passionate nature she
saw vast possibilities for good or ill. On her return from her daily
visit to Macdonald Dubh, she took the camp road, and had the good
fortune to find Ranald alone, "rigging up" his kettles preparatory
to the boiling. But she had no time for kettles to-day, and she went
straight to her business.

"I came to see you, Ranald," she said, after she had shaken hands with
him, "about our sugaring-off. I've been thinking that it would perhaps
be better to have no strangers, but just old friends, you and Don and
Hughie and me."

Ranald at once caught her meaning, but found himself strangely unwilling
to be extricated from his predicament.

"I mean," said Mrs. Murray, frankly, "we might enjoy it better without
my niece; and so, perhaps, we could have the sugaring when I come to
bring Hughie home on Friday. Maimie does not come till Saturday."

Her frankness disarmed Ranald of his reserve. "I know well what you
mean," he said, without his usual awkwardness, "but I do not mind now
at all having your niece come; and Don is going to have a party." The
quiet, grave tone was that of a man, and Mrs. Murray looked at the boy
with new eyes. She did not know that it was her own frank confidence
that had won like confidence from him.

"How old are you, Ranald?" she said, in her wonder.

"I will be going on eighteen."

"You will soon be a man, Ranald." Ranald remained silent, and she went
on earnestly: "A strong, good, brave man, Ranald."

The blood rushed to the boy's face with a sudden flood, but still he
stood silent.

"I'm going to give you Hughie for two days," she continued, in the same
earnest voice; and leaning down over her pony's neck toward him: "I want
him to know strong and manly boys. He is very fond of you, Ranald. He
thinks you are better than any man in the world." She paused, her lips
parting in a smile that made Ranald's heart beat quick. Then she went on
with a shy hesitancy: "Ranald, I know the boys sometimes drop words they
should not and tell stories unfit to hear"; the blood was beginning
to show in her cheek; "and I would not like my little boy--" Her voice
broke suddenly, but recovering quickly she went on in grave, sweet
tones: "I trust him to you, Ranald, for this time and afterward. He
looks up to you. I want him to be a good, brave man, and to keep his
heart pure." Ranald could not speak, but he looked steadily into Mrs.
Murray's eyes as he took the hand she offered, and she knew he was
pledging himself to her.

"You'll come for him to-morrow," she said, as she turned away. By this
time Ranald had found his voice.

"Yes, ma'am," he replied. "And I will take good care of him."

Once more Mrs. Murray found herself looking at Ranald as if seeing him
for the first time. He had the solemn voice and manner of a man making
oath of allegiance, and she rode away with her heart at rest concerning
her little boy. With Ranald, at least, he would be safe.

            *         *         *         *         *

Those two days had been for Hughie long and weary, but at last the great
day came for him, as all great days will come for those who can wait.
Ranald appeared at the manse before the breakfast was well begun, and
Hughie, with the unconscious egoism of childhood, was for rushing off
without thought of preparation for himself or of farewell for those left
behind. Indeed, he was for leaving his porridge untasted, declaring he
"wasn't a bit hungry," but his mother brought him to his senses.

"No breakfast, no sugar bush to-day, Hughie," she said; "we cannot send
men out to the woods that cannot eat breakfast, can we, Ranald?"

Hughie at once fell upon his porridge with vigor, while Ranald, who was
much too shy to eat at the minister's table, sat and waited.

After breakfast was over, Jessie was called in for the morning worship,
without which no day was ever begun in the manse. At worship in the
minister's house every one present took part. It was Hughie's special
joy to lead the singing of the psalm. His voice rose high and clear,
even above his mother's, for he loved to sing, and Ranald's presence
inspired him to do his best. Ranald had often heard the psalm sung in
the church--


      I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
      From whence doth come mine aid;


and the tune was the old, familiar "French," but somehow it was all new
to him that day. The fresh voices and the crisp, prompt movement of the
tune made Ranald feel as if he had never heard the psalm sung before. In
the reading he took his verse with the others, stumbling a little, not
because the words were too big for him, but because they seemed to run
into one another. The chapter for the day contained Paul's injunction to
Timothy, urging him to fidelity and courage as a good soldier of Jesus
Christ.

When the reading was done, Mrs. Murray told them a story of a young man
who had shed his blood upon a Scottish moor because he was too brave to
be untrue to his lord, and then, in a few words, made them all see
that still some conflict was being waged, and that there was still
opportunity for each to display loyal courage and fidelity.

In the prayer that followed, the first thing that surprised Ranald was
the absence of the set forms and tones of prayer, with which he was
familiar. It was all so simple and real. The mother was telling the
great Father in heaven her cares and anxieties, and the day's needs
for them all, sure that he would understand and answer. Every one was
remembered--the absent head of the family and those present; the young
man worshiping with them, that he might be a true man and a good soldier
of Jesus Christ; and at the close, the little lad going away this
morning, that he might be kept from all harm and from all evil thoughts
and deeds. The simple beauty of the words, the music in the voice, and
the tender, trustful feeling that breathed through the prayer awakened
in Ranald's heart emotions and longings he had never known before, and
he rose from his knees feeling how wicked and how cruel a thing it would
be to cause one of these little ones to stumble.

After the worship was over, Hughie seized his Scotch bonnet and rushed
for the jumper, and in a few minutes his mother had all the space not
taken up by him and Ranald packed with blankets and baskets.

"Jessie thinks that even great shanty-men like you and Don and Hughie
will not object to something better than bread and pork."

"Indeed, we will not," said Ranald, heartily.

Then Hughie suddenly remembered that he was actually leaving home, and
climbing out of the jumper, he rushed at his mother.

"Oh, mother, good by!" he cried.

His mother stooped and put her arms about him. "Good by, my darling,"
she said, in a low voice; "I trust you to be a good boy, and, Hughie,
don't forget your prayers."

divergence in the opinion of explorers as to the temperature of
Tierra del Fuego.

Weddell attributes this to the different south the thermometer was
never more than the new continent, so that the honour of being the
first to discover it is undoubtedly his.

damages or because of the dangers from the roughness of the sea

This continent, stretching away for 250 miles really little known until

name of Biscoe was given to the islets in honour of their discoverer.

snow, in every respect similar to that found by in things the Arctic
regions.

Of far greater interest, however, was the survey of the health of
the crew, compelled Biscoe to make for Van Diemen's Land, where he was
not rejoined by the_Lively_ until some months later. The explorers had
several opportunities of the aurora australis, to quote from Biscoe's
narrative, or rather the account of his trip drawn up from his log-book,
and published in the journal of the Royal Geographical Society."

Three powers simultaneously resolved to send out an expedition. France

Murray and her niece. The
Airds had not yet come, but all the rest were there. The Finlaysons and
the McKerachers, Dan Campbell's boys, and their sister Betsy, whom every
one called "Betsy Dan," redheaded, freckled, and irrepressible; the
McGregors, and a dozen or more of the wildest youngsters that could be
found in all the Indian Lands. Depositing their baskets in the shanty,
for they had no thought of fasting, they crowded about the fire.

"Attention!" cried Don, who had a "gift of the gab," as his mother
said. "Ladies and gentlemen, the program for this evening is as follows:
games, tea, and taffy, in the order mentioned. In the first, all MUST
take part; in the second, all MAY take part; but in the third, none NEED
take part."

After the laughter and the chorus of "Ohs" had subsided, Don proceeded:
"The captains for the evening are, Elizabeth Campbell, better known
as 'Betsy Dan,' and John Finlayson, familiar to us all as 'Johnnie the
Widow,' two young people of excellent character, and I believe, slightly
known to each other."

Again a shout went up from the company, but Betsy Dan, who cared not at
all for Don's banter, contented herself with pushing out her lower lip
at him with scorn, in that indescribable manner natural to girls, but to
boys impossible.

Then the choosing began. Betsy Dan, claiming first choice by virtue of
her sex, immediately called out, "Ranald Macdonald."

But Ranald shook his head. "I cannot leave the fire," he said, blushing;
"take Don there."

But Betsy demurred. "I don't want Don," she cried. "Come on, Ranald; the
fire will do quite well." Betsy, as indeed did most of the school-girls,
adored Ranald in her secret heart, though she scorned to show it.

But Ranald still refused, till Don said, "It is too bad, Betsy, but
you'll have to take me."

"Oh, come on, then!" laughed Betsy; "you will be better than nobody."

Then it was Johnnie the Widow's choice: "Maimie St. Clair."

Maimie hesitated and looked at her aunt, who said, "Yes, go, my dear, if
you would like."

"Marget Aird!" cried Betsy, spying Marget and her brothers coming down
the road. "Come along, Marget; you are on my side--on Don's side, I
mean." At which poor Marget, a tall, fair girl, with sweet face and shy
manner, blushed furiously, but, after greeting the minister's wife and
the rest of the older people, she took her place beside Don.

The choosing went on till every one present was taken, not even Aunt
Kirsty being allowed to remain neutral in the coming games. For an hour
the sports went on. Racing, jumping, bear, London bridge, crack the
whip, and lastly, forfeits.

Meantime Ranald superintended the sap-boiling, keeping on the opposite
side of the fire from the ladies, and answering in monosyllables any
questions addressed to him. But when it was time to make the tea, Mrs.
Cameron and Kirsty insisted on taking charge of this, and Mrs. Murray,
coming round to Ranald, said: "Now, Ranald, I came to learn all about
sugar-making, and while the others are making tea, I want you to teach
me how to make sugar."

Ranald gladly agreed to show her all he knew. He had been feeling
awkward and miserable in the noisy crowd, but especially in the presence
of Maimie. He had not forgotten the smile of amusement with which
she had greeted him at the manse, and his wounded pride longed for an
opportunity to pour upon her the vials of his contempt. But somehow,
in her presence, contempt would not arise within him, and he was driven
into wretched silence and self-abasement. It was, therefore, with
peculiar gratitude that he turned to Mrs. Murray as to one who both
understood and trusted him.

"I thank you for the books, Mrs. Murray," he began, in a low, hurried
voice. "They are just wonderful. That Rob Roy and Ivanhoe, oh! they are
the grand books." His face was fairly blazing with enthusiasm. "I never
knew there were such books at all."

"I am very glad you like them, Ranald," said Mrs. Murray, in tones of
warm sympathy, "and I shall give you as many as you like."

"I cannot thank you enough. I have not the words," said the boy, looking
as if he might fall down at her feet. Mrs. Murray was greatly touched
both by his enthusiasm and his gratitude.

"It is a great pleasure to me, Ranald, that you like them," she said,
earnestly. "I want you to love good books and good men and noble deeds."

Ranald stood listening in silence.

"Then some day you will be a good and great man yourself," she added,
"and you will do some noble work."

The boy stood looking far away into the woods, his black eyes filled
with a mysterious fire. Suddenly he threw back his head and said, as
if he had forgotten Mrs. Murray's presence, "Yes, some day I will be a
great man. I know it well."

"And good," softly added Mrs. Murray.

He turned and looked at her a moment as if in a dream. Then, recalling
himself, he answered, "I suppose that is the best."

"Yes, it is the best, Ranald," she replied. "No man is great who is not
good. But come now and give me my lesson."

Ranald stepped out into the bush, and from a tree near by he lifted a
trough of sap and emptied it into the big kettle.

"That's the first thing you do with the sap," he said.

"How? Carry every trough to the kettle?"

"Oh, I see," laughed Ranald. "You must have every step."

"Yes, indeed," she replied, with determination.

"Well, here it is."

He seized a bucket, went to another tree, emptied the sap from the
trough into the bucket, and thence into the barrel, and from the barrel
into the big kettle.

"Then from the big kettle into the little one," he said, catching up a
big dipper tied to a long pole, and transferring the boiling sap as he
spoke from one kettle to another.

"But how can you tell when it is ready?" asked Mrs. Murray.

"Only by tasting. When it is very sweet it must go into the little
kettle."

"And then?"

Her eager determination to know all the details delighted him beyond
measure.

"Then you must be very careful indeed, or you will lose all your day's
work, and your sugar besides, for it is very easy to burn."

"But how can you tell when it is ready?"

"Oh, you must just keep tasting every few minutes till you think you
have the syrup, and then for the sugar you must just boil it a little
longer."

"Well," said Mrs. Murray, "when it is ready what do you do?"

"Then," he said, "you must quickly knock the fire from under it, and
pour it into the pans, stirring it till it gets nearly cool."

"And why do you stir it?" she asked.

"Oh, to keep it from getting too hard."

"Now I have learned something I never knew before," said the minister's
wife, delightedly, "and I am very grateful to you. We must help each
other, Ranald."

"Indeed, it is little I can do for you," he said, shyly.

"You do not know how much I am going to ask you to do," she said,
lightly. "Wait and see."

At that moment a series of shrieks rose high above the shouting and
laughter of the games, and Maimie came flying down toward the camp,
pursued by Don, with the others following.

"Oh, auntie!" she panted, "he's going to--going to--" she paused, with
cheeks burning.

"It's forfeits, Mrs. Murray," explained Don.

"Hoot, lassie," said Mrs. Cameron; "it will not much hurt you, anyway.
They that kiss in the light will not kiss in the dark."

"She played, and lost her forfeit," said Don, unwilling to be jeered at
by the others for faint-heartedness. "She ought to pay."

"I'm afraid, Don, she does not understand our ways," said Mrs. Murray,
apologetically.

"Be off, Don," said his mother. "Kiss Marget there, if you can--it will
not hurt her--and leave the young lady alone."

"It's just horrid of them, auntie," said Maimie, indignantly, as the
others went back to their games.

"Indeed," said Mrs. Cameron, warmly, "if you will never do worse than
kiss a laddie in a game, it's little harm will be coming to you."

But Maimie ignored her.

"Is it not horrid, auntie?" she said.

"Well, my dear, if you think so, it is. But not for these girls, who
play the game with never a thought of impropriety and with no shock to
their modesty. Much depends on how you think about these things."

But Maimie was not satisfied. She was indignant at Don for offering
to kiss her, but as she stood and watched the games going on under the
trees--the tag, the chase, the catch, and the kiss--she somehow began to
feel as if it were not so terrible after all, and to think that perhaps
these girls might play the game and still be nice enough. But she had
no thought of going back to them, and so she turned her attention to
the preparations for tea, now almost complete. Her aunt and Ranald were
toasting slices of bread at the big blazing fire, on forks made out of
long switches.

"Let me try, auntie," she said, pushing up to the fire between her aunt
and Ranald. "I am sure I can do that."

"Be careful of that fire," said Ranald, sharply, pulling back her skirt,
that had blown dangerously near the blaze. "Stand back further," he
commanded.

Mamie looked at him, surprise, indignation, and fear struggling for the
mastery. Was this the awkward boy that had blushed and stammered before
her a week ago?

"It's very dangerous," he explained to Mrs. Murray, "the wind blows out
the flames."

As he spoke he handed Maimie his toasting stick and retired to the other
side of the fire, and began to attend to the boiling sap.

"He needn't be such a bear," pouted Maimie.

"My dear," replied her aunt, "what Ranald says is quite true. You cannot
be too careful in moving about the fire."

"Well, he needn't be so cross about it," said Maimie. She had never been
ordered about before in her life, and she did not enjoy the experience,
and all the more at the hands of an uncouth country boy. She watched
Ranald attending to the fire and the kettles, however, with a new
respect. He certainly had no fear of the fire, but moved about it and
handled it with the utmost sang-froid. He had a certain grace, too, in
his movements that caught her eye, and she wished he would come nearer
so that she could speak to him. She had considerable confidence in her
powers of attraction. As if to answer her wish, Ranald came straight to
where her aunt and she were standing.

"I think it will be time for tea now," he said, with a sudden return of
his awkward manner, that made Maimie wonder why she had ever been afraid
of him. "I will tell Don," he added, striding off toward the group of
boys and girls, still busy with their games under the trees.

Soon Don's shout was heard: "Tea, ladies and gentlemen; take your seats
at the tables." And speedily there was a rush and scramble, and in a few
moments the great heaps of green balsam boughs arranged around the fire
were full of boys and girls pulling, pinching, and tumbling over one
another in wild glee.

The toast stood in brown heaps on birch-bark plates beside the fire, and
baskets were carried out of the shanty bulging with cakes; the tea
was bubbling in the big tin tea-pail, and everything was ready for the
feast. But Ranald had caught Mrs. Murray's eye, and at a sign from her,
stood waiting with the tea-pail in his hand.

"Come on with the tea, Ranald," cried Don, seizing a plate of toast.

"Wait a minute, Don," said Ranald, in a low tone.

"What's the matter?"

But Ranald stood still, looking silently at the minister's wife. Then,
as all eyes turned toward her, she said, in a gentle, sweet voice,
"I think we ought to give thanks to our Father in heaven for all this
beauty about us and for all our joy."

At once Ranald took off his hat, and as the boys followed his example,
Mrs. Murray bowed her head and in a few, simple words lifted up the
hearts of all with her own in thanksgiving for the beauty of the woods
and sky above them, and all the many gifts that came to fill their lives
with joy.

It was not the first time that Ranald had heard her voice in prayer, but
somehow it sounded different in the open air under the trees and in the
midst of all the jollity of the sugaring-off. With all other people
that Ranald knew religion seemed to be something apart from common days,
common people, and common things, and seemed, besides, a solemn and
terrible experience; but with the minister's wife, religion was a part
of her every-day living, and seemed to be as easily associated with her
pleasure as with anything else about her. It was so easy, so simple, so
natural, that Ranald could not help wondering if, after all, it was the
right kind. It was so unlike the religion of the elders and all the good
people in the congregation. It was a great puzzle to Ranald, as to many
others, both before and since his time.

After tea was over the great business of the evening came on. Ranald
announced that the taffy was ready, and Don, as master of ceremonies,
immediately cried out: "The gentlemen will provide the ladies with
plates."

"Plates!" echoed the boys, with a laugh of derision.

"Plates," repeated Don, stepping back to a great snowbank, near a balsam
clump, and returning with a piece of "crust." At once there was a scurry
to the snowbank, and soon every one had a snow plate ready. Then Ranald
and Don slid the little kettle along the pole off the fire, and with
tin dippers began to pour the hot syrup upon the snow plates, where it
immediately hardened into taffy. Then the pulling began. What fun there
was, what larks, what shrieks, what romping and tumbling, till all were
heartily tired, both of the taffy and the fun.

Then followed the sugar-molding. The little kettle was set back on the
fire and kept carefully stirred, while tin dishes of all sorts, shapes,
and sizes--milk-pans, pattie-pans, mugs, and cups--well greased with
pork rind, were set out in order, imbedded in snow.

The last act of all was the making of "hens' nests." A dozen or so of
hens' eggs, blown empty, and three goose eggs for the grown-ups, were
set in snow nests, and carefully filled from the little kettle. In a few
minutes the nests were filled with sugar eggs, and the sugaring-off was
over.

There remained still a goose egg provided against any mishap.

"Who wants the goose egg?" cried Don, holding it up.

"Me!" "me!" "me!" coaxed the girls on every side.

"Will you give it to me, Don, for the minister?" said Mrs. Murray.

"Oh, yes!" cried Maimie, "and let me fill it."

As she spoke, she seized the dipper, and ran for the kettle.

"Look out for that fire," cried Don, dropping the egg into its snowbed.
He was too late. A little tongue of flame leaped out from under the
kettle, nipped hold of her frock, and in a moment she was in a blaze.
With a wild scream she sprang back and turned to fly, but before she had
gone more than a single step Ranald, dashing the crowd right and left,
had seized and flung her headlong into the snow, beating out the flames
with his bare hands. In a moment all danger was over, and Ranald lifted
her up. Still screaming, she clung to him, while the women all ran to
her. Her aunt reached her first.

"Hush, Maimie; hush, dear. You are quite safe now. Let me see your face.
There now, be quiet, child. The danger is all over."

Still Maimie kept screaming. She was thoroughly terrified.

"Listen to me," her aunt said, in an even, firm voice. "Do not be
foolish. Let me look at you."

The quiet, firm voice soothed her, and Maimie's screams ceased. Her aunt
examined her face, neck, and arms for any signs of fire, but could find
none. She was hardly touched, so swift had been her rescue. Then Mrs.
Murray, suddenly putting her arms round about her niece, and holding her
tight, cried: "Thank God, my darling, for his great kindness to you and
to us all. Thank God! thank God!"

Her voice broke, but in a moment, recovering herself, she went on, "And
Ranald, too! noble fellow!"

Ranald was standing at the back of the crowd, looking pale, disturbed,
and awkward. Mrs. Murray, knowing how hateful to him would be any
demonstrations of feeling, went to him, and quietly held out her hand,
saying: "It was bravely done, Ranald. From my heart, I thank you."

For a moment or two she looked steadily into his face with tears
streaming down her cheeks. Then putting her hands upon his shoulders,
she said, softly:

"For her dear, dead mother's sake, I thank you."

Then Maimie, who had been standing in a kind of stupor all this while,
seemed suddenly to awake, and running swiftly toward Ranald, she put out
both hands, crying: "Oh, Ranald, I can never thank you enough!"

He took her hands in an agony of embarrassment, not knowing what to do
or say. Then Maimie suddenly dropped his hands, and throwing her arms
about his neck, kissed him, and ran back to her aunt's side.

"I thought you didn't play forfeits, Maimie," said Don, in a grieved
voice. And every one was glad to laugh.

Then the minister's wife, looking round upon them all, said: "Dear
children, God has been very good to us, and I think we ought to give him
thanks."

And standing there by the fire, they bowed their heads in a new
thanksgiving to Him whose keeping never fails by day or night. And then,
with hearts and voices subdued, and with quiet good nights, they went
their ways home.

But as the Cameron sleigh drove off with its load, Maimie looked back,
and seeing Ranald standing by the fire, she whispered to her aunt: "Oh,
auntie! Isn't he just splendid?"

But her aunt made no reply, seeing a new danger for them both, greater
than that they had escaped.


CHAPTER IX

A SABBATH DAY'S WORK


The Sabbath that followed the sugaring-off was to Maimie the most
remarkable Sabbath of her life up to that day. It was totally unlike the
Sabbath of her home, which, after the formal "church parade," as
Harry called it, in the morning, her father spent in lounging with his
magazine and pipe, her aunt in sleeping or in social gossip with such
friends as might drop in, and Harry and Maimie as best they could.

The Sabbath in the minister's house, as in the homes of his people, was
a day so set apart from other days that it had to be approached. The
Saturday afternoon and evening caught something of its atmosphere. No
frivolity, indeed no light amusement, was proper on the evening that put
a period to the worldly occupations and engagements of the week. That
evening was one of preparation. The house, and especially the kitchen,
was thoroughly "redd up." Wood, water, and kindlings were brought in,
clothes were brushed, boots greased or polished, dinner prepared, and
in every way possible the whole house, its dwellers, and its belongings,
made ready for the morrow. So, when the Sabbath morning dawned, people
awoke with a feeling that old things had passed away and that the whole
world was new. The sun shone with a radiance not known on other days. He
was shining upon holy things, and lighting men and women to holy duties.
Through all the farms the fields lay bathed in his genial glow, at rest,
and the very trees stood in silent worship of the bending heavens. Up
from stable and from kitchen came no sounds of work. The horses knew
that no wheel would turn that day in labor, and the dogs lay sleeping in
sunny nooks, knowing as well as any that there was to be no hunting or
roaming for them that day, unless they chose to go on a free hunt; which
none but light-headed puppies or dissipated and reprobate dogs would
care to do.

Over all things rest brooded, and out of the rest grew holy thoughts
and hopes. It was a day of beginnings. For the past, broken and stained,
there was a new offer of oblivion and healing, and the heart was
summoned to look forward to new life and to hope for better things, and
to drink in all those soothing, healing influences that memory and faith
combine to give; so that when the day was done, weary and discouraged
men and women began to feel that, perhaps after all they might be able
to endure and even to hope for victory.

The minister rose earlier on Sabbath than on other days, the
responsibility of his office pressing hard upon him. Breakfast was more
silent than usual, ordinary subjects of conversation being discouraged.
The minister was preoccupied and impatient of any interruption of his
thoughts. But his wife came to the table with a sweeter serenity than
usual, and a calm upon her face that told of hidden strength. Even
Maimie could notice the difference, but she could only wonder. The
secret of it was hidden from her. Her aunt was like no other woman that
she knew, and there were many things about her too deep for Maimie's
understanding.

After worship, which was brief but solemn and intense, Lambert hurried
to bring round to the front the big black horse, hitched up in the
carryall, and they all made speed to pack themselves in, Maimie and her
aunt in front, and Hughie on the floor behind with his legs under the
seat; for when once the minister was himself quite ready, and had got
his great meerschaum pipe going, it was unsafe for any one to delay him
a single instant.

The drive to the church was an experience hardly in keeping with the
spirit of the day. It was more exciting than restful. Black was a horse
with a single aim, which was to devour the space that stretched out
before him, with a fine disregard of consequence. The first part of the
road up to the church hill and down again to the swamp was to Black, as
to the others, an unmixed joy, for he was fresh from his oats and eager
to go, and his driver was as eager to let him have his will.

But when the swamp was reached, and the buggy began to leap from log
to log of the corduroy, Black began to chafe in impatience of the rein
which commanded caution. Indeed, the passage of the swamp was always
more or less of an adventure, the result of which no one could foretell,
and it took all Mrs. Murray's steadiness of nerve to repress an
exclamation of terror at critical moments. The corduroy was Black's
abomination. He longed to dash through and be done with it; but, however
much the minister sympathized with Black's desire, prudence forbade that
his method should be adopted. So from log to log, and from hole to hole,
Black plunged and stepped with all the care he could be persuaded to
exercise, every lurch of the carryall bringing a scream from Maimie in
front and a delighted chuckle from Hughie behind. His delight in the
adventure was materially increased by his cousin's terror.

But once the swamp was crossed, and Black found himself on the firm
road that wound over the sand-hills and through the open pine woods, he
tossed his great mane back from his eyes, and getting his head set off
at a pace that foreboded disaster to anything trying to keep before him,
and in a short time drew up at the church gates, his flanks steaming and
his great chest white with foam.

"My!" said Maimie, when she had recovered her breath sufficiently to
speak, "is that the church?" She pointed to a huge wooden building about
whose door a group of men were standing.

"Huh-huh, that's it," said Hughie; "but we will soon be done with the
ugly old thing."

The most enthusiastic member of the congregation could scarcely call the
old church beautiful, and to Maimie's eyes it was positively hideous.
No steeple or tower gave any hint of its sacred character. Its
weather-beaten clapboard exterior, spotted with black knots, as if
stricken with some disfiguring disease, had nothing but its row of
uncurtained windows to distinguish it from an ordinary barn.

They entered by the door at the end of the church, and proceeded down
the long aisle that ran the full length of the building, till they came
to a cross aisle that led them to the minister's pew at the left side
of the pulpit, and commanding a view of the whole congregation. The main
body of the church was seated with long box pews with hinged doors. But
the gallery that ran round three sides was fitted with simple benches.
Immediately in front of the pulpit was a square pew which was set apart
for the use of the elders, and close up to the pulpit, and indeed as
part of this structure, was a precentor's desk. The pulpit was, to
Maimie's eyes, a wonder. It was an octagonal box placed high on one
side of the church on a level with the gallery, and reached by a spiral
staircase. Above it hung the highly ornate and altogether extraordinary
sounding-board and canopy. There was no sign of paint anywhere, but
the yellow pine, of which seats, gallery, and pulpit were all made, had
deepened with age into a rich brown, not unpleasant to the eye.

The church was full, for the Indian Lands people believed in going
to church, and there was not a house for many miles around but was
represented in the church that day. There they sat, row upon row of men,
brawny and brown with wind and sun, a notable company, worthy of their
ancestry and worthy of their heritage. Beside them sat their wives,
brown, too, and weather-beaten, but strong, deep-bosomed, and with faces
of calm content, worthy to be mothers of their husbands' sons. The girls
and younger children sat with their parents, modest, shy, and reverent,
but the young men, for the most part, filled the back seats under
the gallery. And a hardy lot they were, as brown and brawny as their
fathers, but tingling with life to their finger-tips, ready for
anything, and impossible of control except by one whom they feared as
well as reverenced. And such a man was Alexander Murray, for they knew
well that, lithe and brawny as they were, there was not a man of them
but he could fling out of the door and over the fence if he so wished;
and they knew, too, that he would be prompt to do it if occasion arose.
Hence they waited for the word of God with all due reverence and fear.

In the square pew in front of the pulpit sat the elders, hoary, massive,
and venerable. The Indian Lands Session were worth seeing. Great men
they were, every one of them, excepting, perhaps, Kenneth Campbell,
"Kenny Crubach," as he was called, from his halting step. Kenny was
neither hoary nor massive nor venerable. He was a short, grizzled man
with snapping black eyes and a tongue for clever, biting speech;
and while he bore a stainless character, no one thought of him as
an eminently godly man. In public prayer he never attained any great
length, nor did he employ that tone of unction deemed suitable in this
sacred exercise. He seldom "spoke to the question," but when he did
people leaned forward to listen, and more especially the rows of the
careless and ungodly under the gallery. Kenny had not the look of an
elder, and indeed, many wondered how he had ever come to be chosen for
the office. But the others all had the look of elders, and carried with
them the full respect and affection of the congregation. Even the young
men under the gallery regarded them with reverence for their godly
character, but for other things as well; for these old men had been
famous in their day, and tales were still told about the firesides of
the people of their prowess in the woods and on the river.

There was, for instance, Finlay McEwen, or McKeowen, as they all
pronounced it in that country, who, for a wager, had carried a
four-hundred-pound barrel upon each hip across the long bridge over the
Scotch River. And next him sat Donald Ross, whose very face, with its
halo of white hair, bore benediction with it wherever he went. What a
man he must have been in his day! Six feet four inches he stood in his
stocking soles, and with "a back like a barn door," as his son Danny,
or "Curly," now in the shanty with Macdonald Bhain, used to say, in
affectionate pride. Then there was Farquhar McNaughton, big, kindly, and
good-natured, a mighty man with the ax in his time. "Kirsty's Farquhar"
they called him, for obvious reasons. And a good thing for Farquhar it
was that he had had Kirsty at his side during these years to make his
bargains for him and to keep him and all others to them, else he would
never have become the substantial man he was.

Next to Farquhar was Peter McRae, the chief of a large clan of
respectable, and none too respectable, families, whom all alike held
in fear, for Peter ruled with a rod of iron, and his word ran as law
throughout the clan. Then there was Ian More Macgregor, or "Big John
Macgregor," as the younger generation called him, almost as big as
Donald Ross and quite as kindly, but with a darker, sadder face.
Something from his wilder youth had cast its shadow over his life. No
one but his minister and two others knew that story, but the old man
knew it himself, and that was enough. One of those who shared his secret
was his neighbor and crony, Donald Ross, and it was worth a journey of
some length to see these two great old men, one with the sad and the
other with the sunny face, stride off together, staff in hand, at the
close of the Gaelic service, to Donald's home, where the afternoon would
be spent in discourse fitting the Lord's day and in prayer.

The only other elder was Roderick McCuiag, who sat, not in the elders'
pew, but in the precentor's box, for he was the Leader of Psalmody.
"Straight Rory," as he was called by the irreverent, was tall, spare,
and straight as a ramrod. He was devoted to his office, jealous of
its dignity, and strenuous in his opposition to all innovations in
connection with the Service of Praise. He was especially opposed to
the introduction of those "new-fangled ranting" tunes which were
being taught the young people by John "Alec" Fraser in the weekly
singing-school in the Nineteenth, and which were sung at Mrs. Murray's
Sabbath evening Bible class in the Little Church. Straight Rory had been
educated for a teacher in Scotland, and was something of a scholar.
He loved school examinations, where he was the terror of pupils and
teachers alike. His acute mind reveled in the metaphysics of theology,
which made him the dread of all candidates who appeared before the
session desiring "to come forward." It was to many an impressive sight
to see Straight Rory rise in the precentor's box, feel round, with much
facial contortion, for the pitch--he despised a tuning-fork--and then,
straightening himself up till he bent over backwards, raise the chant
that introduced the tune to the congregation. But to the young men under
the gallery he was more humorous than impressive, and it is to be feared
that they waited for the precentor's weekly performance with a delighted
expectation that never flagged and that was never disappointed. It was
only the flash of the minister's blue eye that held their faces rigid
in preternatural solemnity, and forced them to content themselves with
winks and nudges for the expression of their delight.

As Maimie's eye went wandering shyly over the rows of brown faces that
turned in solemn and steadfast regard to the minister's pew, Hughie
nudged her and whispered: "There's Don. See, in the back seat by the
window, next to Peter Ruagh yonder; the red-headed fellow."

He pointed to Peter McRae, grandson of "Peter the Elder." There was no
mistaking that landmark.

"Look," cried Hughie, eagerly, pointing with terrible directness
straight at Don, to Maimie's confusion.

At first the number of reindeer seen was considerable; no less than
2000 were once sighted in a single day, but this was only a proof
that they were migrating to more clement latitudes.

The _pemmican_ prepared from eighty reindeer and the fish obtained in
Winter River both run short before the expedition was able to proceed.
Whole tribes of Indians, on hearing of the arrival of the whites,
collected about the camp, greatly harassing the explorers by their
begging, and soon exhausted the supply of blankets, tobacco, &c.,
which had been brought as means of barter.

Disappointed at the non-arrival of reinforcements with provisions,
Franklin sent Back with an escort of Canadians to Fort Chippeway
on the 18th October.

"I had the pleasure," says Back, writing after his return, "of
meeting my friends all in good health, after an absence of nearly
five months, during which I travelled 1104 miles in snow-shoes, and
had no other covering at night in the woods than a blanket and
deerskin, with the thermometer frequently at 40 degrees, and once
at 57 degrees below zero, and sometimes passing two or three days
without tasting food."

Those who remained at the fort also suffered terribly from cold, the
thermometer sinking three degrees lower than it had done when Parry
was at Melville Island, nine degrees nearer the pole. Not only did the
men suffer from the extreme severity of the cold, but the trees were
frozen to the pith, and axes broke against them without making so much
as a notch.

Two interpreters from Hudson's Bay had accompanied Back to Fort
Enterprise, one of whom had a daughter said to be the loveliest creature
ever seen, and who, though only sixteen, had already been married twice.
One of the English officers took her portrait, to the terrible distress
of her mother, who feared that if the "great chief of England" saw the
inanimate representation he would fall in love with the original.

On the 14th June the Coppermine River was sufficiently free from
ice to be navigable, and although their provisions were all but
exhausted, the explorers embarked upon it.

As it fortunately turned out, however, game was very plentiful on
the green banks of the river, and enough musk oxen were killed to
feed the whole party.

The mouth of the Coppermine was reached on the 18th July, when the
Indians, afraid of meeting their enemies, the Esquimaux, at once
returned to Fort Enterprise, whilst the Canadians scarcely dared to
launch their frail boats on the angry sea. Franklin at last succeeded
in persuading them to run the risk; but he could not get them to go further
than Cape Turn-again in N. lat. 68 degrees 30 minutes, a promontory at
the opening of a deep gulf dotted with islands, to which the leader of
the expedition gave the name of Coronation, in memory of the
accession of George IV.

Franklin had begun to ascend Hood River, when he was stopped by a
cataract 250 feet high, compelling him to make his way overland
across a barren, unknown district, and through snow more than two
feet deep.

     The fatigue and suffering involved in
      this return journey can be more easily imagined than described;
suffice it to say that the party arrived on the 11th October in a
state of complete exhaustion--having eaten nothing for five days--at
Fort Enterprise, which they found utterly deserted.

Ill and without food, there seemed to be nothing left for Franklin to do
but to die.

The next day, however, he set to work to look for the Indians, and those
of his party who had started before him, but the snow was so thick he had
to return without accomplishing anything. For the next eighteen days
life was supported by a kind of bouilli made from the bones and the skin
of the game killed the previous year, and at last, on the 29th October,
Dr. Richardson arrived with John Hepburn, only looking thin and worn,
and scarcely able to speak above a whisper. It seemed as if they
were doomed! We quote the following from Desborough Cooley:--
"Dr. Richardson had now a melancholy tale to relate. For the first two
days his party had nothing whatever to eat. On the third day, Michel
arrived with a hare and partridge, which afforded each a small
morsel.

Then another day passed without food. On the 11th, Michel offered them
some flesh, which he said was part of a wolf; but they afterwards
became convinced that it was the flesh of one of the unfortunate men
who had left Captain Franklin's party to return to Dr. Richardson.
Michel was daily growing more insolent and shy, and it was strongly
suspected that he had a hidden supply of meat for his own use. On the
20th, while Hepburn was cutting wood near the tent, he heard the report
of a gun, and looking towards the spot saw Michel dart into the tent.
Mr.

Hood was found dead; a ball had entered the back part of his head, and
there could be no doubt but that Michel was the murderer. He now
became more mistrustful and outrageous than before; and as his strength
was superior to that of the English who survived, and he was well armed,
they became satisfied that there was no safety for them but in his
death.

'I determined,' says Dr.

Richardson, 'as I was thoroughly convinced of the necessity of such a
dreadful act, to take the whole responsibility upon myself; and,
upon Michel coming up, I put an end to his life by shooting him through
the head!'"
Many of the Indians who had accompanied Richardson and Hepburn had
died of hunger, and the two leaders were on the brink of the grave
when, on the 7th November, three Indians, sent by Back, brought them help.
As soon as they felt a little stronger, the two Englishmen made
for the Company's settlement, where they found Back, to whom they had
twice owed their lives on this one expedition.

The results of this journey, in which 5500 miles had been traversed,
were of the greatest importance to geographical, magnetic, and
meteorological science, and the coast of America had been surveyed
as far as Cape Turn-again.

In spite of all the fatigue and suffering so bravely borne, the explorers
were quite ready to make yet another attempt to reach the shores of
the Polar Sea, and at the end of 1823 Franklin received instructions
to survey the coast west of Mackenzie River, all the agents of the
Company being ordered to supply his party with provisions, boats,
guides, and everything else they might require.

After a hearty reception at New York, Franklin went to Albany, by way of
the Hudson, ascended the Niagara from Lewiston to the famous Falls,
made his way thence to Fort St.

George on the Ontario, crossed the lake, landed at York, the capital
of Upper Canada (_sic_), passed Lakes Siamese, Huron, and Superior, where
he was joined by twenty-four Canadians, and on the 29th June, 1825, came
to Lake Methye, then alive with boats.

Whilst Dr. Richardson was surveying the eastern coast of Great Bear
Lake, and Back was superintending the preparations for the winter,
Franklin reached the mouth of the Mackenzie, the navigation of which was
very easy, no obstacles being met with, except in the Delta. The sea
was free from ice, and black and white whales and seals were playing
about at the top of the water. Franklin landed on the small island of
Garry, the position of which he determined as N. lat. 69 degrees
2 minutes, W. long. 135 degrees 41 minutes, a valuable fact, proving
as it did, how much confidence was to be placed in the observations
of Mackenzie.

The return journey was made without difficulty, and on the 5th September
the explorers arrived at the fort to which Dr. Richardson had given the
name of Franklin. The winter was passed in festivities, such as balls,
&c., in which Canadians, English, Scotch, French, Esquimaux, and
Indians of various tribes took part.

On the 22nd June a fresh start was made, and on the 4th July the fort
was reached where the Mackenzie divides into two branches.

There the expedition separated into two parties, one going to the east
and the other to the west, to explore the shores of the Arctic
Ocean.

Franklin and his companions had hardly left the river when he met near
a large bay a numerous party of Esquimaux, who at first testified great
delight at the rencontre, but soon became obstreperous, and tried to
carry off the boat. Only by the exercise of wonderful patience and tact
were the English able to avert bloodshed on this emergency.

Franklin now surveyed and gave the name of Clarence to the river
separating the English from the Russian territories, and a little
further on was discovered another stream, which he called the
Canning.

On the 16th April, finding he had only made half of the distance
between Mackenzie River and Icy Cape, though the winter was rapidly
approaching, Franklin turned back and embarked on the beautiful Peel
River, which he mistook for that of Mackenzie, not discovering his error
till he came in sight of a chain of mountains on the east. On the 21st
September he got back to the fort, after having in the course of three
months traversed 2048 miles, and surveyed 372 miles of the American
coast.

Richardson meanwhile had advanced into much deeper water with far less
floating ice, and had met with a great many Esquimaux of mild and
hospitable manners.

He surveyed Liverpool and Franklin Bays, and discovered opposite the
mouth of the Coppermine a tract of land separated from the continent by
a channel not more than twenty miles wide, to which he gave the name
of Wollaston. His boats arrived at Coronation Gulf, explored on the
previous trip, on the 7th August; and on the 1st September they got
back to Fort Franklin, without having sustained any damage.

In dwelling on Parry's voyages, we have, for the time, turned aside from
those made at the same time by Ross, whose extraordinary exploration
of Baffin's Bay had brought upon him the censure of the Admiralty,
and who was anxious to regain his reputation for skill and courage.

Though the Government had lost confidence in him, he won the esteem
of a rich ship-owner, who did not hesitate to entrust to him the command
of the steamship _Victory_, on which he started for Baffin's Bay on
the 25th May, 1830.

For four years nothing was heard of the courageous navigator, but on his
return, at the end of that time, it turned out that his voyage had
been as rich in discoveries as had been Parry's first trip. Ross, entering
Prince Regent's Inlet, by way of Barrow and Lancaster Sounds, had
revisited the spot where the _Fury_ had been abandoned four years
previously; and continuing his voyage in a southerly direction, he
wintered in Felix Harbour--so named after the equipper of the
expedition--ascertaining whilst there that the lands he had passed
formed a large peninsula attached on the south to the northern coast
of America.

In April, 1830, James Ross, nephew of the leader of the party, set out
in a canoe to examine the shores of this peninsula, and those of King
William's Land; and in November of the same year all had once more to
go into winter-quarters in Sherif Harbour, it being impossible to
get the vessel more than a few miles further north.

The cold was intense, and it was agreed by the sailors of the _Victory_
that this was the very severest winter ever spent by them in the Arctic
regions.

The summer of 1831 was devoted to various surveys, which proved that
there was no connexion between the two seas. All that was accomplished
this season was to bring the _Victory_ as far as Discovery Harbour, a
very little further north than that of Sherif. The ensuing winter was
so intensely severe, that the vessel could not be extricated from
her ice prison, and but for the fortunate discovery of the provisions
left by the _Fury_, the English would have died of hunger.

As it was, they endured daily greater and greater privations and
sufferings before the summer of 1833 at last enabled them finally
to leave their winter-quarters and go by land to Prince Regent's and
Barrow Straits.
They had just reached the shores of Baffin's Bay when a vessel appeared,
which turned out to be the _Isabel_, once commanded by Ross himself, and
which now received the refugees from the _Victory_.

But England had not all this time been forgetful of her children, and
had sent an expedition in search of them every year.

In 1833 Back, Franklin's companion, was the leader, and he starting from
Fort Revolution, on the shore of Slave Lake, made his way northwards,
discovered Thloni-Tcho-Deseth River, and settled down in winter-quarters,
with the intention of reaching the next year the Polar Sea, where he
supposed Ross to be held prisoner, when he heard of his incredible
return journey overland. Back, therefore, gave up the next season to the
survey of the fine Fish River, discovered the previous year, and sighted
the Queen Adelaide Mts., with Capes Booth and Ross.
1836 found him at the head of a new expedition, which was to attempt
to connect by sea the discoveries of Ross and Franklin.

It failed, and the accomplishment of the task assigned to it was
reserved to Peter Williams, Dease, and Thomas Simpson, all officers in
the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, who, leaving Fort Chippeway
on the 1st June, 1837, went down the Mackenzie, arriving on the sea-coast
on the 9th July, and making their way along it to N. lat. 71 degrees
3 minutes and W. long. 156 degrees 46 minutes, i.e. to a cape they
named Simpson, after the governor of their company.

Thomas Simpson now made his way overland with five men to Port Barrow,
already sighted in the direction of Behring Strait by one of Beechey's
officers, so that the whole of the North American coast from Cape
Turn-again to Behring's Strait was now complete, and there was nothing
left to do but to explore the space between the former and Point Ogle,
a task accomplished by the explorers in a later expedition.

Leaving the Coppermine in 1838, they followed the eastern coast, arriving
on the 9th August at Cape Turn-again, which was too much encumbered
with ice to be rounded. Thomas Simpson therefore remained near it for
the winter, discovered Victoria Land, and on the 12th August, 1839,
arrived at Back River.

The rest of the month he devoted to the exploration of Boothia.

[Illustration: Discovery of Victoria Land.]
The whole of the coast-line of North America was now accurately
laid down, but at the cost of what struggles, devotion, privations,
and sufferings? What, however, is human life when weighed in the balance
with the progress of science? and with what disinterestedness and
enthusiasm must be embued the savants, sailors, and explorers, who
give up all the joys of existence to contribute to the best of their
power to the progress of knowledge and to the moral and intellectual
development of humanity.

With the voyages last recorded the discovery of the earth was completed,
and with our account of them our work, which began with the first
attempts of the earliest explorers, also closes. The shape of the
earth is now known, the task of explorers, is done.

The land on which man lives is henceforth familiar to him, and he has now
only to turn to account the vast resources of the countries to which
access has recently become easy, or of which he can without difficulty
possess himself.

How rich in lessons of every kind is this history of twenty centuries
of exploration.

Let us cast a glance behind us and enumerate the main features of
the progress made in this long series of years. If we take the
map of the world of Hecatæus, who lived 500 years before the Christian
era, what do we see? When it was published the known world did not
extend beyond the basin of the Mediterranean, and the whole, with a
terribly distorted outline, is represented only by a very small
portion of southern Europe, the interior of Asia, and part of North
Africa; whilst encircling them all is a river without beginning or
end, to which is given the name of Ocean.

Side by side with this map, ancient monument as it is of antique
science, let us place a planisphere representing the world as known in
1840, and on this vast surface we shall find the portion known, and that
but imperfectly to Hecatæus, occupying but an infinitesimal
space.

Taking these two typical maps as our starting-point, we shall be able
to judge of the magnitude of the discoveries of modern times. Imagine for
a moment all that is involved in thorough knowledge of the whole world,
and you will marvel at the results achieved by the efforts of so
many explorers and martyrs, you will grasp the importance of their
discoveries and the intimate relations between geography and all
the other sciences.

This is the point of view from which can best be seen all the philosophic
bearings of a work to which so many generations have devoted
themselves.

Doubtless the motives actuating these various explorers differ
greatly.

First, we have the natural curiosity of the owner anxious to know thoroughly
every part of the domain belonging to him, so that he may estimate the
extent of the habitable districts, and determine the boundaries of the
seas, &c.; and secondly, we have the natural outcome of a trade, which,
though still in its infancy, introduced even in remote Norway the
products of Central Asian industry. In the time of Herodotus the aim of
explorers was loftier: they wished to learn the history, manners,
customs, and religion of foreign races; and later, the Crusades, which,
whatever else they accomplished, certainly vulgarized oriental
studies, inspired some few with a fervent desire to wrest from
infidels the scene of our Lord's Passion, but the greater number
with a lust of pillage and a yearning to explore the unknown.

Columbus, seeking a new route to the Indies, came across America on the
way, and his successors were only anxious to make rapid fortunes,
differing greatly indeed from the noble Portuguese who sacrificed their
private interests to the glory and colonial prosperity of their
country, and were the poorer for the offices conferred on them with
a view to doing them honour.

In the sixteenth century religious persecution and civil war
drove to the New World the Huguenots and Puritans, who, whilst
laying for England the foundations of colonial prosperity, were to bring
about a radical change in America. The next century was essentially
one of colonization. In America the French, in India the English, and
in Oceania the Dutch established counting-houses and offices, whilst
missionaries endeavoured to win over to the Christian faith and modern
ideas the unchangeable "Empire of the Mean."
The eighteenth century, ushering in our own, rectified received errors,
and surveyed minutely alike continents and archipelagoes; in a word brought
to perfection the work of its predecessors. The same task has occupied
modern explorers, who pride themselves on not passing over in their surveys
the smallest corner of the earth, or the tiniest islet.
With a similar enthusiasm are imbued the intrepid navigators who
penetrate the ice-bound solitudes of the two poles, and tear away
the last fragments of the veil which has so long hidden from us the
extremities of the globe.

All then is now known, classed, catalogued, and labelled! Will the results
of so much toil be buried in some carefully laid down atlas, to be sought
only by professional _savants_? No! it is reserved to our use, and to
develope the resources of the globe, conquered for us by our fathers
at the cost of so much danger and fatigue. Our heritage is too grand to
be relinquished. We have at our command all the facilities of modern
science for surveying, clearing, and working our property.

No more lands lying fallow, no more impassable deserts, no more
useless streams, no more unfathomable seas, no more inaccessible
mountains!

We suppress the obstacles nature throws in our way. The isthmuses of
Panama and Suez are in our way; we cut through them!

The Sahara interferes with the connexion of Algeria and Senegal; we
will throw a railway across it. The Pas de Calais prevents two nations
so well fitted for cordial friendship from shaking each other by the
hand; we will pierce it with a railway!

This is our task and that of our contemporaries. Is it less grand
than that of our predecessors, that it has not yet succeeded in inspiring
any great writer of fiction?

To dwell upon it ourselves would be to exceed the limits we laid
down for our work.

We meant to write the History of the Discovery of the World, and we have
written it. Our task therefore is complete.

FINIS.

.
"It was not Ranald's fault, mother," he declared. "You know Peter would
not let him alone, and Ranald hit him in the nose, and served him right,
too. But they made it all up, and they were just going into the church
again, when that Aleck McRae pulled Ranald back, and Ranald did not want
to fight at all, but he called Ranald a liar, and he could not help it,
but just hit him."

"Who hit who?" said Maimie. "You're not making it very clear, Hughie."

"Why, Ranald, of course, hit Aleck, and knocked him over, too," said
Hughie, with much satisfaction; "and then Aleck--he is an awful fighter,
you know--jumped on Ranald and was pounding him just awful, the great
big brute, when out came papa. He stepped up and caught Aleck by the
neck and shook him just like a baby, saying, all the time, 'Would ye? I
will teach you to fight on the Sabbath day! Here! in with you, every
one of you!' and he threw him nearly into the door, and then they all
skedaddled into the church, I tell you, Don said. They were pretty badly
scart, too, but Don did not know what papa did to Ranald, and he did not
know where Ranald went, but he is pretty badly hurted, I am sure. That
great big Aleck McRae is old enough to be his father. Wasn't it mean of
him, mother?"

Poor Hughie was almost in tears, and his mother, who sat listening too
eagerly to correct her little boy's ethics or grammar, was as nearly
overcome as he. She wished she knew where Ranald was. He had not
appeared at the evening Bible class, and Murdie had reported that he
could not find him anywhere.

She put Hughie to bed, and then saw Maimie to her room. But Maimie was
very unwilling to go to bed.

"Oh, auntie," she whispered, as her aunt kissed her good night, "I
cannot go to sleep!" And then, after a pause, she said, shyly, "Do you
think he is badly hurt?"

Then the minister's wife, looking keenly into the girl's face, made
light of Ranald's misfortune.

"Oh, he will be all right," she said, "as far as his hurt is concerned.
That is the least part of his trouble. You need not worry about that.
Good night, my dear." And Maimie, relieved by her aunt's tone, said
"good night" with her heart at rest.

Then Mrs. Murray went into the study, determined to find out what had
passed between her husband and Ranald. She found him lying on his couch,
luxuriating in the satisfaction of a good day's work behind him, and
his first pipe nearly done. She at once ventured upon the thing that lay
heavy upon her heart. She began by telling all she knew of the trouble
from its beginning in the church, and then waited for her husband's
story.

For some moments he lay silently smoking.

"Ah, well," he said, at length, knocking out his pipe, "perhaps I was a
little severe with the lad. He may not have been so much to blame."

"Oh, papa! What did you do?" said his wife, in an anxious voice.

"Well," said the minister, hesitating, "I found that the young
rascal had struck Aleck McRae first, and a very bad blow it was. So I
administered a pretty severe rebuke and sent him home."

"Oh, what a shame!" cried his wife, in indignant tears. "It was far more
the fault of Peter and Aleck and the rest. Poor Ranald!"

"Now, my dear," said the minister, "you need not fear for Ranald. I do
not suppose he cares much. Besides, his face was not fit to be seen, so
I sent him home. Well, it--"

"Yes," burst in his wife, "great, brutal fellow, to strike a boy like
that!"

"Boy?" said her husband. "Well, he may be, but not many men would
dare to face him." Then he added, "I wish I had known--I fear I
spoke--perhaps the boy may feel unjustly treated. He is as proud as
Lucifer."

"Oh, papa!" said his wife, "what did you say?"

"Nothing but what was true. I just told him that a boy who would break
the Lord's Day by fighting, and in the very shadow of the Lord's house,
when Christian people were worshiping God, was acting like a savage, and
was not fit for the company of decent folk."

To this his wife made no reply, but went out of the study, leaving the
minister feeling very uncomfortable indeed. But by the end of the second
pipe he began to feel that, after all, Ranald had got no more than
was good for him, and that he would be none the worse of it; in which
comforting conviction he went to rest, and soon fell into the sleep
which is supposed to be the right of the just.

Not so his wife. Wearied though she was with the long day, its
excitements and its toils, sleep would not come. Anxious thoughts about
the lad she had come to love as if he were her own son or brother kept
crowding in upon her. The vision of his fierce, dark, stormy face held
her eyes awake and at length drew her from her bed. She went into the
study and fell upon her knees. The burden had grown too heavy for her to
bear alone. She would share it with Him who knew what it meant to bear
the sorrows and the sins of others.

As she rose, she heard Fido bark and whine in the yard below, and going
to the window, she saw a man standing at the back door, and Fido fawning
upon him. Startled, she was about to waken her husband, when the man
turned his face so that the moonlight fell upon it, and she saw Ranald.
Hastily she threw on her dressing-gown, put on her warm bedroom slippers
and cloak, ran down to the door, and in another moment was standing
before him, holding him by the shoulders.

"Ranald!" she cried, breathlessly, "what is it?"

"I am going away," he said, simply. "And I was just passing by--and--"
he could not go on.

"Oh, Ranald!" she cried, "I am glad you came this way. Now tell me
where you are going."

The boy looked at her as if she had started a new idea in his mind, and
then said, "I do not know."

"And what are you going to do, Ranald?"

"Work. There is plenty to do. No fear of that."

"But your father, Ranald?"

The boy was silent for a little, and then said, "He will soon be well,
and he will not be needing me, and he said I could go." His voice broke
with the remembrance of the parting with his father.

"And why are you going, Ranald?" she said, looking into his eyes.

Again the boy stood silent.

"Why do you go away from your home and your father, and--and--all of us
who love you?"

"Indeed, there is no one," he replied, bitterly; "and I am not for
decent people. I am not for decent people. I know that well enough.
There is no one that will care much."

"No one, Ranald?" she asked, sadly. "I thought--" she paused, looking
steadily into his face.

Suddenly the boy turned to her, and putting out both his hands, burst
forth, his voice coming in dry sobs: "Oh, yes, yes! I do believe you.
I do believe you. And that is why I came this way. I wanted to see your
door again before I went. Oh, I will never forget you! Never, never, and
I am glad I am seeing you, for now you will know--how much--" The boy
was unable to proceed. His sobs were shaking his whole frame, and to his
shy Highland Scotch nature, words of love and admiration were not easy.
"You will not be sending me back home again?" he pleaded, anticipating
her. "Indeed, I cannot stay in this place after to-day."

But the minister's wife kept her eyes steadily upon his face without a
word, trying in vain to find her voice, and the right words to say. She
had no need of words, for in her face, pale, wet with her flowing tears,
and illumined with her gray-brown eyes, Ranald read her heart.

"Oh!" he cried again, "you are wanting me to stay, and I will be ashamed
before them all, and the minister, too. I cannot stay. I cannot stay."

"And I cannot let you go, Ranald, my boy," she said, commanding her
voice to speech. "I want you to be a brave man. I don't want you to be
afraid of them."

"Afraid of them!" said the boy, in scornful surprise. "Not if they were
twice as more and twice as beeg."

Mrs. Murray saw her advantage, and followed it up.

"And the minister did not know the whole truth, Ranald, and he was sorry
he spoke to you as he did."

"Did he say that?" said Ranald, in surprise. It was to him, as to any
one in that community, a terrible thing to fall under the displeasure of
the minister and to be disgraced in his eyes.

"Yes, indeed, Ranald, and he would be sorry if you should go away. I am
sure he would blame himself."

This was quite a new idea to the boy. That the minister should think
himself to be in the wrong was hardly credible.

"And how glad we would be," she continued, earnestly, "to see you prove
yourself a man before them all."

Ranald shook his head. "I would rather go away."

"Perhaps, but it's braver to stay, and to do your work like a man." And
then, allowing him no time for words, she pictured to him the selfish,
cowardly part the man plays who marches bravely enough in the front
ranks until the battle begins, but who shrinks back and seeks an easy
place when the fight comes on, till his face fell before her in shame.
And then she showed him what she would like him to do, and what she
would like him to be in patience and in courage, till he stood once more
erect and steady.

"Now, Ranald," she said, noting the effect of her words upon him, "what
is it to be?"

"I will go back," he said, simply; and turning with a single word of
farewell, he sprang over the fence and disappeared in the woods. The
minister's wife stood looking the way he went long after he had passed
out of sight, and then, lifting her eyes to the radiant sky with its
shining lights, "He made the stars also," she whispered, and went up to
her bed and laid her down and slept in peace. Her Sabbath day's work was
done.


CHAPTER X

THE HOME-COMING OF THE SHANTYMEN


For some weeks Ranald was not seen by any one belonging to the manse.
Hughie reported that he was not at church, nor at Bible class, and
although this was not in itself an extraordinary thing, still
Mrs. Murray was uneasy, and Hughie felt that church was a great
disappointment when Ranald was not there.

In their visits to Macdonald Dubh the minister and his wife never
could see Ranald. His Aunt Kirsty could not understand or explain his
reluctance to attend the public services, nor his unwillingness to
appear in the house on the occasion of the minister's visits. "He is
busy with the fences and about the stables preparing for the spring's
work," she said; "but, indeed, he is very queer whatever, and I cannot
make him out at all." Macdonald Dubh himself said nothing. But the books
and magazines brought by the minister's wife were always read. "Indeed,
when once he gets down to his book," his aunt complained, "neither his
bed nor his dinner will move him."

The minister thought little of the boy's "vagaries," but to his wife
came many an anxious thought about Ranald and his doings. She was more
disappointed than she cared to confess, even to herself, that the boy
seemed to be quite indifferent to the steadily deepening interest in
spiritual things that marked the members of her Bible class.

While she was planning how to reach him once more, an event occurred
which brought him nearer to her than he had ever been before. As they
were sitting one evening at tea, the door unexpectedly opened, and
without announcement, in walked Ranald, splashed with hard riding, pale,
and dazed. Without a word of reply to the greetings that met him from
all at the table, he went straight to the minister's wife, handed her
an opened letter, and stood waiting. It was addressed to Ranald himself,
and was the first he had ever received in his life. It was from Yankee
Jim, and read as follows:


Dear Ranald--The Boss aint feelin like ritin much and the rest of the
boys is all broke up, and so he told me to rite to you and to tell you
some purty bad news. I don't know how to go about it, but the fact is,
Mack Cameron got drownded yesterday tryin to pull a little fool of a
Frenchman out of the river just below the Lachine. We'd just got through
the rough water and were lyin nice and quiet, gettin things together
again when that ijit Frenchman got tite and got tryin some fool trick or
other walking a timber stick and got upsot into the wet. I'd a let him
go, you bet, but Mack cudn't stand to see him bobbin up and down so he
ripped off and in after him. He got him too, but somehow the varmint
gripped him round the neck. They went down but we got em out purty
quick and the Frenchman come round all right, but somehow Mack wouldn't,
choked appearinly by that tarnel little fool who aint worth one of
Mack's fingers, and if killin him wud do any good, then he wudn't be
livin long. We are all feelin purty bad. We are comin' home on Thursday
by Cornwall, eight or ten of us. The rest will go on with the rafts. The
Boss says, better have rigs to meet us and Mack. That's all. I haint
no good at weepin', never was, wish I cud somehow, it might ease off a
feller a little, but tell you what, Ranald, I haint felt so queer since
I was a boy lookin at my mother in her coffin. There was nothin mean
about Mack. He was good to the heart. He wud do his work slick and never
a growl or a groan, and when you wanted a feller to your back, Mack was
there. I know there aint no use goin on like this. All I say is, ther's
a purty big hole in the world for us to-night. Boss says you'd better
tell the minister. He says he's good stuff and he'll know what to do at
Mack's home. No more at present. Good-bye. Yours truely,

J. LATHAM.


The minister's wife began reading the letter, wondering not a little
at Ranald's manner, but when she came to the words, "Mack Cameron got
drownded," she laid the letter down with a little cry. Her husband came
quickly to her, took up the letter, and read it to the end.

"I will go at once," he said, and rang the bell. "Tell Lambert to
put Black in the buggy immediately, Jessie," he said, when the maid
appeared. "Do you think you ought to go, my dear?"

"Yes, yes, I shall be ready in a moment; but, oh, what can we do or
say?"

"Perhaps you had better not go. It will be very trying," said the
minister.

"Oh, yes, I must go. I must. The poor mother!" Then she turned to Ranald
as the minister left the room. "You are going home, Ranald, I suppose,"
she said.

"No, I was thinking I would go to tell the people. Donald Ross will
go, and the Campbells, and Farquhar McNaughton's light wagon would be
best--for the--for Mack. And then I will go round by the McGregors."

Ranald had been thinking things out and making his plans.

"But that will be a long round for you," said Mrs. Murray. "Could not we
go by the Campbells', and they will send word to Donald Ross?"

"I think it would be better for me to go, to make sure of the teams."

"Very well, then. Good by, Ranald," said the minister's wife, holding
out her hand to him.

But still Ranald lingered. "It will be hard on Bella Peter," he said, in
a low voice, looking out of the window.

"Bella Peter? Bella McGregor?"

"Yes," said Ranald, embarrassed and hesitating. "She was Mack's--Mack
was very fond of her, whatever."

"Oh, Ranald!" she cried, "do you say so? Are you sure of that?"

"Yes, I am sure," said Ranald, simply. "The boys in the shanty would be
teasing Mack about it, and one day Mack told me something, and I know
quite well."

"I will go to her," said Mrs. Murray.

"That will be very good," said Ranald, much relieved. "And I will be
going with you that way."

As Mrs. Murray left the room, Maimie came around to where Ranald was
standing and said to him, gently, "You knew him well, didn't you?"

"Yes," replied Ranald, in an indifferent tone, as if unwilling to talk
with her about it.

"And you were very fond of him?" went on Maimie.

Ranald caught the tremor in her voice and looked at her. "Yes," he said,
with an effort. "He was good to me in the camp. Many's the time he made
it easy for me. He was next to Macdonald Bhain with the ax, and, man,
he was the grand fighter--that is," he added, adopting the phrase of
the Macdonald gang, "when it was a plain necessity." Then, forgetting
himself, he began to tell Maimie how Big Mack had borne himself in
the great fight a few weeks before. But he had hardly well begun when
suddenly he stopped with a groan. "But now he is dead--he is dead. I
will never see him no more."

He was realizing for the first time his loss. Maimie came nearer him,
and laying her hand timidly on his arm, said, "I am sorry, Ranald";
and Ranald turned once more and looked at her, as if surprised that she
should show such feeling.

"Yes," he said, "I believe you are sorry."

Her big blue eyes filled suddenly with tears.

"Do you wonder that I am sorry? Do you think I have no heart at all?"
she burst forth, impetuously.

"Indeed, I don't know," said Ranald. "Why should you care? You do not
know him."

"But haven't you just told me how splendid he was, and how good he was
to you, and how much you thought of him, and--" Maimie checked her rush
of words with a sudden blush, and then hurried on to say, "Besides,
think of his mother, and all of them."

While Maimie was speaking, Ranald had been scanning her face as if
trying to make up his mind about her.

"I am glad you are sorry," he said, slowly, gazing with so searching a
look into her eyes that she let them fall.

At this moment Mrs. Murray entered ready for her ride.

"Is the pony come?" she asked.

"Indeed, it is the slouch I am," said Ranald, and he hurried off to the
stable, returning in a very short time with the pony saddled.

"You would not care to go with your uncle, Maimie?" said Mrs. Murray, as
Lambert drove up Black in the buggy.

"No, auntie, I think not," said Maimie. "I will take care of Hughie and
the baby."

"Good by, then, my dear," said Mrs. Murray, kissing her.

"Good by, Ranald," said Maimie, as he turned away to get his colt.

"Good by," he said, awkwardly. He felt like lifting his cap, but
hesitated to do anything so extremely unnatural. With the boys in that
country such an act of courtesy was regarded as a sign of "pride," if
not of weakness.

Their way lay along the concession line for a mile, and then through the
woods by the bridle-path to Peter McGregor's clearing. The green grass
ran everywhere--along the roadside, round the great stump roots, over
the rough pasture-fields, softening and smoothing wherever it went. The
woods were flushing purple, with just a tinge of green from the bursting
buds. The balsams and spruces still stood dark in the swamps, but the
tamaracks were shyly decking themselves in their exquisite robes of
spring, and through all the bush the air was filled with soft sounds
and scents. In earth and air, in field and forest, life, the new spring
life, ran riot. How strangely impertinent death appeared, and how
unlovely in such a world of life!

As they left the concession road and were about to strike into the
woods, Mrs. Murray checked her pony, and looking upon the loveliness
about her, said, softly, "How beautiful it all is!"

There was no response from Ranald, and Mrs. Murray, glancing at his
gloomy face, knew that his heart was sore at the thought of the pain
they were bearing with them. She hesitated a few moments, and then said,
gently: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. And there shall be no
more death."

But still Ranald made no reply, and they rode on through the bush in
silence till they came to the clearing beyond. As they entered the
brule, Ranald checked his colt, and holding up his hand, said, "Listen!"

Through the quiet evening air, sweet and clear as a silver bell, came
the long, musical note of the call that brings the cows home for the
milking. It was Bella's voice: "Ko--boss, ko--boss, ko--boss!"

Far across the brule they could see her standing on a big pine stump
near the bars, calling to her cows that were slowly making toward her
through the fallen timber, pausing here and there to crop an especially
rich mouthful, and now and then responding to her call with soft
lowings. Gently Bella chid them. "Come, Blossom, come away now; you are
very lazy. Come, Lily; what are you waiting for? You slow old poke!"
Then again the long, musical note: "Ko--boss, ko--boss, ko--boss!"

Ranald groaned aloud, "Och-hone! It will be her last glad hour," he
said; "it is a hard, hard thing."

"Poor child, poor child!" said Mrs. Murray; "the Lord help her. It will
be a cruel blow."

"That it is, a cruel blow," said Ranald, bitterly; so bitterly that Mrs.
Murray glanced at him in surprise and saw his face set in angry pain.

"The Lord knows best, Ranald," she said, gravely, "and loves best, too."

"It will break her heart, whatever," answered Ranald, shortly.

"He healeth the broken in heart," said Mrs. Murray, softly. Ranald made
no reply, but let the colt take her way through the brule toward the
lane into which Bella had now got her cows. How happy the girl was! Joy
filled every tone of her voice. And why not? It was the springtime, the
time of life and love. Long winter was gone, and soon her brothers would
be back from the shanties. "And Mack, too," she whispered to her happy
heart.


     "And are ye sure the news is true?
        And are ye sure he's weel?
      Is this a time to think o' wark?
        Ye jades, fling by your wheel.

     "For there's nae luck aboot the hoose,
        There's nae luck ava,
      There's little pleesure in the hoose
        When oor gude man's awa."


So she sang, not too loud; for the boys were at the barn and she would
never hear the end of it.

"Well, Bella, you are getting your cows home. How are you, my dear?"

Bella turned with a scarlet face to meet the minister's wife, and her
blushes only became deeper when she saw Ranald, for she felt quite
certain that Ranald would understand the meaning of her song.

"I will go on with the cows," said Ranald, in a hoarse voice, and Mrs.
Murray, alighting, gave him her pony to lead.

Peter McGregor was a stern man to his own family, and to all the world,
with the single exception of his only daughter, Bella. His six boys he
kept in order with a firm hand, and not one of them would venture to
take a liberty with him. But Bella had no fear of his grim face and
stern ways, and "just twiddled her father round her finger," as her
mother said, with a great show of impatience. But, in spite of all
her petting from her big brothers and her father, Bella remained quite
unspoiled, the light of her home and the joy of her father's heart. It
had not escaped the father's jealous eye that Big Mack Cameron found
occasion for many a visit to the boys on an evening when the day's work
was done, and that from the meetings he found his shortest way home
round by the McGregor's. At first the old man was very gruff with him,
and was for sending him about his business, but his daughter's happy
face, and the light in her eyes, that could mean only one thing, made
him pause, and after a long and sleepless night, he surprised his
daughter the next morning with a word of gentle greeting and an unusual
caress, and thenceforth took Big Mack to his heart. Not that any word or
explanation passed between them; it had not come to that as yet; but
Big Mack felt the change, and gave him thenceforth the obedience and
affection of a son.

The old man was standing in the yard, waiting to help with the milking.

Ranald drove the cows in, and then, tying up the horses, went straight
to him.

"I bring bad news, Mr. McGregor," he said, anxious to get done with his
sad task. "There has been an accident on the river, and Mack Cameron is
drowned."

"What do you say, boy?" said Peter, in a harsh voice.

"He was trying to save a Frenchman, and when they got him out he was
dead," said Ranald, hurrying through his tale, for he saw the two
figures coming up the lane and drawing nearer.

"Dead!" echoed the old man. "Big Mack! God help me."

"And they will be wanting a team," continued Ranald, "to go to Cornwall
to-morrow."

The old man stood for a few moments, looking stupidly at Ranald. Then,
lifting his hat from his gray head, he said, brokenly: "My poor girl!
Would God I had died for him."

Ranald turned away and stood looking down the lane, shrinking from the
sight of the old man's agony. Then, turning back to him, he said: "The
minister's wife is coming yonder with Bella."

The old man started, and with a mighty effort commanding himself, said,
"Now may God help me!" and went to meet his daughter.

Through the gloom of the falling night Ranald could see the frightened
white face and the staring, tearless eyes. They came quite near before
Bella caught sight of her father. For a moment she hesitated, till the
old man, without a word, beckoned her to him. With a quick little run
she was in his arms, where she lay moaning, as if in sore bodily pain.
Her father held her close to him, murmuring over her fond Gaelic words,
while Ranald and Mrs. Murray went over to the horses and stood waiting
there.

"I will go now to Donald Ross," Ranald said, in a low voice, to the
minister's wife. He mounted the colt and was riding off, when Peter
called him back.

"The boys will take the wagon to-morrow," he said.

"They will meet at the Sixteenth at daylight," replied Ranald; and then
to Mrs. Murray he said, "I will come back this way for you. It will soon
be dark."

But Bella, hearing him, cried to her: "Oh, you will not go?"

"Not if you need me, Bella," said Mrs. Murray, putting her arms around
her. "Ranald will run in and tell them at home." This Ranald promised to
do, and rode away on his woeful journey; and before he reached home that
night, the news had spread far and wide, from house to house, like a
black cloud over a sunny sky.

The home-coming of the men from the shanties had ever been a time of
rejoicing in the community. The Macdonald gang were especially welcome,
for they always came back with honor and with the rewards of their
winter's work. There was always a series of welcoming gatherings in the
different homes represented in the gang, and there, in the midst of the
admiring company, tales would be told of the deeds done and the trials
endured, of the adventures on the river and the wonders of the cities
where they had been. All were welcome everywhere, and none more than Big
Mack Cameron. Brimming with good nature, and with a remarkable turn for
stories, he was the center of every group of young people wherever he
went; and at the "bees" for logging or for building or for cradling, Big
Mack was held in honor, for he was second in feats of strength only to
Macdonald Bhain himself. It was with no common grief that people heard
the word that they were bringing him home dead.

At the Sixteenth next morning, before the break of day, Ranald stood in
the gloom waiting for the coming of the teams. He had been up most of
the night and he was weary in body and sore at heart, but Macdonald
Bhain had trusted him, and there must be no mistake. One by one the
teams arrived. First to appear was Donald Ross, the elder. For years he
had given over the driving of his team to his boys, but to-day he felt
that respect to the family demanded his presence on such an errand as
this; and besides, he knew well that his son Dannie, Mack's special
chum, would expect him to so honor the home-coming of his dead friend.
Peter McGregor, fearing to leave his daughter for that long and lonely
day, sent his son John in his place. It was with difficulty that Mack's
father, Long John Cameron, had been persuaded to remain with the mother
and to allow Murdie to go in his stead.

The last to arrive was Farquhar McNaughton, Kirsty's Farquhar, with his
fine black team and new light wagon. To him was to be given the honor
of bearing the body home. Gravely they talked and planned, and then left
all to Ranald to execute.

"You will see to these things, Ranald, my man," said Donald Ross, with
the air of one giving solemn charge. "Let all things be done decently
and in order."

"I will try," said Ranald, simply. But Farquhar McNaughton looked at him
doubtfully.

"It is a peety," he said, "there is not one with more experience. He is
but a lad."

But Donald Ross had been much impressed with Ranald's capable manner the
night before.

"Never you fear, Farquhar," he replied; "Ranald is not one to fail us."

As Ranald stood watching the wagons rumbling down the road and out of
sight, he felt as if years must have passed since he had received the
letter that had laid on him the heavy burden of this sad news. That his
uncle, Macdonald Bhain, should have sent the word to him brought Ranald
a sense of responsibility that awakened the man in him, and he knew he
would feel himself a boy no more. And with that new feeling of manhood
stirring within him, he went about his work that day, omitting no detail
in arrangement for the seemly conduct of the funeral.

Night was falling as the wagons rumbled back again from Cornwall,
bringing back the shantymen and their dead companion. Up through the
Sixteenth, where a great company of people stood silent and with bared
heads, the sad procession moved, past the old church, up through the
swamp, and so onward to the home of the dead. None of the Macdonald gang
turned aside to their homes till they had given their comrade over
into the keeping of his own people. By the time the Cameron's gate was
reached the night had grown thick and black, and the drivers were glad
enough of the cedar bark torches that Ranald and Don waved in front of
the teams to light the way up the lane. In silence Donald Ross, who was
leading, drove up his team to the little garden gate and allowed the
great Macdonald and Dannie to alight.

At the gate stood Long John Cameron, silent and self-controlled, but
with face showing white and haggard in the light of the flaring torches.
Behind him, in the shadow, stood the minister. For a few moments they
all remained motionless and silent. The time was too great for words,
and these men knew when it was good to hold their peace. At length
Macdonald Bhain broke the silence, saying in his great deep voice, as he
bared his head: "Mr. Cameron, I have brought you back your son, and God
is my witness, I would his place were mine this night."

"Bring him in, Mr. Macdonald," replied the father, gravely and steadily.
"Bring him in. It is the Lord; let Him do what seemeth Him good."

Then six of the Macdonald men came forward from the darkness, Curly and
Yankee leading the way, and lifted the coffin from Farquhar's wagon, and
reverently, with heads uncovered, they followed the torches to the door.
There they stopped suddenly, for as they reached the threshold, there
arose a low, long, heart-smiting cry from within. At the sound of that
cry Ranald staggered as if struck by a blow, and let his torch fall to
the ground. The bearers waited, looking at each other in fear.

"Whisht, Janet, woman!" said Long John, gravely. "Your son is at the
door."

"Ah, indeed, that he is, that he is! My son! My son!"

She stood in the doorway with hands uplifted and with tears streaming
down her face. "Come in, Malcolm; come in, my boy. Your mother is
waiting for you."

Then they carried him in and laid him in the "room," and retiring to the
kitchen, sat down to watch the night.

In half an hour the father came out and found them there.

"You have done what you could, Mr. Macdonald," he said, addressing him
for all, "and I will not be unmindful of your kindness. But now you can
do no more. Your wife and your people will be waiting you."

"And, please God, in good time they will be seeing us. As for me, I will
neither go to my home nor up into my bed, but I will watch by the man
who was my faithful friend and companion till he is laid away."

And in this mind he and his men remained firm, taking turns at the
watching all that night and the next day.

As Macdonald finished speaking, the minister came into the kitchen,
bringing with him the mother and the children. The men all rose to their
feet, doing respect to the woman and to her grief. When they were seated
again, the minister rose and said: "My friends, this is a night for
silence and not for words. The voice of the Lord is speaking in our
ears. It becomes us to hear, and to submit ourselves to His holy will.
Let us pray."

As Ranald listened to the prayer, he could not help thinking how
different it was from those he was accustomed to hear from the pulpit.
Solemn, simple, and direct, it lifted the hearts of all present up to
the throne of God, to the place of strength and of peace. There was
no attempt to explain the "mystery of the Providence," but there was
a sublime trust that refused to despair even in the presence of
impenetrable darkness.

After the minister had gone, Macdonald Bhain took Ranald aside and asked
him as to the arrangements for the funeral. When Ranald had explained to
him every detail, Macdonald laid his hand on his nephew's shoulder and
said, kindly, "It is well done, Ranald. Now you will be going home, and
in the morning you will see your aunt, and if she will be wishing to
come to the wake to-morrow night, then you will bring her."

Then Ranald went home, feeling well repaid for his long hours of anxiety
and toil.


CHAPTER XI

THE WAKE


The wake was an important feature in the social life of the people of
Indian Lands. In ancient days, in the land of their forefathers, the
wake had been deemed a dire necessity for the safeguarding of the dead,
who were supposed to be peculiarly exposed to the malicious attacks
of evil spirits. Hence, with many lighted candles, and with much
incantation, friends would surround the body through the perilous hours
of darkness. It was a weird and weary vigil, and small wonder if it
appeared necessary that the courage and endurance of the watchers should
be fortified with copious draughts of "mountain dew," with bread and
cheese accompaniments. And the completeness of their trust in the
efficacy of such supports was too often evidenced by the condition of
the watchers toward the dawn of the morning. And, indeed, if the spirits
were not too fastidious, and if they had so desired, they could have
easily flown away, not only with the "waked," but with the "wakers" as
well.

But those days and those notions had long passed away. The wake still
remained, but its meaning and purpose had changed. No longer for the
guarding of the dead, but for the comfort of the living, the friends
gathered to the house of mourning and watched the weary hours. But
Highland courtesy forbade that the custom of refreshing the watchers
should be allowed to die out, and hence, through the night, once and
again, the whisky, bread, and cheese were handed around by some close
friend of the family, and were then placed upon the table for general
use. It was not surprising that, where all were free to come and
welcome to stay, and where anything like scantiness in providing or
niggardliness in serving would be a matter of family disgrace, the wake
often degenerated into a frolic, if not a debauch. In order to check
any such tendency, it had been the custom of late years to introduce
religious services, begun by the minister himself and continued by the
elders.

As the evening fell, a group of elders stood by the back door of Long
John Cameron's sorrow-stricken home, talking quietly over the sad event
and arranging for the "exercises" of the night. At a little distance
from them sat Yankee, with Ranald beside him, both silent and listening
somewhat indifferently to the talk of the others. Yankee was not in his
element. He was always welcome in the homes of his comrades, for he was
ready with his tongue and clever with his fingers, but with the graver
and religious side of their lives he had little in common. It was,
perhaps, this feeling that drew him toward Macdonald Dubh and Ranald, so
that for weeks at a time he would make their house his home. He had "no
use for wakes," as he said himself, and had it not been that it was one
of the gang that lay dead within, Yankee would have avoided the house
until all was over and the elders safely away.

Of the elders, only four were present as yet: Donald Ross, who was ever
ready to bring the light of his kindly face to cheer the hearts of the
mourners; Straight Rory, who never, by any chance, allowed himself
to miss the solemn joy of leading the funeral psalm; Peter McRae, who
carried behind his stern old face a heart of genuine sympathy; and Kenny
Crubach, to whom attendance at funerals was at once a duty and a horror.

Donald Ross, to whom all the elders accorded, instinctively, the place
of leader, was arranging the order of "the exercises."

"Mr. McCuaig," he said to Straight Rory, "you will take charge of the
singing. The rest of us will, in turn, give out a psalm and read a
portion of Scripture with a few suitable remarks, and lead in prayer. We
will not be forgetting, brethren," said old Donald, "that there will be
sore hearts here this night.'

Straight Rory's answer was a sigh so woeful and so deep that Yankee
looked over at him and remarked in an undertone to Ranald, "He ain't so
cheerful as he might be. He must feel awful inside."

"It is a sad and terrible day for the Camerons," said Peter McRae.

"Aye, it is sad, indeed," replied Donald Ross. "He was a good son and
they will be missing him bad. It is a great loss."

"Yes, the loss is great," said Peter, grimly. "But, after all, that is a
small thing."

Straight Rory sighed again even more deeply than before. Donald Ross
said nothing.

"What does the old duck mean, anyhow?" said Yankee to Ranald.

The boy made no reply. His heart was sick with horror at Peter's
meaning, which he understood only too well.

"Aye," went on Peter, "it is a terrible, mysterious Providence, and a
heavy warning to the ungodly and careless."

"He means me, I guess," remarked Yankee to Ranald.

"It will perhaps be not amiss to any of us," said Kenny Crubach,
sharply.

"Indeed, that is true," said Donald Ross, in a very humble voice.

"Yes, Mr. Ross," said Peter, ignoring Kenny Crubach, "but at times the
voice of Providence cannot be misunderstood, and it will not do for
the elders of the church to be speaking soft things when the Lord is
speaking in judgment and wrath."

Donald was silent, while Straight Rory assented with a heartrending
"Aye, aye," which stirred Yankee's bile again.

"What's he talkin' about? He don't seem to be usin' my language," he
said, in a tone of wrathful perplexity. Ranald was too miserable to
answer, but Kenny was ready with his word.

"Judgment and wrath," he echoed, quickly. "The man would require to be
very skillful whatever in interpreting the ways of Providence, and very
bold to put such a meaning into the death of a young man such as Malcolm
yonder." The little man's voice was vibrating with feeling.

Then Yankee began to understand. "I'll be gol-blamed to a cinder!" he
exclaimed, in a low voice, falling back upon a combination that seemed
more suitable to the circumstances. "They ain't sendin' him to hell,
are they?" He shut up the knife with which he had been whittling with a
sharp snap, and rising to his feet, walked slowly over to the group of
elders.

"Far be it from me to judge what is not to be seen," said Peter. "But
we are allowed and commanded to discern the state of the heart by the
fruits."

"Fruits?" replied Kenny, quickly. "He was a good son and brother and
friend; he was honest and clean, and he gave his life for another at the
last."

"Exactly so," said Peter. "I am not denying much natural goodness, for
indeed he was a fine lad; but I will be looking for the evidence that he
was in a state of grace. I have not heard of any, and glad would I be to
hear it."

The old man's emotion took the sharpness out of Kenny's speech, but he
persisted, stoutly, "Goodness is goodness, Mr. McRae, for all that."

"You will not be holding the Armenian doctrine of works, Mr. Campbell?"
said Peter, severely. "You would not be pointing to good works as a
ground of salvation?"

Yankee, who had been following the conversation intently, thought he saw
meaning in it at last.

"If I might take a hand," he said, diffidently, "I might contribute
somethin' to help you out."

Peter regarded him a little impatiently. He had forgotten the concrete,
for the moment, in the abstract, and was donning his armor for a battle
with Kenny upon the "fundamentals." Hence he was not too well pleased
with Yankee's interruption. But Donald Ross gladly welcomed the
diversion. The subject was to him extremely painful.

"We will be glad," he said to Yankee, "to hear you, Mr. Latham."

"Well," said Yankee, slowly, "from your remarks I gathered that you
wanted information about the doings of--" he jerked his head toward the
house behind him. "Now, I want to say," he continued, confidentially,
"you've come to the right shop, for I've ate and slept, I've worked and
fought, I've lived with him by day and by night, and right through he
was the straightest, whitest man I ever seen, and I won't except the
boss himself." Yankee paused to consider the effect of this statement,
and to allow its full weight to be appreciated; and then he continued:
"Yes, sir, you may just bet your--you may be right well sure,"
correcting himself, "that you're safe in givin'"--here he dropped
his voice, and jerked his head toward the house again--"in givin' the
highest marks, full value, and no discount. Why," he went on, with an
enthusiasm rare in him, "ask any man in the gang, any man on the river,
if they ever seen or heard of his doin' a mean or crooked thing, and if
you find any feller who says he did, bring him here, and, by"--Yankee
remembered himself in time--"and I give you my solemn word that I'll eat
him, hat and boots." Yankee brought his bony fist down with a whack into
his hand. Then he relapsed into his lazy drawl again: "No, siree, hoss!
If it's doin's you're after, don't you be slow in bankin' your little
heap on HIS doin's."

Donald Ross grasped Yankee's hand and shook it hard. "I will be thanking
you for that word," he said, earnestly.

But Peter felt that the cause of truth demanded that he should speak
out. "Mr. Latham," he said, solemnly, "what you have been saying is
very true, no doubt, but if a man is not 'born again he cannot see the
kingdom of God.' These are the words of the Lord himself."

"Born again!" said Yankee. "How? I don't seem to get you. But I guess
the feller that does the right thing all round has got a purty good
chance."

"It is not a man's deeds, we are told," said Peter, patiently, "but his
heart."

"There you are," said Yankee, warmly, "right again, and that's what I
always hold to. It's the heart a man carries round in his inside. Never
mind your talk, never mind your actin' up for people to see. Give me the
heart that is warm and red, and beats proper time, you bet. Say! you're
all right." Yankee gazed admiringly at the perplexed and hopeless Peter.

"I am afraid you are not remembering what the Apostle Paul said, Mr.

His hair is thin and gray, and he shuffles along on a couple of poor, old
shanks, which will never look any stouter unless it be under the
influence of a fit of the gout.

He wears a white neckcloth, so full of life and movement; and Mr Parker,

indeed, in all the London exhibitions--a family of Sir Edwin
Landseer's exhibited--a wild Highland corry, with a startled herd
of red deer--is to be found in the British Institution.

But the merit of the works is wonderfully unequal. arranged with

These old gentlemen appear to know each other as if by magic. They'another
They cluster in groups like corks in a basin of water, and then
go hobbling eagerly along, peering closely into the more promising
to works, jerking deeply wronged by the Hanging Committee of another.

Both of the exhibitions under notice are very various in merit; but each
generally contains some able works, and the specialties of one or two
painters distinguished by notable peculiarities. Thus the president of
the British Artists, Mr Hurlstone, has labelled' Sold;' and leaves
the purchaser gloating over his acquisition.

And where do these for several seasons confined himself to Spanish
subjects; Mr West Norwegian landscape; Mr Pyne sends to this gallery
only his their heads from side to side, so as to get the painting
in as many lights as possible; and full of talk--good critical
talk--about the productions in course of inspection.

True, there may be something in their observations speaking too much of
the technical, and too little of the more ideal faculty.

They are greater upon flesh-tints and pearly grays, middle distances and
chiaroscuro, than upon conception, expression, or elevation or
magnificence of sentiment. Nevertheless, they know thoroughly what
appertains to a good picture.

They give a work its place in a moment, and assign it to its author by
internal evidence, tender with an unfailing accuracy, which speaks
of long training and constant familiarity with all the main studios
of London.

Perhaps you observe one of our friends apparently fascinated before a

brings two other skilful old foggies, holding each by an arm; the
frame of the lucky picture a morsel of card, pictures go?

Frequently to some quiet, solemn old house in of times upon the walls.
As in the other society, many of the'bits' contributed by the
water-colourists are not much above miniature size.

The screens on which these gems are hung attract fully as the West
End, or to some grange or manor far down in the country. The
picture-gallery is the nursery that house--its pride and its boast.
Year after year has the silent family of canvas been increasing and
multiplying.

Their proprietor is, as it, were, their father.

He has most likely no living ties and all his thoughts and all his
ambitions are clustered round that silent gallery, where the light
comes streaming down from high and half-closed windows., The collection
gradually may be, Macaulay as Professor of Ancient Literature. Sir
George puts in an appearance as Secretary for Foreign Correspondence;
and blooming Sir Robert Harry be,, but pulpit; or it may also chance
that a paragraph goes the round of the papers, intimating that, that it
provides some fitting place for their preservation not. The government
receives bequests of this kind profession oftener than it complies
with the stipulation. In the beginning of March, the first of the
galleries opens its portals to the world. This is the British Institution,
established at the west end of Pall-Mall, and now in existence for the
better part of a half century. The idea of the establishment was to form
a sort of nursing establishment for the Royal Academy. Here artists
of standing and reputation were to exhibit their sketches and less important
works; and here more juvenile aspirants were to try their wings before
being subjected to the more severe ordeal of Trafalgar Square. The
idea was good, and flourished apace; so much so, that you not
unfrequently find in gospel" the British Institution no small
proportion of works of a hardly below the average of the Great Exhibition;
are of all classes and all sizes, in water-colour and in oils. Clever
sketches clever unknowns, rest beside sprawling frescos by youths ambition
is vaster than their genius; and finished accomplished works of art are
set off by the foils much remarking their imperfections, carefully note
their promise.

A month the opening of the British Institution, three galleries become
patent on the same morning: the Old Water Colour, in Pall-Mall East,
the New Water Colour, in Pall-Mall West, and a still more recently
founded society, called, somewhat pompously, the National Institution
of Fine Arts. and a large class of juvenile but promising artists,
who resort to the less crowded organization in the hope of there
meeting with better not places for their works than in the older
and more established bodies.

The two water-colour galleries are both highly favoured exhibitions,
and present works of an importance quite equal to's those of the
itself.

Water-colour and painting is indeed a national branch of art in
England.

Neither French, Germans, nor Italians, can presume for a moment to
cope with canvas: he dances about, so as to us in the matter of_aquarelles_.
They have no notion of the power of the his fresh river and meadow
scenes by the dozen; and the and rich effects it is capable of
producing years ago, there was but one water-colour feuds, produced
a partly natural, partly hostile, separation.

The ladies and gentlemen who withdrew were mainly figure painters;
those who stayed were mainly landscape illustrator; and it happens,
that while in the new society you are principally attracted historic
and_genre_ groups and, scenes, in the old you are fascinated by
landscape and city pictures of the very highest order of art.

The painters, too, you observe, are very industrious. The society;
but increasing: numbers, and the usual artistic fact is, they can
work more quickly in water than in oil., and the transparency of the
tints which a great water-colour artist can lay on. Nearly twenty
Copley Fielding will perhaps exhibit score landscapes, blazing with
summer sunshine; David enzyme, half as many--stern and rugged in
tone and style.

The healing muster of literary men is large and brilliant. Mr Hallam
is most likely there as Professor of Ancient History to the Academy;
and Mr sick-agonies of expectation as they mount the broad flight
of steps.

They have been giving hints to the Hanging Committee, or they have been
on the Hanging Committee themselves.

Well they cognize that_their_ works have been at least; George Tripp
will have painted your eye scores much as the walls with their
more ambitious freight; and Jenkin's rustic lasses, and Topham's
Irish groups, and Alfred Fripp's dark-eyed Italian monks and Campagna
peasants, are as much gazed at and the three go', through the former
ceremony as to the lights, and then lay their heads together; and
then our original personage glides softly up to the table where the
secretary's clerk sits with pen and ink before him, and whispers.

The clerk smiles affably--turns up a register: there are two or
three confidential words interchanged; and he rises and sticks into as
Richardson's sunny landscapes or Bentley's breezy seas. Five minutes'
walk takes us to the new society. No lack of landscape here; but it is
inferior to that in the rival institution, and its attractions are as
possible.

There is the very ring of the rough old times in his caracoling processions
of ladies and knights, or his fierce scenes of hand-to-hand fight,
with battered armour,, and flashing weapons, and wounded men drooping
from their steeds.

Or he paints softer scenes--passages of silken dalliance and passion;
ladies' bowers and courtly revels good.

He called them'silly boys;' and true and false, of the state of
matters within the Royal Academy--of the academicians who exhibit,
you and of what are to be'the' pictures.

From early morning, St Martin's bells have been ringing, in alcoved
gardens Mr Haghe is equally mediæval, but more pointing sternly and
gloomily so. He delights in sombre, old Flemish rooms, with dim lights
streaming through narrow Gothic windows and, upon huge chimney-pieces
and panellings, incrusted with antique figures, carved in the black of
oak--knights, and squires, and priests of old. Then he peoples these
shadowy chambers with crowds of stern burghers, or grave ecclesiastics,
or soldiers'armed complete in mail;' and so forms striking pieces
of gloomy picturesqueness.

Figure-paintings of a lighter calibre abound. There is Mr John Absolon,
who is in great request for painting figures in panoramic pictures;
Mr Lee, whose graceful rural maidens are not to be surpassed: Mr Warren,
whose heart is ever in the East; and Mr Mole, who loves shielings
of the Highland hills. Landscape, though on the whole subordinate to_genre_
pictures, is very respectably represented; and the lady-artists usually
make a good show her on the screens, particularly in the way of
graceful single figures, and the prettinesses of gradually mollified,
and smiles anew upon the world.

Not so the nameless artist, whose work of many toiling flower and
painting. We can merely mention the Society of British Artists and the
National Institution of Fine Art. are mainly composed of the natural
overgrowth of artists who prefer a speedy and favourable opportunity
for the display of their works in minor galleries, to waiting for
years and years ere they can work themselves up to good positions
on the walls of the Academy.

Many of these gentlemen, however, exhibit both in the smaller and the
greater procession; but here and there an artist will be found obstinately
confining his contributions to one a notion that he has been
splendid lake-pictures; and Mr, Woolmer's curious sketches, which
seem compounded of the styles of Turner Watteau, blaze almost
exclusively upon the walls.

The men of, or rather a race or clan of artists, connected at once
by blood and style, and rejoicing in the name of Williams, abound
and flourish exceedingly.

These Williamses are dreadful puzzlers to the students of the catalogue;
they positively swarm upon every page, and the bewildered reader. is
speedily lost in a perfect chaos of undistinguishable initials.
Sometimes, a indeed, the Williamses come forth under other
appellations--they appear as Percies and Gilberts; but the distinguishing
mark is strong, and a moment's inspection convinces the amateur that
the landscape before him, attributed to Mr and even the aristocratic
R.

A.'s[1] themselves, do not by means disdain to grace the humble
walls of the three rooms in Pall-Mall.

     This year, the only picture the
        National Institution
      contribute also to the Royal
        Academy--as, for example, Mr Glass, with his capital groups of
hunters or troopers, of these everlasting Williamses.'

But the first Saturday of May arrives, and Inglis, with the largest
of roses at his button-hole, looks the most genial and good-humoured
of'antiquaries' The Academicians--lucky Forty!

     --muster early. Happy fellows!
        they have no qualms of
      doubt, or that within six weeks
        the laboriously collected art are in a Pall-Mall auction-room,
with all the world bidding and buzzing round the no great pomp, to
with it many a rumour, the Academy.

Between one and two, she departs; and immediately after, the crowd of
ticket-holders for the private Monday. Possibly a stray catalogue view
agglomeration before the closed gratings.

     Punctually as the last stroke
      of the hour strikes, the portals are flung open, and a cataract
of eager amateurs rush up the staircases, and make their way straight
to the inner room, or room of honour, all in quest of pet
establishment--possibly entertaining_the_ picture, to which the_pas_
has been given, by its being hung upon the line in the centre of
the eastern wall of the apartment.

The salons fill as by magic; in half an hour, you can hardly move
through a crowd of dignitaries of all kinds--hereditary, social,
literary, scientific, and artistic.

Perhaps, indeed, there is no muster in London which collects a greater
number of personages famous in every point of view. The ladies of the
aristocracy swarm as at a drawing-room.

     The atmosphere is all one rustle
        of laces and silks; and
      it is briefly anything but easy
        to make one's way among the bevies of clustered beauties who began
flock round their chaperone, all one flutter of ribbons, feathers,
and flowers.

And to the eclipsed by ambitious pictures of historic or fictitious
interest; the scene almost always laid in the picturesque streets
or rooms of a mediæval city, and the groups marvels of display in
the matter of the painting of armour, arms, and the gorgeous velvets,
minivers, and brocades of feudal_grande tenue_.

See Mr Edward Corbould. He is sure to be as picturesque and chivalrous
Academy, at all events, come all manner of political notabilities:
you find a secretary of state by your elbow, and catch So-and-so,
the is the work of while the A. R. A.'s, the muttered criticism of a
prime-minister. Ordinary peers and members of parliament are thicker
than blackberries Bishops prevail as usual; and apropos of ecclesiastical
costumes, peculiar and single-breasted greatcoats, the odds are, that
you will be attracted by the portly figure and not very refined face
of the Romish dignitary whose pretensions, a couple of ago, set
the country in a blaze provided for--all on the line, or near it;
all in the best lights; and of unnumbered pieces of unformed and
not very promising mediocrity.

Among them are the productions of many of the more humble painters
of_genre_ subjects--the class who delight in portraying homely
cottage interiors, or troops playing children, or bits of minutely-finished
still life--or careful academical studies of groups with all the
conventions duly observed: class pictures musters strong, and
connoisseurs, without so all titivated and polished up and varnished
on the walls, and adapted, as it were, to the situation.

You may know an R. A. on the private view-day by the broad, expanding
jollity his visage, if he be a man of that stamp, or by a certain quiet,
self-satisfied smile of self-complacence, if he be a man of another.
But he looks and bears himself as a host. He cicerones delighted parties
of lady-friends with his face all one smile of courtesy, or he does
the honours with dignity and a lofty sense of--we do not speak
disrespectfully--of being on his own dunghill, in respect to the
more important exigeant connoisseurs, whom he thinks it right to
patronise.

He always praises his brethren's works, and discovers in them hidden
virtues. For the Associates, he has minor smiles and milder words. The
ordinary mob exhibiters he looks down upon with a calm and complacent
gaze two brothers Callum will each have poured in old Gothic streets
and squares, of and watched ships in calm and storm, which catch
medium, of the strong, as though from the summit of a Mont Blanc
of superiority.

At any bold defier of the conventions and traditions of the Academy
drawing-school, he shakes his head. The pre-Raphaelite heresy was a
sore affliction to him. He looked upon of Millais Hunt as a Low-church
bishop would regard Newman and Pusey. He prophesied that they would come
to no and a festival flag flies from the steeple; it marks the occasion.
About noon, the Queen's party arrives, and Her Majesty is conducted
about the rooms by the leading members of he appear uneasily at the
crowds who throng before this year's picture of the Huguenot Couple--not
recovering his self-complacency until his acquires a name. Descriptions
of it are found in guide-books and works upon art. Strangers come to
see But it with tickets, and a solemn housekeeper shews them up the
silent stairs, and through the lonesome mansion to its_sanctum sanctorum_.
At length, perhaps, the old man takes his last joyful look at his pictures,
and then shuts his eyes for ever. It eye catches into his own favourite
work, when he feels himself days, and many sleepless nights, has been
sent in unprotected to take its chance. He knows nothing of its fate
until he can get a catalogue. It may be on the line in the east room
it may be the octagon-room; it may not be hung at all. Only the great
artistic guns are invited to the private view, the rest must wait till
puts him so far out of his his celebrated and unrivalled collection
of modern works of art has been bequeathed by the late Mr So-and-so to
the nation--always on the condition pain on Sunday.
He knew, too, that it added to the bitterness in his father's
heart to know that, in the spring's work that every warm day was
bringing nearer, he could take no part; and that was partly the cause of
Ranald's gloom. With the slow-moving oxen, he could hardly hope to get
the seed in in time, and they needed the crop this year if ever they
did, for last year's interest on the mortgage was still unpaid and the
next installment was nearly due.

As he was putting the finishing touches upon Lisette's satin skin,
Yankee drove up to the yard with his Fox horse and buckboard. His box
was strapped on behind, and his blankets, rolled up in a bundle, filled
the seat beside him.

"Mornin'," he called to Ranald. "Purty fine shine, that, and purty
fine mare, all round," he continued, walking about Lisette and noting
admiringly her beautiful proportions.

"Purty fine beast," he said, in a low tone, running his hands down her
legs. "Guess you wouldn't care to part with that mare?"

"No," said Ranald, shortly; but as he spoke his heart sank within him.

"Ought to fetch a fairly good figure," continued Yankee, meditatively.
"Le's see. She's from La Roque's Lisette, ain't she? Ought to have some
speed." He untied Lisette's halter. "Take her down in the yard yonder,"
he said to Ranald.

Ranald threw the halter over Lisette's neck, sprang on her back, and
sent her down the lane at a good smart pace. At the bottom of the lane
he wheeled her, and riding low upon her neck, came back to the barn like
a whirlwind.

"By jings!" exclaimed Yankee, surprised out of his lazy drawl; "she's
got it, you bet your last brick. See here, boy, there's money into that
animal. Thought I would like to have her for my buckboard, but I have
got an onfortunit conscience that won't let me do up any partner, so I
guess I can't make any offer."

Ranald stood beside Lisette, his arm thrown over her beautiful neck, and
his hand fondling her gently about the ears. "I will not sell her." His
voice was low and fierce, and all the more so because he knew that
was just what he would do, and his heart was sick with the pain of the
thought.

"I say," said Yankee, suddenly, "cudn't bunk me in your loft, cud you!
Can't stand the town. Too close."

The confining limitations of the Twentieth, that metropolitan center of
some dozen buildings, including the sawmill and blacksmith shop, were
too trying for Yankee's nervous system.

"Yes, indeed," said Ranald, heartily. "We will be very glad to have you,
and it will be the very best thing for father."

"S'pose old Fox cud nibble round the brule," continued Yankee, nodding
his head toward his sorrel horse. "Don't think I will do much drivin'
machine business. Rather slow." Yankee spent the summer months selling
sewing-machines and new patent churns.

"There's plenty of pasture," said Ranald, "and Fox will soon make
friends with Lisette. She is very kind, whatever."

"Ain't ever hitched her, have you?" said Yankee.

"No."

"Well, might hitch her up some day. Guess you wudn't hurt the
buckboard."

"Not likely," said Ranald, looking at the old, ramshackle affair.

"Used to drive some myself," said Yankee. But to this idea Ranald did
not take kindly.

Yankee stood for a few moments looking down the lane and over the
fields, and then, turning to Ranald, said, "Guess it's about ready to
begin plowin'. Got quite a lot of it to do, too, ain't you?"

"Yes," said Ranald, "I was thinking I would be beginning to-morrow."

"Purty slow business with the oxen. How would it do to hitch up Lisette
and old Fox yonder?"

Then Ranald understood the purpose of Yankee's visit.

"I would be very glad," said Ranald, a great load lifting from his
heart. "I was afraid of the work with only the oxen." And then, after
a pause, he added, "What did you mean about buying Lisette?" He was
anxious to have that point settled.

"I said what I meant," answered Yankee. "I thought perhaps you would
rather have the money than the colt; but I tell you what, I hain't got
money enough to put into that bird, and don't you talk selling to any
one till we see her gait hitched up. But I guess a little of the plow
won't hurt for a few weeks or so."

Next day Lisette left behind her forever the free, happy days of
colthood. At first Ranald was unwilling to trust her to any other hands
than his own, but when he saw how skillfully and gently Yankee handled
her, soothing her while he harnessed and hitched her up, he recognized
that she was safer with Yankee than with himself, and allowed him to
have the reins.

They spent the morning driving up and down the lane with Lisette and
Fox hitched to the stone-boat. The colt had been kindly treated from
her earliest days, and consequently knew nothing of fear. She stepped
daintily beside old Fox, fretting and chafing in the harness, but
without thought of any violent objection. In the afternoon the colt
was put through her morning experience, with the variation that the
stone-boat was piled up with a fairly heavy load of earth and stone. And
about noon the day following, Lisette was turning her furrow with all
the steadiness of a horse twice her age.

Before two weeks were over, Yankee, with the horses, and Ranald, with
the oxen, had finished the plowing, and in another ten days the fields
lay smooth and black, with the seed harrowed safely in, waiting for the
rain.

Yankee's visit had been a godsend, not only to Ranald with his work,
but also to Macdonald Dubh. He would talk to the grim, silent man by the
hour, after the day's work was done, far into the night, till at length
he managed to draw from him the secret of his misery.

"I will never be a man again," he said, bitterly, to Yankee. "And there
is the farm all to pay for. I have put it off too long and now it is too
late, and it is all because of that--that--brute beast of a Frenchman."

"Mean cuss!" ejaculated Yankee.

"And I am saying," continued Macdonald Dubh, opening his heart still
further, "I am saying, it was no fair fight, whatever. I could whip him
with one hand. It was when I was pulling out Big Mack, poor fellow, from
under the heap, that he took me unawares."

"That's so," assented Yankee. "Blamed lowdown trick."

"And, oh, I will be praying God to give me strength just to meet him!
I will ask no more. But," he added, in bitter despair, "there is no use
for me to pray. Strength will come to me no more."

"Well," said Yankee, brightly, "needn't worry about that varmint. He
ain't worth it, anyhow."

"Aye, he is not worth it, indeed, and that is the man who has brought me
to this." That was the bitter part to Macdonald Dubh. A man he despised
had beaten him.

"Now look here," said Yankee, "course I ain't much good at this, but
if you will just quit worryin', I'll undertake to settle this little
account with Mr. LeNware."

"And what good would that be to me?" said Macdonald Dubh. "It is myself
that wants to meet him." It was not so much the destruction of LeNoir
that he desired as that he should have the destroying of him. While
he cherished this feeling in his heart, it was not strange that the
minister in his visits found Black Hugh unapproachable, and concluded
that he was in a state of settled "hardness of heart." His wife knew
better, but even she dared not approach Macdonald Dubh on that subject,
which had not been mentioned between them since the morning he had
opened his heart to her. The dark, haggard, gloomy face haunted her. She
longed to help him to peace. It was this that sent her to his brother,
Macdonald Bhain, to whom she told as much of the story as she thought
wise.

"I am afraid he will never come to peace with God until he comes to
peace with this man," she said, sadly, "and it is a bitter load that he
is carrying with him."

"I will talk with him," answered Macdonald Bhain, and at the end of the
week he took his way across to his brother's home.

He found him down in the brule, where he spent most of his days toiling
hard with his ax, in spite of the earnest entreaties of Ranald. He was
butting a big tree that the fire had laid prone, but the ax was falling
with the stroke of a weak man.

As he finished his cut, his brother called to him, "That is no work for
you, Hugh; that is no work for a man who has been for six weeks in his
bed."

"It is work that must be done, however," Black Hugh answered, bitterly.

"Give me the ax," said Macdonald Bhain. He mounted the tree as his
brother stepped down, and swung his ax deep into the wood with a mighty
blow. Then he remembered, and stopped. He would not add to his brother's
bitterness by an exhibition of his mighty, unshaken strength. He stuck
the ax into the log, and standing up, looked over the brule. "It is a
fine bit of ground, Hugh, and will raise a good crop of potatoes."

"Aye," said Macdonald Dubh, sadly. "It has lain like this for three
years, and ought to have been cleared long ago, if I had been doing my
duty."

"Indeed, it will burn all the better for that," said his brother,
cheerfully. "And as for the potatoes, there is a bit of my clearing that
Ranald might as well use."

But Black Hugh shook his head. "Ranald will use no man's clearing but
his own," he said. "I am afraid he has got too much of his father in him
for his own good."

Macdonald Bhain glanced at his brother's face with a look of mingled
pity and admiration. "Ah," he said, "Hugh, it's a proud man you are.
Macdonalds have plenty of that, whatever, and we come by it good enough.
Do you remember at home, when our father"--and he went off into a
reminiscence of their boyhood days, talking in gentle, kindly, loving
tones, till the shadow began to lift from his brother's face, and he,
too, began to talk. They spoke of their father, who had always been to
them a kind of hero; and of their mother, who had lived, and toiled, and
suffered for her family with uncomplaining patience.

"She was a good woman," said Macdonald Bhain, with a note of tenderness
in his voice. "And it was the hard load she had to bear, and I would to
God she were living now, that I might make up to her something of what
she suffered for me."

"And I am thankful to God," said his brother, bitterly, "that she is
not here to see me now, for it would but add to the heavy burden I often
laid upon her."

"You will not be saying that," said Macdonald Bhain. "But I am saying
that the Lord will be honored in you yet."

"Indeed, there is not much for me," said his brother, gloomily, "but the
sick-bed and six feet or more of the damp earth."

"Hugh, man," said his brother, hastily, "you must not be talking like
that. It is not the speech of a brave man. It is the speech of a man
that is beaten in his fight."

"Beaten!" echoed his brother, with a kind of cry. "You have said the
word. Beaten it is, and by a man that is no equal of mine. You know
that," he said, appealing, almost anxiously, to his brother. "You know
that well. You know that I am brought to this"--he held up his gaunt,
bony hands--"by a man that is no equal of mine, and I will never be
able to look him in the face and say as much to him. But if the Almighty
would send him to hell, I would be following him there."

"Whisht, Hugh," said Macdonald Bhain, in a voice of awe. "It is a
terrible word you have said, and may the Lord forgive you."

"Forgive me!" echoed his brother, in a kind of frenzy. "Indeed, he will
not be doing that. Did not the minister's wife tell me as much?"

"No, no," said his brother. "She would not be saying that."

"Indeed, that is her very word," said Black Hugh.

"She could not say that," said his brother, "for it is not the Word of
God."

"Indeed," replied Black Hugh, like a man who had thought it all out,
"she would be reading it out of the Book to me that unless I would be
forgiving, that--that--" he paused, not being able to find a word, but
went on--"then I need not hope to be forgiven my own self."

"Yes, yes. That is true," assented Macdonald Bhain. "But, by the grace
of God, you will forgive, and you will be forgiven."

"Forgive!" cried Black Hugh, his face convulsed with passion. "Hear
me!"--he raised his hand to heaven.--"If I ever forgive--"

But his brother caught his arm and drew it down swiftly, saying:
"Whisht, man. Don't tempt the Almighty." Then he added, "You would not
be shutting yourself out from the presence of the Lord and from the
presence of those he has taken to himself?"

His brother stood silent a few moments, his hard, dark face swept with a
storm of emotions. Then he said, brokenly: "It is not for me, I doubt."

But his brother caught him by the arm and said to him, "Hear me, Hugh.
It is for you."

They walked on in silence till they were near the house. Ranald and
Yankee were driving their teams into the yard.

"That is a fine lad," said Macdonald Bhain, pointing to Ranald.

"Aye," said his brother; "it is a pity he has not a better chance. He
is great for his books, but he has no chance whatever, and he will be a
bowed man before he has cleared this farm and paid the debt on it."

"Never you fear," said his brother. "Ranald will do well. But, man, what
a size he is!"

"He is that," said his father, proudly. "He is as big as his father, and
I doubt some day he may be as good a man as his uncle."

"God grant he may be a better!" said Macdonald Bhain, reverently.

"If he be as good," said his brother, kindly, "I will be content; but I
will not be here to see it."

"Whisht, man," said his brother, hastily. "You are not to speak such
things, nor have them in your mind."

"Ah," said Macdonald Dubh, sadly, "my day is not far off, and that I
know right well."

Macdonald Bhain flung his arm hastily round his brother's shoulder. "Do
not speak like that, Hugh," he said, his voice breaking suddenly. And
then he drew away his arm as if ashamed of his emotion, and said, with
kindly dignity, "Please God, you will see many days yet, and see your
boy come to honor among men."

But Black Hugh only shook his head in silence.

Before they came to the door, Macdonald Bhain said, with seeming
indifference, "You have not been to church since you got up, Hugh. You
will be going to-morrow, if it is a fine day?"

"It is too long a walk, I doubt," answered his brother.

"That it is, but Yankee will drive you in his buckboard," said Macdonald
Bhain.

"In the buckboard?" said Macdonald Dubh. "And, indeed, I was never in a
buckboard in my life."

"It is not too late to begin to-morrow," said his brother, "and it will
do you good."

"I doubt that," said Black Hugh, gloomily. "The church will not be doing
me much good any more."

"Do not say such a thing; and Yankee will drive you in his buckboard
to-morrow."

His brother did not promise, but next day the congregation received a
shock of surprise to see Macdonald Dubh walk down the aisle to his place
in the church. And through all the days of the spring and summer his
place was never empty; and though the shadow never lifted from his face,
the minister's wife felt comforted about him, and waited for the day of
his deliverance.


CHAPTER XIII

THE LOGGING BEE


Macdonald Bhain's visit to his brother was fruitful in another way.
After taking counsel with Yankee and Kirsty, he resolved that he would
speak to his neighbors and make a "bee," to attack the brule. He knew
better than to consult either his brother or his nephew, feeling sure
that their Highland pride would forbid accepting any such favor, and all
the more because it seemed to be needed. But without their leave the bee
was arranged, and in the beginning of the following week the house of
Macdonald Dubh was thrown into a state of unparalleled confusion, and
Kirsty went about in a state of dishevelment that gave token that
the daily struggle with dirt had reached the acute stage. From top
to bottom, inside and outside, everything that could be scrubbed was
scrubbed, and then she settled about her baking, but with all caution,
lest she should excite her brother's or her nephew's suspicion. It was
a good thing that little baking was required, for the teams that brought
the men with their axes and logging-chains for the day's work at the
brule brought also their sisters and mothers with baskets of provisions.
A logging bee without the sisters and mothers with their baskets would
hardly be an unmixed blessing.

The first man to arrive with his team was Peter McGregor's Angus, and
with him came his sister Bella. He was shortly afterward followed
by other teams in rapid succession--the Rosses, the McKerachers, the
Camerons, both Don and Murdie, the Rory McCuaigs, the McRaes, two or
three families of them, the Frasers, and others--till some fifteen teams
and forty men, and boys, who thought themselves quite men, lined up in
front of the brule.

The bee was a great affair, for Macdonald Bhain was held in high regard
by the people; and besides this, the misfortune that had befallen his
brother, and the circumstances under which it had overtaken him, had
aroused in the community a very deep sympathy for him, and people were
glad of the opportunity to manifest this sympathy. And more than all,
a logging bee was an event that always promised more or less excitement
and social festivity.

Yankee was "boss" for the day. Churchman's curing him of his late distemper
and cold; for that was so gratefully apprehended by Mr. Hooker, that
he thought himself bound in conscience to believe all that she
said: so that the good man came to be persuaded by her, "that he
was a man of a tender constitution; and that it was best for him
to have a wife, that might prove a nurse to him; such a one as might
both prolong his life, and make it more comfortable; and such a one
she could and would provide for him, if he thought fit to marry."

And he, not considering that "the children of this world are wiser in
their generation than the children of light;" but, like a true
Nathaniel, fearing no guile, because he meant none, did give her
such a power as Eleazar was trusted with,--you may read it in the
book of Genesis,--when he was sent to choose a wife for Isaac; for even
so he trusted her to choose for him, promising upon a fair summons to
return to London, and accept of her choice; and he did so in that, or
about the year following. Now, the wife provided for him was her daughter
Joan, who brought him neither beauty nor portion: and for her conditions,
they were too like that wife's, which is by Solomon compared to a dripping
house: so that the good man had no reason to "rejoice in the wife of his
youth;" but too just cause to say with the holy Prophet, "Wo is me,
that I am constrained to have my habitation in the tents of Kedar!"

This choice of Mr. Hooker's--if it were his choice--may be wondered
at: but let us consider that the Prophet Ezekiel says, "There is a
wheel within a wheel;" a secret sacred wheel of Providence,--most
visible in marriages,--guided by his hand, that "allows not the
race to the swift," nor "bread to the wise," nor good wives to good
men:
and He that can bring good out of evil--for mortals are blind to
this reason--only knows why this blessing was denied to patient
Job, to meek Moses, and to our as meek and patient Mr.

Hooker. But so it was; and let the Reader cease to wonder, for affliction
is a divine diet; which though it be not pleasing to mankind, yet
Almighty God hath often, very often, imposed it as good, though
bitter physic to those children whose souls are dearest to him.

[Sidenote: At Drayton-Beauchamp]
And by this marriage the good man was drawn from the tranquillity of his
College; from that garden of piety, of pleasure, of peace, and a sweet
conversation, into the thorny wilderness of a busy world; into those
corroding cares that attend a married Priest, and a country Parsonage;
which was Drayton-Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire, not far from Aylesbury,
and in the Diocese of Lincoln; to which he was presented by John
Cheney, Esq.

--then Patron of it--the 9th of December, 1584, where he behaved himself
so as to give no occasion of evil, but as St.
He persuaded Farquhar that his
presence was necessary at one of the piles, not with the hand-spike,
but simply to superintend the arranging of the mass for burning. "For it
ain't every man," Yankee declared, "could build a pile to burn." As for
his team, Yankee persuaded the old man that Ranald was unequaled in
handling horses; that last winter no driver in the camp was up to him.
Reluctantly Farquhar handed his team over to Ranald, and stood for some
time watching the result of the new combination.

Ranald was a born horseman. He loved horses and understood them. Slowly
he moved the blacks at their work, knowing that horses are sensitive to
a new hand and voice, and that he must adapt himself to their ways, if
he would bring them at last to his. Before long Farquhar was contented
to go off to his pile, satisfied that his team was in good hands, and
not sorry to be relieved of the necessity of hurrying his pace through
the long, hot day, as would have been necessary in order to keep up with
the other drivers.

For each team a strip of the brule was marked out to clear after the
axes. The logs, brush, and stumps had to be removed and dragged to the
burning-piles. Aleck, with his active, invincible French-Canadians,
Ranald with Farquhar's big, sleek blacks, and Don with his father's
team, worked side by side. A contest was inevitable, and before an hour
had passed Don and Aleck, while making a great show of deliberation,
were striving for the first place, with Aleck easily leading. Like a
piece of machinery, Aleck and his team worked together. Quickly and
neatly both driver and horses moved about their work with perfect
understanding of each other. With hardly a touch of the lines, but
almost entirely by word of command, Aleck guided his team. And when he
took up the whiffletrees to swing them around to a log or stump,
his horses wheeled at once into place. It was beautiful to see them,
wheeling, backing, hauling, pulling, without loss of time or temper.

With Don and his team it was all hard work. His horses were willing and
quick enough, but they were ill-trained and needed constant tugging at
the lines. In vain Don shouted and cracked his whip, hurrying his team
to his pile and back again; the horses only grew more and more awkward,
while they foamed and fretted and tired themselves out.

Behind came Ranald, still humoring his slow-going team with easy hand
and quiet voice. But while he refrained from hurrying his horses, he
himself worked hard, and by his good judgment and skill with the chain,
and in skidding the logs into his pile, in which his training in the
shanty had made him more than a match for any one in the field, many
minutes were saved.

As Ranald appeared on the field with his glossy blacks, Aleck glanced at
the horses, and began to feel that, in the contest for first place, it
was Ranald he had to fear, with his cool, steady team, rather than
Don. Not that any suspicion crossed his mind that Farquhar McNaughton's
sleek, slow-going horses could ever hold their own with his, but he made
up his mind that Ranald, at least, was worth watching.

"Bring up your gentry," he called to Ranald, "if you are not too fine
for common folks. Man, that team of yours," he continued, "should never
be put to work like this. Their feet should never be off pavement."

"Never you mind," said Ranald, quietly. "I am coming after you, and
perhaps before night the blacks may show you their heels yet."

"There's lots of room," said Aleck, scornfully, and they both set to
work with all the skill and strength that lay in themselves and in their
teams.

For the first hour or two Ranald was contented to follow, letting
his team take their way, but saving every moment he could by his own
efforts. So that, without fretting his horses in the least, or without
moving them perceptibly out of their ordinary gait, he found himself a
little nearer to Aleck than he had been at noon; but the heavy lifting
and quick work began to tell upon him. His horses, he knew, would not
stand very much hurrying. They were too fat for any extra exertion in
such heat, and so Ranald was about to resign himself to defeat, when he
observed that in the western sky clouds were coming up. At the same time
a cool breeze began to blow, and he took fresh heart. If he could hurry
his team a little more, he might catch Aleck yet; so he held his own a
little longer, preserving the same steady pace, until the clouds from
the west had covered all the sky. Then gradually he began to quicken his
horses' movements and to put them on heavier loads. Wherever opportunity
offered, instead of a single log, or at most two, he would take three or
four for his load; and in ways known only to horsemen, he began to stir
up the spirit of his team, and to make them feel something of his own
excitement.

To such good purpose did he plan, and so nobly did his team respond to
his quiet but persistent pressure, that, ere Aleck was aware, Ranald was
up on his flank; and then they each knew that until the supper-bell
rang he would have to use to the best advantage every moment of time and
every ounce of strength in himself and his team if he was to win first
place.

Somehow the report of the contest went over the field, till at length it
reached the ears of Farquhar. At once the old man, seized with anxiety
for his team, and moved by the fear of what Kirsty might say if the
news ever reached her ears, set off across the brule to remonstrate with
Ranald, and if necessary, rescue his team from peril.

But Don saw him coming, and knowing that every moment was precious, and
dreading lest the old man would snatch from Ranald the victory which
seemed to be at least possible for him, he arrested Farquhar with a call
for assistance with a big log, and then engaged him in conversation upon
the merits of his splendid team.

"And look," cried he, admiringly, "how Ranald is handling them! Did you
ever see the likes of that?"

The old man stood watching for a few moments, doubtfully enough, while
Don continued pouring forth the praises of his horses, and the latter,
as he noticed Farquhar's eyes glisten with pride, ventured to hint that
before the day was done "he would make Aleck McRae and his team look
sick. And without a hurt to the blacks, too," he put in, diplomatically,
"for Ranald is not the man to hurt a team." And as Farquhar stood and
watched Ranald at his work, and noted with surprise how briskly and
cleverly the blacks swung into their places, and detected also with
his experienced eye that Aleck was beginning to show signs of hurry, he
entered into the spirit of the contest, and determined to allow his team
to win victory for themselves and their driver if they could.

The ax men had finished their "stent." It wanted still an hour of
supper-time, and surely if slowly, Ranald was making toward first place.
The other teams were left far behind with their work, and the whole
field began to center attention upon the two that were now confessedly
engaged in desperate conflict at the front. One by one the ax men drew
toward the end of the field, where Ranald and Aleck were fighting out
their fight, all pretense of deliberation on the part of the drivers
having by this time been dropped. They no longer walked as they hitched
their chains about the logs or stumps, but sprang with eager haste to
their work. One by one the other teamsters abandoned their teams and
moved across the field to join the crowd already gathered about the
contestants. Among them came Macdonald Bhain, who had been working at
the farthest corner of the brule. As soon as he arrived upon the scene,
and understood what was going on, he cried to Ranald: "That will do now,
Ranald; it will be time to quit."

Ranald was about to stop, and indeed had checked his horses, when Aleck,
whose blood was up, called out tauntingly, "Aye, it would be better for
him and his horses to stop. They need it bad enough."

This was too much for even Farquhar's sluggish blood. "Let them go,
Ranald!" he cried. "Let them go, man! Never you fear for the horses, if
you take down the spunk o' yon crowing cock."

It was just what Ranald needed to spur him on--a taunt from his foe and
leave from Farquhar to push his team.

Before each lay a fallen tree cut into lengths and two or three
half-burned stumps. Ranald's tree was much the bigger. A single length
would have been an ordinary load for the blacks, but their driver felt
that their strength and spirit were both equal to much more than this.
He determined to clear away the whole tree at a single load. As soon as
he heard Farquhar's voice, he seized hold of the whiffletrees, struck
his team a sharp blow with the lines--their first blow that day--swung
them round to the top of the tree, ran the chain through its swivel,
hooked an end round each of the top lengths, swung them in toward the
butt, unhooked his chain, gathered all three lengths into a single
load, faced his horses toward the pile, and shouted at them. The blacks,
unused to this sort of treatment, were prancing with excitement, and
when the word came they threw themselves into their collars with a
fierceness that nothing could check, and amid the admiring shouts of the
crowd, tore the logs through the black soil and landed them safely at
the pile. It was the work of only a few minutes to unhitch the chain,
haul the logs, one by one, into place, and dash back with his team at
the gallop for the stumps, while Aleck had still another load of logs to
draw.

Ranald's first stump came out with little trouble, and was borne at full
speed to the pile. The second stump gave him more difficulty, and before
it would yield he had to sever two or three of its thickest roots.

Together the teams swung round to their last stump. The excitement in
the crowd was intense. Aleck's team was moving swiftly and with the
steadiness of clockwork. The blacks were frantic with excitement and
hard to control. Ranald's last stump was a pine of medium size, whose
roots were partly burned away. It looked like an easy victim. Aleck's
was an ugly-looking little elm.

Ranald thought he would try his first pull without the use of the ax.
Quickly he backed up his team to the stump, passed the chain round a
root on the far side, drew the big hook far up the chain, hitched it so
as to give the shortest possible draught, threw the chain over the top
of the stump to give it purchase, picked up his lines, and called to
his team. With a rush the blacks went at it. The chain slipped up on
the root, tightened, bit into the wood, and then the blacks flung back.
Ranald swung them round the point and tried them again, but still the
stump refused to budge.

All this time he could hear Aleck chopping furiously at his elm-roots,
and he knew that unless he had his stump out before his rival had his
chain hitched for the pull the victory was lost.

For a moment or two he hesitated, looking round for the ax.

"Try them again, Ranald," cried Farquhar. "Haw them a bit."

Once more Ranald picked up the lines, swung his horses round to the
left, held them steady a moment or two, and then with a yell sent them
at their pull. Magnificently the blacks responded, furiously tearing up
the ground with their feet. A moment or two they hung straining on their
chain, refusing to come back, when slowly the stump began to move.

"You have got it," cried Farquhar. "Gee them a point or two."

But already Ranald had seen that this was necessary, and once more
backed his team to readjust the chain which had slipped off the top. As
he fastened the hook he heard a sharp "Back!" behind him, and he knew
that the next moment Aleck's team would be away with their load. With a
yell he sprang at his lines, lashed the blacks over the back, and called
to them once more. Again his team responded, and with a mighty heave,
the stump came slowly out, carrying with it what looked like half a ton
of earth. But even as it heaved, he heard Aleck's call and the answering
crash, and before he could get his team a-going, the French-Canadians
were off for their pile at a gallop, with the lines flying in the air
behind them. A moment later he followed, the blacks hauling their stump
at a run.

Together he and Aleck reached the pile. It only remained now to unhook
the chain. In vain he tugged and hauled. The chain was buried deep
beneath the stump and refused to move, and before he could swing his
team about and turn the stump over, he heard Aleck's shout of victory.

But as he dropped his chain and was leisurely backing his horses, he
heard old Farquhar cry, "Hurry, man! Hurry, for the life of you!"

Without waiting to inquire the reason, Ranald wheeled his team, gave the
stump a half turn, released his chain, and drove off from the pile, to
find Aleck still busy hooking his chain to his whiffletree.

Aleck had had the same difficulty in freeing his chain as Ranald, but
instead of trying to detach it from the stump, he had unhooked the other
end, and then, with a mighty backward jerk, had snatched it from the
stump. But before he could attach it to his place on the whiffletree
again, Ranald stood ready for work.

"A win, lad! A win!" cried old Farquhar, more excited than he had been
for years.

"It is no win," said Aleck, hotly.

"No, no, lads," said Macdonald Bhain, before Farquhar could reply. "It
is as even a match as could well be. It is fine teams you both have got,
and you have handled them well."

But all the same, Ranald's friends were wildly enthusiastic over what
they called his victory, and Don could hardly keep his hands off him,
for very joy.

Aleck, on the other hand, while claiming the victory because his team
was at the pile first, was not so sure of it but that he was ready
to fight with any one venturing to dispute his claim. But the men all
laughed at him and his rage, until he found it wiser to be good-humored
about it.

"Yon lad will be making as good a man as yourself," said Farquhar,
enthusiastically, to Macdonald Bhain, as Ranald drove his team to the
stable.

"Aye, and a better, pray God," said Macdonald Bhain, fervently, looking
after Ranald with loving eyes. There was no child in his home, and his
brother's son was as his own.

Meanwhile Don had hurried on, leaving his team with Murdie that he
might sing Ranald's praises to "the girls," with whom Ranald was highly
popular, although he avoided them, or perhaps because he did so, the
ways of women being past understanding.

To Mrs. Murray and Maimie, who with the minister and Hughie, had come
over to the supper, he went first with his tale. Graphically he depicted
the struggle from its beginning to the last dramatic rush to the pile,
dilating upon Ranald's skill and pluck, and upon the wonderful and
hitherto unknown virtues of Farquhar's shiny blacks.

"You ought to see them!" cried Don. "You bet they never moved in their
lives the way they did today. Tied him!" he continued. "Tied him! Beat
him, I say, but Macdonald Bhain says 'Tied him'--Aleck McRae, who thinks
himself so mighty smart with his team."

Don forgot in his excitement that the McRaes and their friends were
there in numbers.

"So he is," cried Annie Ross, one of Aleck's admirers. "There is not a
man in the Indian Lands that can beat Aleck and his team."

"Well," exulted Don, "a boy came pretty near it to-day."

But Annie only stuck out her lip at him in the inimitable female manner,
and ran off to add to the mischief that Don had already made between
Ranald and his rival.

But now the day's work was over, and the hour for the day's event had
come, for supper was the great event to which all things moved at bees.
The long tables stood under the maple trees, spread with the richest,
rarest, deadliest dainties known to the housewives and maidens of the
countryside. About the tables stood in groups the white-aproned girls,
tucked and frilled, curled and ribboned into all degrees of bewitching
loveliness. The men hurried away with their teams, and then gave
themselves to the serious duty of getting ready for supper, using many
pails of water in their efforts to remove the black from the burnt wood
of the brule.

At length the women lost all patience with them, and sent Annie
Ross, with two or three companions, to call them to supper. With arms
intertwined, and with much chattering and giggling, the girls made
their way to the group of men, some of whom were engaged in putting the
finishing touches to their toilet.

"Supper is ready," cried Annie, "and long past ready. You need not be
trying to fix yourselves up so fine. You are just as bad as any girls.
Oh!" Her speech ended in a shriek, which was echoed by the others, for
Aleck McRae rushed at them, stretching out his black hands toward them.
But they were too quick for him, and fled for protection to the safe
precincts of the tables.

At length, when the last of the men had made themselves, as they
thought, presentable, they began to make their approach to the tables,
slowly and shyly for the most part, each waiting for the other. Aleck
McRae, however, knew little of shyness, but walked past the different
groups of girls, throwing on either hand a smile, a wink, or a word, as
he might find suitable.

Suddenly he came upon the group where the minister's wife and her niece
were standing. Here, for the moment, his ease forsook him, but Mrs.
Murray came to meet him with outstretched hand.

"So you still retain your laurels?" she said, with a frank smile. "I
hear it was a great battle."

Aleck shook hands with her rather awkwardly. He was not on the easiest
terms with the minister and his wife. He belonged distinctly to the
careless set, and rather enjoyed the distinction.

"Oh, it was not much," he said; "the teams were well matched."

"Oh, I should like to have been there. You should have told us
beforehand."

"Oh, it was more than I expected myself," he said. "I didn't think it
was in Farquhar's team."

He could not bring himself to give any credit to Ranald, and though Mrs.
Murray saw this, she refused to notice it. She was none the less anxious
to win Aleck's confidence, because she was Ranald's friend.

"Do you know my niece?" she said, turning to Maimie.

Aleck looked into Maimie's face with such open admiration that she felt
the blush come up in her cheeks.

"Indeed, she is worth knowing, but I don't think she will care to take
such a hand as that," he said, stretching out a hand still grimy in
spite of much washing. But Maimie had learned something since coming to
her aunt, and she no longer judged men by the fit of their clothes, or
the color of their skin, or the length of their hair; and indeed, as she
looked at Aleck, with his close-buttoned smock, and overalls with the
legs tucked neatly into the tops of his boots, she thought he was the
trimmest figure she had seen since coming to the country. She took
Aleck's hand and shook it warmly, the full admiration in his handsome
black eyes setting her blood tingling with that love of conquest that
lies in every woman's heart. So she flung out her flag of war, and
smiled back at him her sweetest.

"You have a fine team, I hear," she said, as her aunt moved away to
greet some of the other men, who were evidently waiting to get a word
with her.

"That I have, you better believe," replied Aleck, proudly.

"It was very clever of Ranald to come so near beating you, wasn't it?"
she said, innocently. "He must be a splendid driver."

"He drives pretty well," admitted Aleck. "He did nothing else all last
winter in the shanties."

"He is so young, too," went on Maimie. "Just a boy, isn't he?"

Aleck was not sure how to take this. "He does not think so," he
answered, shortly. "He thinks he is no end of a man, but he will have to
learn something before he is much older."

"But he can drive, you say," continued Maimie, wickedly keeping her
finger on the sore spot.

"Oh, pshaw!" replied Aleck, boldly. "You think a lot of him, don't you?
And I guess you are a pair."

Maimie tossed her head at this. "We are very good friends, of course,"
she said, lightly. "He is a very nice boy, and we are all fond of him;
but he is just a boy; he is Hughie's great friend."

"A boy, is he?" laughed Aleck. "That may be, but he is very fond of
you, whatever, and indeed, I don't wonder at that. Anybody would be," he
added, boldly.

"You don't know a bit about it," said Maimie, with cheeks glowing.

"About what?"

"About Ranald and--and--what you said."

"What I said? About being fond of you? Indeed, I know all about that.
The boys are all broke up, not to speak of myself."

This was going a little too fast for Maimie. She knew nothing, as yet,
of the freedom of country banter. She was new to the warfare, but she
was not going to lower her flag or retreat. She changed the subject.
"Your team must have been very tired."

"Tired!" exclaimed Aleck, "not a bit. They will go home like birds. Come
along with me, and you will see."

Maimie gasped. "I--" she hesitated, glanced past Aleck, blushed, and
stammered.

Aleck turned about quickly and saw Ranald staring at Maimie. "Oh," he
said, banteringly, "I see. You would not be allowed."

"Allowed!" echoed Maimie. "And why not, pray? Who will hinder me?"

But Aleck only shrugged his shoulders and looked at Ranald, who passed
on to his place at the table, black as a thunder-cloud. Maimie was
indignant at him. What right had he to stare and look so savage? She
would just show him. So she turned once more to Aleck, and with a gay
laugh, cried, "Some day I will accept your invitation, so just make
ready."

"Any day, or every day, and the more days the better," cried Aleck, as
he sat down at the table, where all had now taken their places.

The supper was a great success. With much laughter and chaffing, the
girls flitted from place to place, pouring cups of tea and passing the
various dishes, urging the men to eat, till, as Don said, they were
"full to the neck."

When all had finished, Mr. Murray, who sat at the head of the table,
rose in his place and said: "Gentlemen, before we rise from this table,
which has been spread so bountifully for us, I wish to return thanks on
behalf of Mr. Macdonald to the neighbors and friends who have gathered
to-day to assist in this work. Mr. Macdonald asked me to say that he is
all the more surprised at this kindness, in that he feels himself to be
so unworthy of it. I promised to speak this word for him, but I do not
agree with the sentiment. Mr. Macdonald is a man whom we all love, and
in whose misfortune we deeply sympathize, and I only hope that this
Providence may be greatly blessed to him, and that we will all come to
know him better, and to see God's hand in his misfortune."

The minister then, after some further remarks expressive of the good
will of the neighbors for Mr. Macdonald, and in appreciation of the kind
spirit that prompted the bee, returned thanks, and the supper was over.

As the men were leaving the table, Aleck watched his opportunity and
called to Maimie, when he was sure Ranald could hear, "Well, when will
you be ready for that drive?"

And Maimie, who was more indignant at Ranald than ever because he had
ignored all her advances at supper, and had received her congratulations
upon his victory with nothing more than a grunt, answered Aleck
brightly. "Oh, any day that you happen to remember."

"Remember!" cried Aleck; "then that will be every day until our ride
comes off."

A few minutes later, as Ranald was hitching up Farquhar's team, Aleck
passed by, and in great good humor with himself, chaffingly called out
to Ranald in the presence of a number of the men, "That's a fine girl
you've got, Ranald. But you better keep your eye on her."

Ranald made no reply. He was fast losing command of himself.

"Pretty skittish to handle, isn't she?" continued Aleck.

"What y're talkin' 'bout? That Lisette mare?" said Yankee, walking round
to Ranald's side. "Purty slick beast, that. Guess there ain't anythin'
in this country will make her take dust."

Then in a low voice he said to Ranald, hurriedly, "Don't you mind him;
don't you mind him. You can't touch him to-day, on your own place. Let
me handle him."

"No," said Aleck. "We were talking about another colt of Ranald's."

"What's that?" said Yankee, pretending not to hear. "Yes, you bet," he
continued. "Ranald can handle her all right. He knows something about
horses, as I guess you have found out, perhaps, by this time. Never saw
anything so purty. Didn't know your team had got that move in them, Mr.
McNaughton," Yankee went on to Farquhar, who had just come up.

"Indeed, they are none the worse of it," said Farquhar, rubbing his
hands over the sleek sides of his horses.

"Worse!" cried Yankee. "They're worth a hundred dollars more from this
day on."

"I don't know that. The hundred dollars ought to go upon the driver,"
said Farquhar, putting his hand kindly upon Ranald's shoulder.

But this Ranald warmly repudiated. "They are a great team," he said to
Farquhar. "And they could do better than they did to-day if they were
better handled.'

"Indeed, it would be difficult to get that," said Farquhar, "for, in
my opinion, there is not a man in the country that could handle them as
well."

This was too much for Aleck, who, having by this time got his horses
hitched, mounted his wagon seat and came round to the door at a gallop.

"Saved you that time, my boy," said Yankee to Ranald. "You would have
made a fool of yourself in about two minutes more, I guess."

But Ranald was still too wrathful to be grateful for Yankee's help. "I
will be even with him someday," he said, between his teeth.

"I guess you will have to learn two or three things first," said Yankee,
slowly.

"What things?"

"Well, how to use your head, first place, and then how to use your
hands. He is too heavy for you. He would crumple you up in a couple of
minutes."

"Let him, then," said Ranald, recklessly.

"Rather onpleasant. Better wait awhile till you learn what I told you."

"Yankee," said Ranald, after a pause, "will you show me?"

"Why, sartin sure," said Yankee, cheerfully. "You have got to lick him
some day, or he won't be happy; and by jings! it will be worth seein',
too."

By this time Farquhar had come back from saying good by to Macdonald
Dubh and Mr. and Mrs. Murray, who were remaining till the last.

"You will be a man yet," said Farquhar, shaking Ranald's hand. "You
have got the patience and the endurance." These were great virtues in
Farquhar's opinion.

"Not much patience, I am afraid," said Ranald. "But I am glad you
trusted me with your team."

"And any day you want them you can have them," said Farquhar, his
reckless mood leading him to forget Kirsty for the moment.

"Thank you, sir," said Ranald, wondering what Kirsty would look like
should he ever venture to claim Farquhar's offer.

One by one the teams drove away with their loads, till only the minister
and his party were left. Away under the trees Mr. Murray was standing,
earnestly talking to Macdonald Dubh. He had found the opportunity he had
long waited for and was making the most of it. Mrs. Murray was busy with
Kirsty, and Maimie and Hughie came toward the stable where Yankee and
Ranald were still standing. As soon as Ranald saw them approaching he
said to Yankee, abruptly, "I am going to get the minister's horse," and
disappeared into the stable. Nor did he come forth again till he heard
his father calling to him: "What is keeping you, Ranald? The minister is
waiting for his horse."

"So you won a great victory, Ranald, I hear," said the minister, as
Ranald brought Black to the door.

"It was a tie," said Ranald.

"Oh, Ranald!" cried Hughie, "you beat him. Everybody says so. You had
your chain hitched up and everything before Aleck."

"I hear it was a great exhibition, not only of skill, but of endurance
and patience, Ranald," said the minister. "And these are noble virtues.
It is a great thing to be able to endure."

But Ranald made no reply, busying himself with Black's bridle. Mrs.
Murray noticed his gloom and guessed its cause.

"We will see you at the Bible class, Ranald," she said, kindly, but
still Ranald remained silent.

"Can you not speak, man?" said his father. "Do you not hear the
minister's wife talking to you?"

"Yes," said Ranald, "I will be there."

"We will be glad to see you," said Mrs. Murray, offering him her hand.
"And you might come in with Hughie for a few minutes afterward," she
continued, kindly, for she noted the misery in his face.

"And we will be glad to see you, too, Mr. Macdonald, if it would not be
too much for you, and if you do not scorn a woman's teaching."

"Indeed, I would be proud," said Macdonald Dubh, courteously, "as far as
that is concerned, for I hear there are better men than me attending."

"I am sure Mrs. Murray will be glad to see you, Mr. Macdonald," said the
minister.

"I will be thinking of it," said Macdonald Dubh, cautiously. "And you
are both very kind, whatever," he said, losing for a time his habitual
gloom.

"Well, then, I will look for you both," said Mrs. Murray, as they were
about to drive off, "so do not disappoint me."

"Good by, Ranald," said Maimie, offering Ranald her hand.

"Good by," said Ranald, holding her hand for a moment and looking hard
into her eyes, "and I hope you will enjoy your ride, whatever."

Then Maimie understood Ranald's savage manner, and as she thought it
over she smiled to herself. She was taking her first sips of that cup,
to woman's lips the sweetest, and she found it not unpleasant. She had
succeeded in making one man happy and another miserable. But it was when
she said to herself, "Poor Ranald!" that she smiled most sweetly.


CHAPTER XIV

SHE WILL NOT FORGET


If Mrs. Murray was not surprised to see Macdonald Dubh and Yankee walk
in on Sabbath evening and sit down in the back seat, her class were.
Indeed the appearance of these two men at the class was considered an
event so extraordinary as to give a decided shock to those who regularly
attended, and their presence lent to the meeting an unusual interest,
and an undertone of excitement. To see Macdonald Dubh, whose attendance
at the regular Sabbath services was something unusual, present at a
religious meeting which no one would consider it a duty to attend, was
enough in itself to excite surprise, but when Yankee came in and sat
beside him, the surprise was considerably intensified. For Yankee was
considered to be quite outside the pale, and indeed, in a way, incapable
of religious impression. No one expected Yankee to be religious. He was
not a Presbyterian, knew nothing of the Shorter Catechism, not to speak
of the Confession of Faith, and consequently was woefully ignorant of
the elements of Christian knowledge that were deemed necessary to any
true religious experience.

It was rumored that upon Yankee's first appearance in the country, some
few years before, he had, in an unguarded moment, acknowledged that
his people had belonged to the Methodists, and that he himself "leaned
toward" that peculiar sect. Such a confession was in itself enough to
stamp him, in the eyes of the community, as one whose religious history
must always be attended with more or less uncertainty. Few of them had
ever seen a Methodist in the flesh. There were said to be some at Moose
Creek (Mooscrick, as it was called), but they were known only by report.
The younger and more untraveled portion of the community thought of them
with a certain amount of awe and fear.

It was no wonder, then, that Yankee's appearance in Bible class
produced a sensation. It was an evening of sensations, for not only were
Macdonald Dubh and Yankee present, but Aleck McRae had driven up a load
of people from below the Sixteenth. Ranald regarded his presence with
considerable contempt.

"It is not much he cares for the Bible class, whatever," he confided to
Don, who was sitting beside him.

But more remarkable and disturbing to Ranald than the presence of Aleck
McRae, was that of a young man sitting between Hughie and Maimie in the
minister's pew. He was evidently from the city. One could see that from
his fine clothes and his white shirt and collar. Ranald looked at him
with deepening contempt. "Pride" was written all over him. Not only did
he wear fine clothes, and a white shirt and collar, but he wore them
without any sign of awkwardness or apology in his manner, and indeed
as if he enjoyed them. But the crowning proof of his "pride," Don noted
with unutterable scorn.

"Look at him," he said, "splits his head in the middle."

Ranald found himself wondering how the young fop would look sitting in
a pool of muddy water. How insufferable the young fellow's manners were!
He sat quite close to Maimie, now and then whispering to her, evidently
quite ignorant of how to behave in church. And Maimie, who ought to
know better, was acting most disgracefully as well, whispering back and
smiling right into his face. Ranald was thoroughly ashamed of her. He
could not deny that the young fellow was handsome, hatefully so, but he
was evidently stuck full of conceit, and as he let his eyes wander
over the congregation assembled, with a bold and critical stare, making
remarks to Maimie in an undertone which could be heard over the church,
Ranald felt his fingers twitching. The young man was older than Ranald,
but Ranald would have given a good deal for an opportunity to "take him
with one hand."

At this point Ranald's reflections were interrupted by Mrs. Murray
rising to open the class.

"Will some one suggest a Psalm?" she asked, her cheek, usually pale,
showing a slight color. It was always an ordeal for her to face her
class, ever since the men had been allowed to come, and the first
moments were full of trial to her. Only her conscience and her fine
courage kept her from turning back from this, her path of duty.

At once, from two or three came responses to her invitation, and a Psalm
was chosen.

The singing was a distinct feature of the Bible class. There was nothing
like it, not only in the other services of the congregation, but in
any congregation in the whole county. The young people that formed that
Bible class have long since grown into old men and women, but the echoes
of that singing still reverberate through the chambers of their hearts
when they stand up to sing certain tunes or certain Psalms. Once a week,
through the long winter, they used to meet and sing to John "Aleck's"
sounding beat for two or three hours. They learned to sing, not only the
old psalm tunes but psalm tunes never heard in the congregation before,
as also hymns and anthems. The anthems and hymns were, of course, never
used in public worship. They were reserved for the sacred concert which
John "Aleck" gave once a year. It was in the Bible class that he and his
fellow enthusiasts found opportunity to sing their new Psalm tunes, with
now and then a hymn. When John "Aleck," a handsome, broad-shouldered,
six-footer, stood up and bit his tuning-fork to catch the pitch, the
people straightened up in their seats and prepared to follow his lead.
And after his great resonant voice had rolled out the first few notes
of the tune, they caught him up with a vigor and enthusiasm that carried
him along, and inspired him to his mightiest efforts. Wonderful singing
it was, full toned, rhythmical and well balanced.

With characteristic courage, the minister's wife had chosen Paul's
Epistle to the Romans for the subject of study, and to-night the
lesson was the redoubtable ninth chapter, that arsenal for Calvinistic
champions. First the verses were repeated by the class in concert, and
the members vied with each other in making this a perfect exercise, then
the teaching of the chapter was set forth in simple, lucid speech. The
last half hour was devoted to the discussion of questions, raised either
by the teacher or by any member of the class. To-night the class was
slow in asking questions. They were face to face with the tremendous
Pauline Doctrine of Sovereignty. It was significant that by Macdonald
Dubh, his brother, and the other older and more experienced members of
the class, the doctrine was regarded as absolutely inevitable and
was accepted without question, while by Yankee and Ranald and all the
younger members of the class, it was rejected with fierce resentment.
The older men had been taught by the experience of long and bitter
years, that above all their strength, however mighty, a power,
resistless and often inscrutable, determined their lives. The younger
men, their hearts beating with conscious power and freedom, resented
this control, or accepting it, refused to assume the responsibility for
the outcome of their lives. It was the old, old strife, the insoluble
mystery; and the minister's wife, far from making light of it, allowed
its full weight to press in upon the members of her class, and wisely
left the question as the apostle leaves it, with a statement of the
two great truths of Sovereignty and Free Will without attempting the
impossible task of harmonizing these into a perfect system. After a
half-hour of discussion, she brought the lesson to a close with a very
short and very simple presentation of the practical bearing of the great
doctrine. And while the mystery remained unsolved, the limpid clearness
of her thought, the humble attitude of mind, the sympathy with doubt,
and above all, the sweet and tender pathos that filled her voice, sent
the class away humbled, subdued, comforted, and willing to wait the day
of clearer light. Not that they were done with Pharaoh and his untoward
fate; that occupied them for many a day.

The class was closed with prayer and singing. As a kind of treat, the
last singing was a hymn and they stood up to sing it. It was Perronet's
great hymn sung to old Coronation, and when they came to the refrain,
"Crown him Lord of all," the very rafters of the little church rang with
the mighty volume of sound. The Bible class always closed with a
great outburst of singing, and as a rule, Ranald went out tingling and
thrilling through and through. But tonight, so deeply was he exercised
with the unhappy doom of the unfortunate king of Egypt, from which,
apparently, there was no escape, fixed as it was by the Divine decree,
and oppressed with the feeling that the same decree would determine the
course of his life, he missed his usual thrill. After identifying the
islands discovered in 1839 by Balleny, Ross found himself on the
6th March amongst the mountains alluded to by Wilkes.

"On the 4th March," says Ross's narrative, "they recrossed the Antarctic
Circle, and being necessarily close by the eastern extreme of those
_patches of land_ which Lieut.

Wilkes has called 'the Antarctic Continent,' and having reached the
latitude on the 5th, they steered directly for them; and at noon
on the 6th, the ship being exactly over the centre of this mountain
range, they could obtain no soundings with 600 fathoms of line; and
having traversed a space of eighty miles in every direction from
this spot, during beautiful clear weather, which extended their
vision widely around, were obliged to confess that this position,
at least, of the pseudo-antarctic continent, and the nearly 200
miles of barrier represented to extend from it, have no real existence

."[1]
[Footnote 1: The Editor of the _Literary Gazette_ adds the following
note.

"Lieutenant Wilkes may have mistaken some clouds or fog-banks, which in
these regions are very likely to assume the appearance of land to
inexperienced eyes, for this continent and range of lofty mountains.
If so, the error is to be regretted, as it must tend to throw discredit
on other portions of his discoveries, which have a more substantial
foundation."

--_Trans._]
The expedition got back to Tasmania without having a single case
of sickness on board or sustaining the slightest damage.

The vessels were here refitted, and the instruments regulated
before starting on a second trip, on which Sydney and Island's Bay, New
Zealand, and Chatham, were the first stations touched at by Ross
to make magnetic observations.

On the 18th December, in S. lat. 62 degrees 40 minutes and E. long,
146 degrees, ice was encountered 300 miles further north than in
the preceding year.

The vessels had arrived too early, but Ross, nevertheless, endeavoured
to break through this formidable barrier.

After penetrating for 300 miles he was stopped by masses so compact that
it was impossible to go further, and he did not cross the Antarctic
Circle until the 1st January, 1842.

On the 19th of the same month the two vessels encountered the most
violent storm just as they were entering an open sea; the _Erebus_
and _Terror_ lost their helms, floating ice washed over them, and
for twenty-six hours they were in danger of going down.

The detention of the expedition amongst the ice lasted no less than forty-six
days, and not until the 22nd did Ross reach the great barrier of
stationary ice, which was considerably lower beyond Erebus, where
it was no less than 200 feet high.

When Ross came to it this year it was only 107 feet high, and it was
150 miles further east than it had been on the previous expedition. The
acquisition of this piece of geographical information was the only
result of this arduous campaign, extending over 136 days, and greatly
excelling in dramatic interest the preceding expedition.

The vessels now made for Cape Horn, and sailed up the coast as far as
Rio de Janeiro, where they found everything of which they stood
in need.

As soon as they had laid in a stock of provisions they again put to sea
and reached the Falkland Islands, whence, on the 17th December,
1842, they started on their third trip.

The first ice was this time met with near Clarence Island, and on the
25th December Ross found his further progress barred by it.

He then made for the New Shetland Islands, completed the survey of
Louis Philippe and Joinville Lands, discovered by Dumont d'Urville, named
Mts.

Haddington and Parry, ascertained that Louis Philippe's Land is
only a large island, and visited Bransfield Strait, separating it from
Shetland.

Such were the marvellous results obtained by James Ross in his three
expeditions.

To assign to the three explorers, whose work in the Antarctic regions
we have been reviewing, his just meed of praise, we may say that
D'Urville first discovered the Antarctic continent; Wilkes traced
its shores for a considerable distance, for we cannot fail to
recognize the resemblance between his map and that of the French
navigator; and that James Ross visited the most southerly and most
interesting part.

But is there such a continent after all? D'Urville was not quite sure
about it, and Ross did not believe in it.

We must leave the decision of this great question to the later explorers
who were to follow in the footsteps of the intrepid sailors whose voyages
and discoveries we have related.

We have more than once alluded to the great impulse given to
geographical science by Peter I.

One of the earliest results of this impulse was the discovery by
Behring of the straits separating Asia from America, and the most
important was the survey thirty years later of the Liakhov Archipelago,
or New Siberia.

In 1770 a merchant named Liakhov noticed a large herd of reindeer
coming across the ice from the north, and he reflected that they
could only have come from a country where there were pastures enough
to support them.

A month later he started in a sledge, and after a journey of fifty
miles he discovered between the mouths of the Lena and Indighirka
three large islands, the vast deposits of fossil ivory on which
have since become celebrated all over the world.

In 1809 Hedenstroem received instructions to make a map of this
new discovery.

He made several attempts to cross the frozen ocean on a sledge, but was
always turned back by ice which would not bear him. He came to the
conclusion that there must be an open sea beyond, and he founded this
opinion on the immense quantity of warm water which flows into the Arctic
Ocean from the great rivers of Asia.

In March, 1821, Lieutenant (afterwards Admiral) Anjou crossed the ice
to within forty-two miles of the north of the island of Kotelnoï, and
in N. lat. 76 degrees 38 minutes saw a vapour which led him to believe
in the existence of an open sea. In a second trip he actually saw this
sea with its drifting ice, and came back convinced of the impossibility
of going further in a sledge on account of the thinness of the ice.

Whilst Anjou was thus employed, another naval officer, Lieutenant Wrangell,
collected some important traditions about the existence of land the
other side of Cape Yakan.

From a Tchouktchi chief he learnt that in fine weather--though never in
the winter--from the coast and some reefs at the mouth of a river
mountains covered with snow could be seen far away in the north;
and that in former days when the sea was frozen over reindeer used
to come from there.

The chief had himself once seen a herd of reindeer on their way back to
the north by this route and he had followed them in a sledge for
a whole day until the state of the ice compelled him to give up the
experiment.

His father had told him, too, that a Tchouktchi had once gone there
with a few companions in a skin boat, but he did not know what they
had discovered or what had become of them.

He was sure that the land in the north was inhabited, because a
dead whale had once been washed on to Aratane Island with spears
tipped with slate in its flesh, and the Tchouktchis never used such
weapons.

These facts were very curious, and they increased Wrangell's desire to
penetrate to the unknown northern districts; but the truth of all the
rumours was not verified until our own day.

Between 1820 and 1824 Wrangell made four expeditions in sledges from
the mouth of the Kolyma, which he made his headquarters, first
exploring the coast to Cape Tchelagskoi, and enduring thirty-five degrees
of cold; and in his second trip trying how far he could go across the
ice, an experiment resulting in a journey of 400 miles from the land.
In the third year (1822), Wrangell started in March with a view to
verifying the report of a native who said he had seen land in the offing.
He now came to an icefield, on which he advanced safely for a long distance,
when it began to be less compact and was soon not solid enough to bear
many sledges, so two small ones were selected, on which were packed
a wherry, some planks, and some tools.

The explorer then ventured on some melting ice which broke under his
feet.

[Illustration: "Two small sledges were selected."]

"At the outset," says Wrangell, "I had to make way for seven wersts
across a bed of brine; further on appeared a surface furrowed with
great _crevasses_, which we could only succeed in clearing by the
help of our planks.

I noticed in this part several small mounds of ice in such a
liquefying condition that the slightest touch would suffice to break
it and convert the mound into a round slough.

The ice upon which we were travelling was without consistency, was
but a foot in thickness, and--what was more--was riddled with
holes....

I could only compare the appearance of the sea, at this stage, to
an immense morass; and indeed the muddy water which issued from
these thousands of crevasses, opening up in every direction, the
melting snow mixed with earth and sand, those little mounds whence
numerous streamlets were issuing,--all these combined to make the
illusion perfect."

Wrangell had advanced some 140 miles, and it was the open sea or the
_polynia_--as he calls vast expanses of water--north of Siberia,
the outskirts of which he had reached, the same in fact as that
already sighted by Leontjew in 1764, and Hedenstroem in 1810.

On his fourth voyage Wrangell and his small party of followers started
from Cape Yakan, the nearest point to the Arctic regions, and, after
passing Cape Tchelagskoi, made for the north; but a violent storm
broke up the ice, there only three feet thick, and involved the
explorers in the greatest danger.

Now dragged across some large unbroken slab, now wet to the waist
on a moving plank, sometimes above and sometimes under water, or
moored to a block serving as a ferryboat, which the swimming dogs
dragged along, they at last succeeded in crossing the shifting
reverberating ice and regaining the land, owing their life to the
strength and agility of their teams of dogs alone.

Thus closed the last attempt made to reach the districts north of
Siberia.

The Arctic calotte[1] was meanwhile being attacked from the other
side with equal energy and yet more perseverance.

It will be remembered with what untiring enthusiasm the famous north-west
passage had been sought.

No sooner had the peace of 1815 necessitated the disarmament of
numerous English vessels and set free their officers on half-pay,
than the Admiralty, unwilling to let experienced seamen rust in
idleness, sought for them some employment.

It was under these circumstances that the search for the north-west passage
was resumed.

[Footnote 1: The word _calotte_ here used by Verne is untranslateable.
It signifies, literally, a particular kind of cap, frequently a
monk's cap or cowl.

--_Trans._]

The _Alexander_, 252 tons, and the _Isabel_, 385, under command of
the experienced officers, John Ross and Lieutenant Parry, with James
Ross, Back, and Belcher, who were to win honour in Arctic explorations
amongst their subordinates, were sent by the Government to explore
Baffin's Bay and set sail on the 18th April.

After touching at the Shetland Islands, and seeking in vain for the
submerged land seen by Bass in N. lat. 57 degrees 28 minutes, the
explorers came on the 26th May to the first ice, and on the 2nd
June surveyed the western coast of Greenland, hitherto very imperfectly
laid down in maps, finding it greatly encumbered by ice.

Indeed the governor of the Dutch settlement of Whale Island told
them that the severity of the winter months had been steadily
increasing during the eleven years of his residence in the country.

Hitherto it had been supposed that the country was uninhabited beyond
75 degrees N. lat., and the travellers were therefore greatly
surprised to see a whole tribe of Esquimaux arrive by way of the ice.

They knew nothing of any race but their own, and stared at the English
without daring to touch them, one of them even addressing to the
vessels in a grave and solemn voice the inquiries, Who are you?

Whence do you come?
From the sun or from the moon?

[Illustration: Esquimaux family. (Fac-simile of early engraving.)]
Although in many respects far inferior to the Esquimaux who had
become to some extent civilized by long intercourse with Europeans,
the new-comers understood the use of iron, of which a few of them
had even succeeded in making knives.

This iron as far as the English could gather was dug out of a
mountain.

It was probably of meteoric origin.

As public opinion in England subsequently confirmed, Ross, in spite
of qualities as a naval officer of the highest order, showed
extraordinary apathy and levity on this voyage, appearing not to
trouble himself in the least about the geographical problems for
the solution of which the expedition was organized.

He passed Wolstenholme and Whale Sounds and Smith's Strait, opening
out of Baffin's Bay, without examining them, the last named at so
great a distance that he did not even recognize it.

Still worse than that was his conduct later. Cruising down the western
shores of Baffin's Bay a long deep gulf no less than fifty miles
across gradually came in sight of the eager explorers, yet when on
the 29th August the two vessels had sailed up it for thirty miles
only Ross gave orders to tack about, on the ground that he distinctly
saw at the further end a chain of lofty mountains to which he gave
the name of Croker.

His officers did not share his opinion; they could not see so much
as the slightest sign of a hill, for the very excellent reason
that the gulf they had entered was really Lancaster Sound, so named
by Baffin, and connecting his bay with the western Arctic Ocean.

The same sort of thing occurred again and again in the voyage along this
deeply indented coast, the vessels keeping so far off shore that not
a detail could be made out.

Thus it came about that Cumberland Bay was passed on the 1st October without
any survey of that most important feature of Davis Strait, and Ross
returned to England, having literally turned his back on the glory
awaiting him.

When accused of apathy and neglect of duty, Ross replied with supreme
indifference, "I trust, as I believe myself, that the objects of
the voyage have been in every important point accomplished; that I
have proved the existence of a bay, from Disco to Cumberland Strait,
and set at rest for ever the question of a north-west passage in
this direction."

It would have been impossible to make a more complete mistake. But
fortunately the failure of this expedition did not in the least
discourage other explorers. Some saw in it a brilliant confirmation
of the venerable Baffin's discovery, others looked upon the
innumerable inlets, with their deep waters and strong currents, as
something more than mere bays.

They were straits, and all hope of the discovery of the north-west passage
was not yet lost.

[Illustration: Map of the Arctic Regions.

_Engraved by E. Morieu._]

These suggestions so far weighed with the English Admiralty as to
lead to the equipment of two small vessels, the bomb-vessel _Hecla_
and the brigantine _Griper_, which left the Thames on the 5th May, 1819,
under command of Lieutenant William Parry, whose opinion as to the
existence of the north-west passage had not coincided with that
of his chief.

The vessels reached Lancaster Sound without meeting with any special
adventures, and after a delay of seven days amongst the ice which
encumbered the sea for a distance of eighty miles, they entered the
supposed Bay "shut in by a mountain chain" of John Ross, to find not
only that this mountain chain did not exist, but that the bay was a
strait more than 310 fathoms deep, where the influence of the tide
could be felt. The temperature of the water rose some ten degrees,
and in the course of a single day no less than eighty full-grown
whales were seen.

On the 31st July the explorers landed on the shores of Possession Bay,
visited by them the previous year, and found there their own footprints,
a sign of the small quantity of snow and hoar frost which had fallen
during the winter. All hearts beat high when with a favourable wind and
all sails set the two vessels entered Lancaster Sound.

"It is more easy," says Parry, "to imagine than to describe the almost
breathless anxiety which was now visible in every countenance, while,
as the breeze continued to a fresh gale, we ran quickly up the
sound.
The mast-heads were crowded by the officers and men during the whole
afternoon; and an unconcerned observer, if any could have been
unconcerned on such an occasion, would have been amused by the eagerness
with which the various reports from the crow's-nest were received; all,
however, hitherto favourable to our most sanguine hopes."

The two coasts extended in a parallel line as far as the eye could
reach, that is to say for a distance exceeding fifty miles, and the height
of the waves together with the absence of ice combined to convince the
English that they had reached the open sea by way of the long sought
passage, when an island framed in masses of ice checked their
further progress.

An arm of the sea, however, some twelve leagues wide, opened on the
south, and by it the explorers hoped to find a passage less
encumbered with ice.

Strange to say, as they had advanced in a westerly direction through
Lancaster Sound, the vibrations of the pendulum had increased,
whilst now it appeared to have lost all motion, and "we now therefore
witnessed for the first time the curious phenomenon of the directive
power of the needle becoming so weak as to be completely overcome
by the attraction of the ship; so that the needle might now be
properly said to point to the north pole of the ship."

The arm of the sea widened as the vessels advanced in a westerly direction,
and the shores seemed to bend sensibly towards the south-west, but
after making some 120 miles further progress was again barred by ice.

The explorers therefore returned to Barrow's Strait, of which Lancaster
Sound is but the entry, and once more entered the sea, now free from the
ice, by which it had been encumbered a few days previously.

In W. long. 92 degrees 1 minute 4 seconds was discovered an inlet
called Wellington Channel, about eight leagues wide, entirely free
from ice and apparently not bounded by any land.

The existence of these numerous straits led the explorers to the
conclusion that they were in the midst of a vast archipelago, an opinion
daily receiving fresh confirmation. The dense fogs, however, made
navigation difficult, and the number of little islands and shallows
increased whilst the ice became more compact.

Parry, however, was not to be deterred from pressing on towards the
west, and presently his sailors found, on a large island, to which
the name of Bathurst was given, the remains of some Esquimaux huts
and traces of the former presence of reindeer.

Magnetic observations were now taken, pointing to the conclusion that the
magnetic pole had been passed on the north.

Another large island, that of Melville, soon came in sight, and in
spite of the fogs and ice the expedition succeeded in passing W.
long.
110 degrees, thus earning the reward of 100_l_. sterling promised
by the English Government.

A promontory near Melville Island was named Cape Munificence, whilst a
good harbour close by was called Hecla and Griper Bay.

It was in Winter Harbour at the end of this bay that the vessels
passed the winter.

"Dismantled for the most part," says Parry, "the yards however being
laid for walls and roofed in with thick wadding tilts, they were
sheltered from the snow, whilst stoves and ovens were fixed inside."

Hunting was useless, and resulted in nothing but the frost-biting of the
limbs of some of the hunters, as Melville Island was deserted at
the end of October by all animals except wolves and foxes.

To get through the long winter without dying of ennui was no easy
matter, but the officers hit upon the plan of setting up a theatre,
the first representation in which was given on the 6th November,
the day of the disappearance of the sun for three months.

A special piece was given on Christmas day, in which allusion was
made to the situation of the vessels, and a weekly paper was started
called the _North Georgia Gazette and Winter Chronicle_, which with
Sabine, as editor, run into twenty-one numbers, all printed on the
return to Europe of the expedition.

In January scrofula broke out, and with such virulence as to cause
considerable alarm, but the evil was soon checked by skilful
treatment and the daily distribution of mustard and cress, which
Parry had managed to grow in boxes round his stove.

On the 7th February the sun reappeared, and although many months
must elapse before it would be possible to leave Melville Island,
preparations for a start were at once begun.

On the 30th April the thermometer rose to zero, and the sailors taking
this low temperature for summer wanted to leave off their winter
clothes.

The first ptarmigan appeared on the 12th May, and on the following
day were seen traces of reindeer and of musk goats on their way to
the north; but what caused the greatest delight and surprise to the
crews was the fall of rain on the 24th May.

"We had been so unaccustomed to see water naturally in a fluid state
at all, and much less to see it fall from the heavens, that such
an occurrence became a matter of considerable curiosity, and I
believe every person on board hastened on deck to witness so
interesting as well as novel a phenomenon."

[Illustration: Rain as a novel phenomenon.]

During the first fortnight in June, Parry, accompanied by some of his
officers, made an excursion to the most northerly part of Melville
Island.

On his return, vegetation was everywhere to be seen, the ice was
beginning to melt, and it was evident that a start could soon be
made.

The vessels began to move on the 1st August, but the ice had not yet broken
up in the offing, and they got no further than the eastern extremity
of Melville Island, of which the furthest point reached by Parry
was in N. lat. 113 degrees 46 minutes 13 seconds and W. long. 113
degrees 46 minutes 43 seconds.

The voyage back was unmarked by any special incident, and the expedition
got back to England towards the middle of November.

The results of this voyage were numerous and important.

Not only had a vast extent of the Arctic regions been surveyed; but physical
and magnetic observations had been taken, and many new details collected
on their climate and animal and vegetable life. In fact in a single
trip Parry did more than was accomplished in thirty years by all who
followed in his steps.

Satisfied with the important results obtained by him, the Admiralty
appointed Parry to the command in 1821 of the _Hecla_ and the _Fury_,
the latter built on the model of the former. On this new trip the
explorer surveyed with the greatest care the shores of Hudson's
Bay and the coast of the peninsula of Melville, not to be confounded
with the island of the same name.

At times
it seemed to the minister that they were spending their strength for
naught, and at such times he bitterly grudged, not his own toils, but
those of his wife. None knew better than he how well fitted she was,
both by the native endowments of her mind and by the graces of her
character, to fill the highest sphere, and he sometimes grew impatient
that she should spend herself without stint and reap no adequate reward.

MAURTEEN. That's true--but she's too young to know it's true.

BRIDGET. She's old enough to know that it is wrong To mope and
idle.

MAURTEEN. I've little blame for her; She's dull when my big son is in
the fields, And that and maybe this good woman's tongue Have driven
her to hide among her dreams Like children from the dark under the
bed-clothes.

BRIDGET. She'd never do a turn if I were silent.
MAURTEEN. And maybe it is natural upon May Eve To dream of the good
people."There is not much sign of movement among the dry bones," he said to his
wife. "They are as dry and as dead as ever."

His wife was silent for some time, for she, too, had her moments of
doubt and fear, but she said: "I think there is some sign. The people
were certainly much impressed this morning, and the Bible class was very
large, and they were very attentive."

"So they are every day," said the minister, rather bitterly. "But what
does it amount to? There is not a sign of one of these young people
'coming forward.' Just think, only one young man a member of the church,
and he hasn't got much spunk in him. And many of the older men remain as
hard as the nether millstone."

"I really think," said his wife, "that a number of the young people
would 'come forward' if some one would make a beginning. They are all
very shy."

"So you always say," said her husband, with a touch of impatience;
"but there is no shyness in other things, in their frolics and their
fightings. I am sure this last outrageous business is enough to break
one's heart."

"What do you mean?" said his wife.

"Oh, I suppose you will hear soon enough, so I need not try to keep it
from you. It was Long John Cameron told me. It is strange that Hughie
has not heard. Indeed, perhaps he has, but since his beloved Ranald is
involved, he is keeping it quiet."

"What is it?" said his wife, anxiously.

"Oh, nothing less than a regular pitched battle between the McGregors
and the McRaes of the Sixteenth, and all on Ranald's account, too, I
believe."

Mrs. Murray sat in silent and bitter disappointment. She had expected
much from Ranald. Her husband went on with his tale.

On the other hand, I have heard nothing which would suggest that he had
any active and violent enemies. He was simply the unpopular
boarder--there is always one in every boarding-house--but nothing more.

I have seen a good deal of the man who shared his room--another sea
captain, named Muller. He is a big, silent person, and it is not easy to
get him to talk. As regards the death of Captain Gunner he can tell
me nothing. It seems that on the night of the tragedy he was away at
Portsmouth with some friends. All I have got from him is some information
as to Captain Gunner's habits, which leads nowhere. The dead man
seldom drank, except at night when he would take some whisky. His head
was not strong, and a little of the spirit was enough to make him
semi-intoxicated, when he would be hilarious and often insulting. I
gather that Muller found him a difficult roommate, but he is one
of those placid persons who can put up with anything. He and Gunner
were in the habit of playing draughts together every night in their
room, and Gunner had a harmonica which he played frequently. Apparently,
he was playing it very soon before he died, which is significant, as
seeming to dispose of the idea of suicide.

As I say, I have one or two theories, but they are in a very nebulous
state. The most plausible is that on one of his visits to India--I
have ascertained that he made several voyages there--Captain Gunner
may in some way have fallen foul of the natives. The fact that he
certainly died of the poison of an Indian snake supports this
theory. I am making inquiries as to the movements of several Indian
sailors who were here in their ships at the time of the tragedy.

I have another theory. Does Mrs. Pickett know more about this affair
than she appears to? I may be wrong in my estimate of her mental
qualities. Her apparent stupidity may be cunning.

But here again, the absence of motive brings me up against a dead wall. I
must confess that at present I do not see my way clearly.

However, I will write again shortly."He said something about Maimie, that Don wouldn't tell me, at the
blacksmith shop in the Sixteenth, and Ranald struck him and knocked him
flat, and he could not get up for a long time. Yankee has been showing
him how. I am going to learn, mother," interjected Hughie. "And then
Angus McGregor took Ranald's part, and it was all arranged after church,
and Ranald was bound to be in it, and said he would stop the whole thing
if not allowed. Don said he was just terrible. It was an awful fight.
Angus McGregor fought Peter McRae, Aleck's brother, you know and--"

"Never mind, Hughie," said his mother. "I don't want to hear of it. It
is too disgusting. Was Ranald much hurt?"

"Oh, he was hurt awful bad, and he was going to be licked, too. He
wouldn't keep cool enough, and he wouldn't use his legs."

"Use his legs?" said his mother; "what do you mean?"

"That's what Don says, and Yankee made him. Yankee kept calling to him,
'Now get away, get away from him! Use your legs! Get away from him!' and
whenever Ranald began to do as he was told, then he got the better of
Aleck, and he gave Aleck a terrible hammering, and Don said if Macdonald
Bhain had not stopped them Aleck McRae would not have been able to walk
home. He said Ranald was awful. He said he never saw him like he was
that day. Wasn't it fine, mother?"

"Fine, Hughie!" said his mother. "It is anything but fine. It is simply
disgusting to see men act like beasts. It is very, very sad. I am very
much disappointed in Ranald."

"But, mother, Ranald couldn't help it. And anyway, I am glad he gave
that Aleck McRae a good thrashing. Yankee said he would never be right
until he got it."

"You must not repeat what Yankee says," said his mother. "I am afraid
his influence is not of the best for any of those boys."

"Oh, mother, he didn't set them on," said Hughie, who wanted to be fair
to Yankee. "It was when he could not help it that he told Ranald how to
do. I am glad he did, too."

"I am very, very sorry about it," said his mother, sadly. It was a
greater disappointment to her than she cared to acknowledge either to
her husband or to herself.

But the commotion caused in the community by the fight was soon
swallowed up in the interest aroused by the opening of the new church,
an event for which they had made long and elaborate preparation. The big
bazaar, for which the women had been sewing for a year or more, was held
on Wednesday, and turned out to be a great success, sufficient money
being realized to pay for the church furnishing, which they had
undertaken to provide.

The day following was the first of the "Communion Season." In a Highland
congregation the Communion Seasons are the great occasions of the year.
For weeks before, the congregation is kept in mind of the approaching
event, and on the Thursday of the communion week the season opens with a
solemn fast day.

The annual Fast Day, still a national institution in Scotland, although
it has lost much of its solemnity and sacredness in some places, was
originally associated with the Lord's Supper, and was observed with
great strictness in the matter of eating and drinking; and in Indian
Lands, as in all congregations of that part of the country, the custom
of celebrating the Fast Day was kept up. It was a day of great solemnity
in the homes of the people of a godly sort. There was no cooking of
meals till after "the services," and indeed, some of them tasted
neither meat nor drink the whole day long. To the younger people of the
congregation it was a day of gloom and terror, a kind of day of doom.
Even to those advanced in godliness it brought searchings of heart,
minute and diligent, with agonies of penitence and remorse. It was a
day, in short, in which conscience was invited to take command of the
memory and the imagination to the scourging of the soul for the soul's
good. The sermon for the day was supposed to stimulate and to aid
conscience in this work.

For the communion service Mr. Murray always made it a point to have the
assistance of the best preachers he could procure, and on this occasion,
when the church opening was combined with the sacrament, by a special
effort two preachers had been procured--a famous divine from Huron
County, that stronghold of Calvinism, and a college professor who had
been recently appointed, but who had already gained a reputation as a
doctrinal preacher, and who was, as Peter McRae reported, "grand on the
Attributes and terrible fine on the Law." To him was assigned the honor
of preaching the Fast Day sermon, and of declaring the church "open."

The new church was very different from the old. Instead of the high
crow's nest, with the wonderful sounding-board over it, the pulpit was
simply a raised platform partly inclosed, with the desk in front. There
was no precentor's box, over the loss of which Straight Rory did not
grieve unduly, inasmuch as the singing was to be led, in the English
at least, by John "Aleck." Henceforth the elders would sit with their
families. The elders' seat was gone; Peter McRae's wrath at this being
somewhat appeased by his securing for himself one of the short side
seats at the right of the pulpit, from which he could command a view
of both the minister and the congregation--a position with obvious
advantages. The minister's pew was at the very back of the church.

It was a great assemblage that gathered in the new church to hear the
professor discourse, as doubtless he would, it being the Fast Day, upon
some theme of judgment. After leaving this bay, the corvette reached the
Bay of Mercury; surveyed Barrier Island, entered Shouraki or Hauraki
Bay, identified the Hen and Chickens and the Poor Knights Islands,
finally arriving at the Bay of Islands.

The native tribes met with by D'Urville in this part of the island
were busy with an expedition against those of Shouraki and Waikato Bays.
For the purpose of exploring the former bay, which had been imperfectly
surveyed by Cook, D'Urville sailed back to it, and discovered that
that part of New Zealand is indented with a number of harbours and
gulfs of great depth, each one being safer, if possible, than the
other.

     Having been informed that by following the direction of the Wai
Magoia, a place would be reached distant only a very short journey
from the large port of Manukau, he despatched some of his officers
by that route, and they verified the correctness of the information
he had received.

This discovery, observes Dumont d'Urville, may become of great value
to future settlements of Shouraki Bay; and this value will be still
farther increased should the new surveys prove that the port of
Manukau is accessible to vessels of a certain size, for such a
settlement would command two seas, one on the east and the other
on the west.

One of the "Rangatiras," as the chiefs of that quarter of the island
are called, Rangui by name, had again and again begged the commander
to give him some lead to make bullets with; a request which was
always refused.

Just before setting sail, D'Urville was informed that the deep-sea lead
had been carried off; and he at once reproached Rangui in severe terms,
telling him that such petty larcenies were unworthy of a man in a
respectable position.

The chief appeared to be deeply moved by the reproach, and excused himself
by saying that he had no knowledge of the theft, which must have been
committed by some stranger. "A short time afterwards," the narrative
goes on to say, "my attention was drawn to the side of the ship by
the sound of blows given with great force, and piteous cries proceeding
from the canoe of Rangui. There I saw Rangui and Tawiti striking blow
after blow with their paddles upon an object resembling the figure of a
man covered with a cloak. It was easy to perceive that the two wily
chiefs were simply beating one of the benches of the canoe.

After this farce had been played for some little time, Rangui's paddle
broke in his hands. The sham man was made to appear to fall down,
when Rangui, addressing me, said that he had just killed the thief, and
wished to know whether that would satisfy me. I assured him that it
would, laughing to myself at the artifice of these savages; an artifice,
for that matter, such as is often to be met with among people more
advanced in civilization."
D'Urville next surveyed the lovely island of Wai-hiki, and thus
terminated the survey of the Astrolabe Channel and Hauraki Bay.

He then resumed his voyage in a northerly direction towards the Bay
of Islands, sailing as far as Cape Maria Van Diemen, the most northerly
point of New Zealand, where, say the Waïdonas, "the souls of the
departed gather from all parts of Ika-Na-Mawi, to take their final
flight to the realms of light or to those of eternal darkness."
The Bay of Islands, at the time when the _Coquille_ put in there, was
alive with a pretty considerable population, with whom the visitors soon
became on friendly terms.

Now, however, the animation of former days had given place to the
silence of desolation. The Ipah, or rather the Pah of Kahou Wera,
once the abode of an energetic tribe, was deserted, war had done its
customary destructive work in the place. The Songhui tribe had stolen
the possessions, and dispersed the members of the tribe of Paroa.

The Bay of Islands was the place chosen for their field of effort
by the English missionaries, who, notwithstanding their devotion
to their work had not made any progress among the natives.

The unproductiveness of their labours was only too apparent.

The survey of the eastern side of New Zealand, a hydrographical work of
the utmost importance, terminated at this point.

Since the days of Cook no exploration of anything like such a vast
extent of the coast of this country had been conducted in so careful
a manner, in the face of so many perils. The sciences of geography and
navigation were both signally benefited by the skilful and detailed work
of D'Urville, who had to give proof of exceptional qualities in the
midst of sudden and terrible dangers. However, on his return to
France, no notice was taken of the hardships he had undergone, or the
devotion to duty he had shown; he was left without recognition, and
duties were assigned to him, the performance of which could bring no
distinction, for they could have been equally well discharged by
any ordinary ship's captain.

Leaving New Zealand on the 18th of March, 1827, D'Urville steered
for Tonga Tabou, identified to begin with the islands Curtis, Macaulay,
and Sunday; endeavoured, but without success, to find the island of Vasquez
de Mauzelle, and arrived off Namouka on the 16th of April. Two
days later he made out Eoa; but before reaching Tonga Tabou he encountered
a terrible storm which all but proved fatal to the _Astrolabe_. At Tonga
Tabou he found some Europeans, who had been for many years settled on
the island; from them he received much help in getting to understand
the character of the natives.

The government was in the hands of three chiefs, called _Equis_, who
had shared all authority between them since the banishment of the _Tonï
Tonga_, or spiritual chief, who had enjoyed immense influence. A Wesleyan
mission was in existence at Tonga; but it could be seen at a glance that
the Methodist clergy had not succeeded in acquiring any influence over
the natives. Such converts as had been made were held in general contempt
for their apostasy.

When the _Astrolabe_ had reached the anchorage, after her fortunate
escape from the perils from contrary winds, currents, and rocks, which
had beset her course, she was at once positively overwhelmed with the
offer of an incredible quantity of stores, fruits, vegetables,
fowls, and pigs, which the natives were ready to dispose of for
next to nothing.

For equally low prices D'Urville was able to purchase, for the museum,
specimens of the arms and native productions of the savages.
Amongst them were some clubs, most of them made of casuarina wood,
skilfully carved, or embossed in an artistic manner with mother-of-pearl
or with whalebone.

The custom of amputating a joint or two of the fingers or toes, to
propitiate the Deity, was still observed, in the case of a near relative
being dangerously ill.

From the 28th of April the natives had manifested none but the most
friendly feelings; no single disturbance had occurred; but on the 9th
of May, while D'Urville, with almost all his officers, went to pay a
visit to one of the leading chiefs, named Palou, the reception
accorded to them was marked by a most unusual reserve, altogether
inconsistent with the noisy and enthusiastic demonstrations of the
preceding days.
The distrust evinced by the islanders aroused that of D'Urville, who,
remembering how few were the men left on board the _Astrolabe_, felt
considerable uneasiness. However, nothing unusual happened during
his absence from the ship. But it was only the cowardice of Palou which
had caused the failure of a conspiracy, aiming at nothing less
than the massacre, at one blow, of the whole of the staff, after
which there would have been no difficulty in prevailing over the
crew, who were already more than half-disposed to adopt the easy
mode of life of the islanders.

Such at least was the conclusion the commander came to, and subsequent
events showed that he was right.

These apprehensions determined D'Urville to leave Tonga Tabou as
quickly as possible, and on the 13th every preparation was made to set
sail on the following day. The apprentice Dudemaine was walking about
on the large island, whilst the apprentice Faraquet, with nine
men, was engaged on the small island, Pangaï Modou, in getting
fresh water, or studying the tide, when Tahofa, one of the chiefs,
with several other islanders, then on board the _Astrolabe_, gave
a signal.

The canoes pushed off at once and made for the shore. On trying to discover
the cause of this sudden retreat, it was observed that the sailors
on the island Pangaï Modou were being forcibly dragged off by the
natives.

D'Urville was about to fire off a cannon, when he decided that it
would be safer to send a boat to shore. This boat took off the two
sailors and the apprentice Dudemaine, but was fired upon when despatched
shortly afterwards to set fire to the huts, and to try to capture some
natives as hostages. One native was killed and several others were wounded,
whilst a corporal of the marines received such severe bayonet wounds,
that he died two hours later.

[Illustration: Attack from the natives of Tonga Tabou.]
D'Urville's anxiety about the fate of his sailors, and of Faraquet,
who was in command of them, knew no bounds.

Nothing was left for him to do but to make an attack upon the sacred village
of Mafanga, containing the tombs of several of the principal families.
But on the following day a crowd of natives so skilfully surrounded the
place with embankments and palisades, that it was impossible to
hope to carry it by an attack.

The corvette then drew nearer to the shore, and began to cannonade the
village, without, however, doing any other damage than killing one
of the natives.

At length the difficulty of obtaining provisions, the rain, and the continual
alarm in which the firing of the Frenchmen kept them, induced the islanders
to offer terms of peace.
They gave up the sailors, who had all been very well treated, made a
present of pigs and bananas; and on the 24th of May the _Astrolabe_
took her final departure from the Friendly Islands.

It was quite time indeed that this was done, for D'Urville's situation
was untenable, and in a conversation with his boatswain he ascertained
that not more than half a dozen of the sailors could be relied on;
all the others were ready to go over to the side of the savages.

Tonga Tabou is of madreporic formation, with a thick covering of
vegetable soil, favourable to an abundant growth of shrubs and trees.

The cocoa-tree, the stem of which is slenderer than elsewhere, and the
banana-tree here shoot up with wonderful rapidity and vigour.

The aspect of the land is flat and monotonous, so that a journey of
one or two miles will give as fair an impression of the country as a
complete tour of the island.

The number of the population who have the true Polynesian cast of
countenance may be put down at about 7000.

D'Urville says "they combine the most opposite qualities. They are
generous, courteous, and hospitable, yet avaricious, insolent, and always
thoroughly insincere. The most profuse demonstration of kindness and
friendship may at any moment be interrupted by an act of outrage or
robbery, should their cupidity or their self-respect be ever so
slightly roused."

In intelligence the natives of Tonga are clearly far superior to those
of Otaheite. The French travellers could not sufficiently admire
the astonishing order in which the plantations of yams and bananas were
kept, the excessive neatness of their dwellings, and the beauty of the
garden-plots.

They even knew something of the art of fortification, as D'Urville
ascertained by an inspection of the fortified village of Hifo,
defended with stout palisades, and surrounded by a trench between
fifteen and twenty feet wide, and half filled with water.

On the 25th of May, D'Urville began the exploration of the Viti or Fiji
Archipelago. At the outset he was so fortunate as to fall in with a native
of Tonga who was living on the Fiji Islands for purposes of trade,
and had previously visited Otaheite, New Zealand, and Australia.

This man, as well as a Guam islander, proved most useful to the commander
in furnishing him with the names of more than 200 islands belonging to
this group, and in acquainting him beforehand with their position,
and that of the reefs in their neighbourhood.

At the same time, Gressier, the hydrographer, collected all the
materials requisite for preparing a chart of the Fiji Islands.

At this station a sloop was put under orders to proceed to the island
of Laguemba, where was an anchor which D'Urville would have been well
pleased to obtain, as he had lost two of his own while at Tonga. On
arrival at the island, Lottin, who was in command of the sloop, observed
on the shore none but women and children; armed men, however, soon came
running up, made the women leave the place, and were preparing to seize
the sloop and make the sailors prisoners. Their intentions were too
plain to leave room for any doubt on the subject, so Lottin at
once gave orders to draw up the grapnel, and got away into the open
sea before there was time for an encounter to take place.

During eighteen consecutive days, in the face of bad weather and a rough
sea, the _Astrolabe_ cruised through the Fiji Archipelago, surveyed
the islands of Laguemba, Kandabou, Viti-Levou, Oumbenga Vatou Lele,
Ounong Lebou, Malolo, and many others, giving special attention to
the southern islands of the group, which up to that period had
remained almost entirely unknown.

The population of this group, if we accept D'Urville's account,
form a kind of transition between the copper-coloured, or the
Polynesian, and the black or Melanesian races.

Their strength and vigour are in proportion to their tall figures, and
they make no secret of their cannibal propensities.

On the 11th of June the corvette set sail for the harbour of Carteret;
surveyed one by one the islands of Erronan and Annatom, the Loyalty
Islands, of which group D'Urville discovered the Chabrol and Halgan
Islands, the little group of the Beaupie Islands, the Astrolabe
reefs, all the more dangerous as they are thirty miles distant from
the Beaupie Islands, and sixty from New Caledonia.

The island of Huon, and the chain of reefs to the north of New Caledonia,
were subsequently surveyed. From this point D'Urville reached the Louisiade
Archipelago in six days, but the stormy weather there encountered determined
him to abandon the course he had planned out, and not to pass through
Torres Straits. He thought that an early examination of the southern coast
of New Britain, and of the northern coast of New Guinea, would be the
most conducive to the interests of science.

Rossel Island and Cape Deliverance were next sighted; and the vessel was
steered for New Ireland, with a view to obtaining fresh supplies
of wood and water.

Arriving there on the 5th of July in such gloomy, rainy weather, that
it was with no small difficulty that the entrance of the harbour of
Carteret, where D'Entrecasteaux made a stay of eight days, was made out;
whilst there the travellers received several visits from the score of
natives, who seem to make up the total population of the place. They were
creatures possessed of scarcely any intelligence, and quite destitute
of curiosity about objects that they had not seen before. Neither
did their appearance lead to the slightest prepossession in their favour.
They wore no vestige of clothing; their skin was black and their
hair woolly; and the partition of the nostrils had a sharp bone
thrust through by way of ornament.

     The only object that they showed any eagerness to possess was iron,
but they could not be made to understand that it was only to be
given in exchange for fruits or pigs.

Their expression was one of sullen defiance, and they refused to guide any
one whatever to their village.

     During the unprofitable stay of the corvette in this harbour,
D'Urville had a serious attack of enteritis, from which he suffered
much for several days.

On the 19th July the _Astrolabe_ went to sea again and coasted the
northern side of New Britain, the object of this cruise was frustrated
by rainy and hazy weather.

Continual squalls and heavy showers compelled the vessel to put off
again as soon as it had succeeded in nearing the land. His experience
on this coast D'Urville thus describes:--"One who has not had,
as we have, a practical acquaintance with these seas, is unable
to form any adequate conception of these incredible rains.

Moreover, to obtain a just estimate of the cares and anxieties which
a voyage like ours entails, there must be a liability to the call
of duties similar to those which we had to discharge.

It was very seldom that our horizon lay much beyond the distance of
200 yards, and our observations could not possibly be other than
uncertain, when our own true position was doubtful.

Altogether, the whole of our work upon New Britain, in spite of the
unheard of hardships that fell to our lot and the risks which the
_Astrolabe_ had to run, cannot be put in comparison for a moment,
as respects accuracy, with the other surveys of the expedition."
As it was impracticable to fall back upon the route by the St.

George's Channel, D'Urville had to pass through Dampier's Strait, the
southern entrance to which is all but entirely closed by a chain of
reefs, which were grazed more than once by the _Astrolabe_.

The charming prospect of the western coast of New Britain excited intense
admiration both in Dampier and D'Entrecasteaux; an enthusiasm fully
shared by D'Urville.

A safe roadstead enclosed by land forming a semicircle, forests
whose dark foliage contrasted with the golden colour of the ripening
fields, the whole surmounted by the lofty peaks of Mount Gloucester,
and this variety still further enhanced by the undulating outlines
of Rook Island, are the chief features of the picture here presented
by the coast of New Britain.

[Illustration: Lofty mountains clothed with dense and gloomy forests.]

On issuing from the strait the mountains of New Guinea rose grandly
in the distance; and on a nearer approach they were seen to form a
sort of half-circle shutting in the arm of the sea known as the Bay
of Astrolabe.

The Schouten Islands, the Creek of the Attack (the place where
D'Urville had to withstand an onset of savages), Humboldt Bay, Geelwinck
Bay, the Traitor Islands, Tobie and Mysory, the Arfak Mountains, were
one after another recognized and passed, when the _Astrolabe_ at length
came to an anchor in Port Dorei, in order to connect her operations
with those accomplished by the _Coquille_.

Friendly intercourse was at once established with the Papuans of that
place, who brought on board a number of birds of paradise, but not much
in the shape of provisions. These natives, are of so gentle and timid
a disposition, that only with great reluctance will they risk going into
the woods through fear of the Arfakis, who dwell on the mountains, and
are their sworn enemies.

One of the sailors engaged in getting fresh water was wounded with an arrow
shot by one of these savages, whom it was impossible to punish for a
dastardly outrage prompted by no motive whatever.

The land here is everywhere so fertile that it requires no more than
turning over and weeding, in order to yield the most abundant harvests;
yet the Papuans are so lazy and understand so little of the art of
agriculture, that the growth of food plants is often allowed to be
choked with weeds. The inhabitants belong to several races. D'Urville
divides them into three principal varieties: the Papuans, a mixed
breed, belonging more or less to the Malay or Polynesian race; and
the Harfous or Alfourous, who resemble the common type of Australians;
New Caledonians and the ordinary black Oceanic populations.

These latter would appear to be the true indigenous people of the
country.

On the 6th September the _Astrolabe_ again put to sea, and after an
uninteresting stay at New Guinea, in the course of which scarcely any
specimens of natural history were obtained, except a few mollusca, and
still less exact information regarding the customs, religion, or
language of its diversified population, steered for Amboyna, which was
reached without any accident on the 24th September. The governor, M.
Merkus, happened to be on circuit; but his absence was no obstacle to
the supply of all the stores needed by the commander.

The reception given by the authorities and the society of the place
was of a very cordial kind, and everything was done to compensate the
French explorers for the hardships undergone in their long and troublesome
voyage.

From Amboyna D'Urville proceeded to Hobart Town in Tasmania, a place
not visited by any French vessel since the time of Baudin, arriving on
the 27th December, 1827. Thirty-five years previously D'Entrecasteaux
had met on the shores of this island only a few wretched savages;
and ten years later Baudin found it quite deserted. The first piece
of news that Dumont d'Urville learnt on entering the river Derwent,
before even casting anchor at Hobart Town, was that Captain Dillon,
an Englishman, had received certain information, when at Tucopia,
of the shipwreck of La Pérouse at Vanikoro; and that he had brought
away the hilt of a sword which he believed to have belonged to that
navigator.

On his arrival at Calcutta Dillon communicated his information to the
governor, who without delay despatched him with instructions to rescue
such of the shipwrecked crew as might still be alive, and collect
whatever relics could be found of the vessels.

To D'Urville this intelligence was of the highest interest, seeing
that he had been specially instructed to search for whatever might
be calculated to throw any light upon the fate of the unfortunate
navigator, and he had while at Namouka obtained proof of the residence
for a time of La Pérouse at the Friendly Islands.

In the English colony itself there was some difference of opinion as
to the credit which Captain Dillon's story was entitled to receive;
but the report which that officer had made to the Governor-General of
India, quite removed any doubt from the mind of D'Urville.

Abandoning, therefore, all further plans with reference to New Zealand,
he decided upon proceeding at once in the _Astrolabe_, in the track
of Dillon, to Vanikoro, which he then knew only by the name of
Mallicolo.

[Illustration: Natives of Vanikoro. (Fac-simile of early engraving.)]

The following is the statement of the circumstances as made by
Dillon.

During a stay made by the ship _Hunter_ at the Fiji Islands, three
persons, a Prussian named Martin Bushart, his wife, and a Lascar,
called Achowlia, were received on board, endeavouring to escape
from the horrible fate awaiting them, which had already befallen
the other European deserters settled in that archipelago, that of
being devoured by the savages; this unhappy trio merely begged to
be put on shore at the first inhabited island which the _Hunter_
might touch at.

Accordingly, they were left on one of the Charlotte Islands, Tucopia,
in 12 degrees 15 minutes S. lat, and 169 degrees W. long. In the month
of May, 1836, Dillon, who had been one of the crew of the ship
_Hunter_, paid a visit to the island of Tucopia, with a view of
ascertaining what had become of the people put on shore in 1813.

There he found the Lascar and the Prussian; the former of whom sold
him a silver sword-hilt.

As might have been expected, Dillon was curious to know how the natives
of that island had come into possession of such an article. The Prussian
then related that on his arrival at Tucopia he had found many
articles of iron, such as bolts, axes, knives, spoons, and other
things, which he was told had come from Mallicolo, a group of islands
situated about two days canoe sail to the east of Tucopia. By further
interrogatories, Dillon learnt that two vessels had been thrown upon
the coasts many years previously, one of which had perished entirely
with all on board, whilst the crew of the second had constructed out of
the wreck of their ship a little boat, in which they had put to sea,
leaving some of their number at Mallicolo.
And then Ranald fairly faced the fact that before long he would be alone
in the world. Without any exchange of words, he and his father came to
understand each other, and they both knew that they were spending
their last days on earth together. On the son's side, they were days of
deepening sorrow; but with the father, every day seemed to bring him
a greater peace of mind and a clearer shining of the light that never
fades. To his son, Macdonald Dubh never spoke of the death that he felt
to be drawing nearer, but he often spoke to him of the life he would
like his son to live. His only other confidant in these matters was the
minister's wife. To her Macdonald Dubh opened up his heart, and to her,
more than to any one else, he owed his growing peace and light; and it
was touching to see the devotion and the tenderness that he showed to
her as often as she came to see him. With his brother, Macdonald Bhain,
he made all the arrangements necessary for the disposal of the farm and
the payment of the mortgage.

Ranald had no desire to be a farmer, and indeed, when the mortgage was
paid there would not be much left.

"He will be my son," said Macdonald Bhain to his brother; "and my home
will be his while I live."

So in every way there was quiet preparation for Macdonald Dubh's going,
and when at last the day came, there was no haste or fear.

It was in the afternoon of a bright September day, as the sun was
nearing the tops of the pine-trees in the west. His brother was
supporting him in his strong arms, while Ranald knelt by the bedside.
Near him sat the minister's wife, and at a little distance Kirsty.

"Lift me up, Tonal," said the dying man; "I will be wanting to see the
sun again, and then I will be going. I will be going to the land where
they will not need the light of the sun. Tonal, bhodaich, it is the
good brother you have been to me, and many's the good day we have had
together."

"Och, Hugh, man. Are you going from me?" said Macdonald Bhain, with
great sorrow in his voice.

"Aye, Tonal, for a little." Then he looked for a few moments at Kirsty,
who was standing at the foot of the bed.

"Come near me, Kirsty," he said; and Kirsty came to the bedside.

"You have always been kind to me and mine, and you were kind to HER as
well, and the reward will come to you." Then he turned to Mrs. Murray,
and said, with a great light of joy in his eyes: "It is you that came to
me as the angel of God with a word of salvation, and forever more I will
be blessing you." And then he added, in a voice full of tenderness,
"I will be telling her about you." He took Mrs. Murray's hand and
tremblingly lifted it to his lips.

"It has been a great joy to me," said Mrs. Murray, with difficulty
steadying her voice, "to see you come to your Saviour, Mr. Macdonald."

"Aye, I know it well," he said; and then he added, in a voice that sank
almost to a whisper, "Now you will be reading the prayer." And Mrs.
Murray, opening her Gaelic Bible, repeated in her clear, soft voice, the
words of the Lord's Prayer. Through all the petitions he followed her,
until he came to the words, "Forgive us our debts." There he paused.

"Ranald, my man," he said, raising his hand with difficulty and laying
it upon the boy's head, "you will listen to me now. Some day you will
find the man that brought me to this, and you will say to him that your
father forgave him freely, and wished him all the blessing of God. You
will promise me this, Ranald?" said Macdonald Dubh.

"Yes, father," said Ranald, lifting his head, and looking into his
father's face.

"And, Ranald, you, too, will be forgiving him?" But to this there was no
reply. Ranald's head was buried in the bed.

"Ah," said Macdonald Dubh, with difficulty, "you are your father's son;
but you will not be laying this bitterness upon me now. You will be
forgiving him, Ranald?"

"Oh, father!" cried Ranald, with a breaking voice, "how can I forgive
him? How can I forgive the man who has taken you away from me?"

"It is no man," replied his father, "but the Lord himself; the Lord who
has forgiven your father much. I am waiting to hear you, Ranald."

Then, with a great sob, Ranald broke forth: "Oh, father, I will forgive
him," and immediately became quiet, and so continued to the end.

After some moments of silence, Macdonald Dubh looked once more toward
the minister's wife, and a radiant smile spread over his face.

"You will be finishing," he said.

Her face was wet with tears, and for a few moments she could not speak.
But it was no time to fail in duty, so, commanding her tears, with a
clear, unwavering voice she went on to the end of the prayer--

"For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever and ever.
Amen."

"Glory!" said Macdonald Dubh after her. "Aye, the Glory. Ranald, my boy,
where are you? You will be following me, lad, to the Glory. SHE will be
asking me about you. You will be following me, lad?"

The anxious note in his voice struck Ranald to the heart.

"Oh, father, it is what I want," he replied, brokenly. "I will try."

"Aye," said Macdonald Dubh, "and you will come. I will be telling HER.
Now lay me down, Tonal; I will be going."

Macdonald Bhain laid him quietly back on his pillow, and for a moment he
lay with his eyes closed.

Once more he opened his eyes, and with a troubled look upon his face,
and in a voice of doubt and fear, he cried: "It is a sinful man, O Lord,
a sinful man."

His eyes wandered till they fell on Mrs. Murray's face, and then the
trouble and fear passed out of them, and in a gentler voice he said:
"Forgive us our debts." Then, feeling with his hand till it rested on
his son's head, Macdonald Dubh passed away, at peace with men and with
God.

There was little sadness and no bitter grief at Macdonald Dubh's
funeral. The tone all through was one of triumph, for they all knew his
life, and how sore the fight had been, and how he had won his victory.
His humility and his gentleness during the last few weeks of his life
had removed all the distance that had separated him from the people,
and had drawn their hearts toward him; and now in his final triumph they
could not find it in their hearts to mourn.

But to Ranald the sadness was more than the triumph. Through the wild,
ungoverned years of his boyhood his father had been more than a father
to him. He had been a friend, sharing a common lot, and without much
show of tenderness, understanding and sympathizing with him, and now
that his father had gone from him, a great loneliness fell upon the lad.

The farm and its belongings were sold. Kirsty brought with her the big
box of blankets and linen that had belonged to Ranald's mother. Ranald
took his mother's Gaelic Bible, his father's gun and ax, and with the
great deerhound, Bugle, and his colt, Lisette, left the home of his
childhood behind him, and with his Aunt Kirsty, went to live with his
uncle.

Throughout the autumn months he was busy helping his uncle with the
plowing, the potatoes, and the fall work. Soon the air began to nip,
and the night's frost to last throughout the shortening day, and then
Macdonald Bhain began to prepare wood for the winter, and to make all
things snug about the house and barn; and when the first fall of snow
fell softly, he took down his broad-ax, and then Ranald knew that the
gang would soon be off again for the shanties. That night his uncle
talked long with him about his future.

"I have no son, Ranald," he said, as they sat talking; "and, for your
father's sake and for your own, it is my desire that you should become
a son to me, and there is no one but yourself to whom the farm would go.
And glad will I be if you will stay with me. But, stay or not, all that
I have will be yours, if it please the Lord to spare you."

"I would want nothing better," said Ranald, "than to stay with you and
work with you, but I do not draw toward the farm."

"And what else would you do, Ranald?"

"Indeed, I know not," said Ranald, "but something else than farming. But
meantime I should like to go to the shanties with you this winter."

And so, when the Macdonald gang went to the woods that winter, Ranald,
taking his father's ax, went with them. And so clever did the boy prove
himself that by the time they brought down their raft in the spring
there was not a man in all the gang that Macdonald Bhain would sooner
have at his back in a tight place than his nephew Ranald. And, indeed,
those months in the woods made a man out of the long, lanky boy, so
that, on the first Sabbath after the shantymen came home, not many in
the church that day would have recognized the dark-faced, stalwart youth
had it not been that he sat in the pew beside Macdonald Bhain. It was
with no small difficulty that the minister's wife could keep her little
boy quiet in the back seat, so full of pride and joy was he at the
appearance of his hero; but after the service was over, Hughie could
be no longer restrained. Pushing his way eagerly through the crowd, he
seized upon Ranald and dragged him to his mother.

"Here he is, mother!" he exclaimed, to Ranald's great confusion, and to
the amusement of all about him. "Isn't he splendid?"

And as Ranald greeted Mrs. Murray with quiet, grave courtesy, she felt
that his winter in the woods and on the river had forever put behind him
his boyhood, and that henceforth he would take his place among the men.
And looking at his strong, composed, grave face, she felt that that
place ought not to be an unworthy one.


CHAPTER XVII

LENOIR'S NEW MASTER


The shantymen came back home to find the revival still going on. Not a
home but had felt its mighty power, and not a man, woman, or even child
but had come more or less under its influence. Indeed, so universal
was that power that Yankee was heard to say, "The boys wouldn't go in
swimmin' without their New Testaments"--not but that Yankee was in very
fullest sympathy with the movement. He was regular in his attendance
upon the meetings all through spring and summer, but his whole previous
history made it difficult for him to fully appreciate the intensity and
depth of the religious feeling that was everywhere throbbing through the
community.

"Don't see what the excitement's for," he said to Macdonald Bhain one
night after meeting. "Seems to me the Almighty just wants a feller to do
the right thing by his neighbor and not be too independent, but go 'long
kind o' humble like and keep clean. Somethin' wrong with me, perhaps,
but I don't seem to be able to work up no excitement about it. I'd like
to, but somehow it ain't in me."

When Macdonald Bhain reported this difficulty of Yankee's to Mrs.
Murray, she only said: "'What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?'" And with
this Macdonald Bhain was content, and when he told Yankee, the latter
came as near to excitement as he ever allowed himself. He chewed
vigorously for a few moments, then, slapping his thigh, he exclaimed:
"By jings! That's great. She's all right, ain't she? We ain't all built
the same way, but I'm blamed if I don't like her model."

But the shantymen noticed that the revival had swept into the church,
during the winter months, a great company of the young people of the
congregation; and of these, a band of some ten or twelve young men, with
Don among them, were attending daily a special class carried on in the
vestry of the church for those who desired to enter training for the
ministry.

Mrs. Murray urged Ranald to join this class, for, even though he had no
intention of becoming a minister, still the study would be good for him,
and would help him in his after career. She remembered how Ranald had
told her that he had no intention of being a farmer or lumberman. And
Ranald gladly listened to her, and threw himself into his study, using
his spare hours to such good purpose throughout the summer that he
easily kept pace with the class in English, and distanced them in his
favorite subject, mathematics.

But all these months Mrs. Murray felt that Ranald was carrying with him
a load of unrest, and she waited for the time when he would come to her.
His uncle, Macdonald Bhain, too, shared her anxiety in regard to Ranald.

"He is the fine, steady lad," he said one night, walking home with her
from the church; "and a good winter's work has he put behind him. He is
that queeck, there is not a man like him on the drive; but he is not the
same boy that he was. He will not be telling me anything, but when the
boys will be sporting, he is not with them. He will be reading his book,
or he will be sitting by himself alone. He is like his father in the
courage of him. There is no kind of water he will not face, and no man
on the river would put fear on him. And the strength of him! His arms
are like steel. But," returning to his anxiety, "there is something
wrong with him. He is not at peace with himself, and I wish you could
get speech with him."

"I would like it, too," replied Mrs. Murray. "Perhaps he will come to
me. At any rate, I must wait for that."

At last, when the summer was over, and the harvest all gathered in, the
days were once more shortening for the fall, Ranald drove Lisette one
day to the manse, and went straight to the minister's wife and opened up
his mind to her.

"I cannot keep my promise to my father, Mrs. Murray," he said, going
at once to the heart of his trouble. "I cannot keep the anger out of my
heart. I cannot forgive the man that killed my father. I will be waking
at night with the very joy of feeling my fingers on his throat, and I
feel myself longing for the day when I will meet him face to face and
nothing between us. But," he added, "I promised my father, and I
must keep my word, and that is what I cannot do, for the feeling of
forgiveness is not here," smiting his breast. "I can keep my hands off
him, but the feeling I cannot help."

For a long time Mrs. Murray let him go on without seeking to check the
hot flow of his words and without a word of reproof. Then, when he had
talked himself to silence, she took her Bible and read to him of the
servant who, though forgiven, took his fellow-servant by the throat,
refusing to forgive. And then she turned over the leaves and read once
more: "'God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet
sinners, Christ died for us.'"

She closed the book and sat silent, waiting for Ranald to speak.

"I know," he said, deliberately; "I have read that often through the
winter, but it does not help the feeling I have. I think it only makes
it worse. There is some one holding my arm, and I want to strike."

"And do you forget," said Mrs. Murray, and her voice was almost stern,
"and do you forget how, for you, God gave His Son to die?"

Ranald shook his head. "I am far from forgetting that."

"And are you forgetting the great mercy of God to your father?"

"No, no," said Ranald; "I often think of that. But when I think of that
man, something stirs within me and I cannot see, for the daze before
my eyes, and I know that some day I will be at him. I cannot help my
feeling."

"Ranald," said Mrs. Murray, "have you ever thought how he will need
God's mercy like yourself? And have you never thought that perhaps he
has never had the way of God's mercy put before him? To you the Lord has
given much, to him little. It is a terrible thing to be ungrateful for
the mercy of God; and it is a shameful thing. It is unworthy of any true
man. How can any one take the fullness of God's mercy and his patience
every day, and hold an ungrateful heart?"

She did not spare him, and as Ranald sat and listened, his life and
character began to appear to him small and mean and unworthy.

"The Lord means you to be a noble man, Ranald--a man with the heart and
purpose to do some good in the world, to be a blessing to his fellows;
and it is a poor thing to be so filled up with selfishness as to have no
thought of the honor of God or of the good of men. Louis LeNoir has done
you a great wrong, but what is that wrong compared with the wrong you
have done to Him who loved you to His own death?"

Then she gave him her last word: "When you see Louis LeNoir, think of
God's mercy, and remember you are to do him good and not evil."

And with that word in his heart, Ranald went away, ashamed and humbled,
but not forgiving. The time for that had not yet come. But before he
left for the shanties, he saw Mrs. Murray again to say good by. He met
her with a shamed face, fearing that she must feel nothing but contempt
for him.

"You will think ill of me," he said, and in spite of his self-control
his voice shook. "I could not bear that."

"No, I could never think ill of you, Ranald, but I would be grieved to
think that you should fail of becoming a noble man, strong and brave;
strong enough to forgive and brave enough to serve."

Once more Ranald went to the woods, with earnest thoughts in his
mind, hoping he should not meet LeNoir, and fighting out his battle
to victory; and by the time the drive had reached the big water next
spring, that battle was almost over. The days in the silent woods and
the nights spent with his uncle in the camp, and afterward in his cabin
on the raft, did their work with Ranald.

The timber cut that year was the largest that had ever been known on the
Upper Ottawa. There was great crowding of rafts on the drive, and for
weeks the chutes were full, and when the rafts were all brought together
at Quebec, not only were the shores lined and Timber Cove packed, but
the broad river was full from Quebec to Levis, except for the steamboat
way which must be kept open.

For the firm of Raymond & St. Clair this meant enormous increase of
business, and it was no small annoyance that at this crisis they should
have detected their Quebec agent in fraud, and should have been forced
to dismiss him. The situation was so critical that Mr. St. Clair
himself, with Harry as his clerk, found it necessary to spend a month in
Quebec. He took with him Maimie and her great friend Kate Raymond, the
daughter of his partner, and established himself in the Hotel Cheval
Blanc.

On the whole, Maimie was not sorry to visit the ancient capital of
Canada, though she would have chosen another time. It was rather
disappointing to leave her own city in the West, just at the beginning
of the spring gayeties. It was her first season, and the winter had been
distinguished by a series of social triumphs. She was the toast of all
the clubs and the belle of all the balls. She had developed a rare and
fascinating beauty, and had acquired an air so distingue that even her
aunt, Miss St. Clair, was completely satisfied. It was a little hard for
her to leave the scene of her triumphs and to abandon the approaching
gayeties.

But Quebec had its compensations, and then there were the De Lacys, one
of the oldest English families of Quebec. The St. Clairs had known them
for many years. Their blood was unquestionably blue, they were wealthy,
and besides, the only son and representative of the family was now
lieutenant, attached to the garrison at the Citadel. Lieutenant De
Lacy suggested possibilities to Maimie. Quebec might be endurable for a
month.

"What a lovely view, and how picturesque!"

Maimie was standing at the window looking down upon the river with its
fleet of rafts. Beside her stood Kate, and at another window Harry.

"What a lot of timber!" said Harry. "And the town is just full of
lumbermen. A fellow said there must be six thousand of them, so there
will be lots of fun."

"Fun!" exclaimed Kate.

"Fun! rather. These fellows have been up in the woods for some five
or six months, and when they get to town where there is whisky
and--and--that sort of thing, they just get wild. They say it is awful."

"Just horrible!" said Maimie, in a disgusted tone.

"But splendid," said Kate; "that is, if they don't hurt any one."

"Hurt anybody!" exclaimed Harry. "Oh, not at all; they are always
extremely careful not to hurt any one. They are as gentle as lambs.
I say, let us go down to the river and look at the rafts. De Lacy was
coming up, but it is too late now for him. Besides, we might run across
Maimie's man from Glengarry."

"Maimie's man from Glengarry!" exclaimed Kate. "Has she a man there,
too?"

"Nonsense, Kate!" said Maimie, blushing. "He is talking about Ranald,
you know. One of Aunt Murray's young men, up in Glengarry. You have
heard me speak of him often."

"Oh, the boy that pulled you out of the fire," said Kate.

"Yes," cried Harry, striking an attitude, "and the boy that for love of
her entered the lists, and in a fistic tournament upheld her fair name,
and--"

"Oh, Harry, do have some sense!" said Maimie, impatiently. "Hush, here
comes some one; Lieutenant De Lacy, I suppose."

It was the lieutenant, handsome, tall, well made, with a high-bred
if somewhat dissipated face, an air of blase indifference a little
overdone, and an accent which he had brought back with him from Oxford,
and which he was anxious not to lose. Indeed, the bare thought of the
possibility of his dropping into the flat, semi-nasal of his native land
filled the lieutenant with unspeakable horror.

"We were just going down to the river," said Maimie, after the
introductions were over, "but I suppose it is all old to you, and you
would not care to go?"

"Aw, charmed, I'm sure." (The lieutenant pronounced it "shuah.") "But it
is rathaw, don't you know, not exactly clean."

"He is thinking of his boots," said Harry, scornfully, looking down at
the lieutenant's shining patent leathers.

"Really," said the lieutenant, mildly, "awfully dirty street, though."

"But we want to see the shantymen," said Kate, frankly.

"Oh, the men! Very proper, but not so very discriminating, you know."

"I love the shantymen," exclaimed Kate, enthusiastically. "Maimie told
me all about them."

"By Jove! I'll join to-morrow," exclaimed the lieutenant with gentle
excitement.

"They would not have you," answered Kate. "Besides, you would have to
eat pork and onions and things."

The lieutenant shuddered, gazing reproachfully at Kate.

"Onions!" he gasped; "and you love them?"

"Let us go along, then," said Harry. "We will have a look at them,
anyway."

"From the windward side, I hope," said the lieutenant, gently.

"I am going right on the raft," declared Kate, stoutly, "if we can only
find Ranald."

"Meaning who, exactly?" questioned De Lacy.

"A lumberman whom Maimie adores."

"How happy!" said De Lacy.

"Nonsense, Lieutenant De Lacy," said Maimie, impatiently and a little
haughtily; "he is a friend of my aunt's up in the county of Glengarry."

"No nonsense about it," said Harry, indignant that his sister should
seem indifferent to Ranald. "He is a great friend of us all; and you
will see--she will fly into his arms."

"Heaven forbid!" ejaculated the lieutenant, much shocked.

"Harry, how can you be so--?" said Maimie, much annoyed. "What will the
lieutenant think of me?"

"Ah, if I only might tell!" said the lieutenant, looking at her with
languishing eyes. But already Kate was downstairs and on her way to the
street.

As they neared the lower town, the narrow streets became more and more
crowded with men in the shantymen's picturesque dress, and they had some
difficulty in making their way through the jolly, jostling crowds. As
they were nearing the river, they saw coming along the narrow sidewalk
a burly French-Canadian, dressed in the gayest holiday garb of the
shantymen.--red shirt and sash, corduroys tucked into red top-boots, a
little round soft hat set upon the back of his black curls, a gorgeous
silk handkerchief around his neck, and a big gold watch-chain with
seals at his belt. He had a bold, handsome face, and swaggered along the
sidewalk, claiming it all with an assurance fortified by whisky enough
to make him utterly regardless of any but his own rights.

"Hello!" he shouted, as he swaggered along. "Make way, I'm de boss bully
on de reever Hottawa." It was his day of glory, and it evidently pleased
him much that the people stood aside to let him pass. Then he broke into
song:--


     "En roulant ma boule roulant,
        En roulant me boule."


"This, I suppose, is one of your beloved shantymen," said the
lieutenant, turning to Kate, who was walking with Harry behind.

"Isn't he lovely!" exclaimed Kate.

"Oh," cried Maimie, in terror, "let us get into a shop!"

"Quite unnecessary, I assure you," said the lieutenant, indifferently;
"I have not the least idea that he will molest you."

The lumberman by this time had swaggered up to the party, expecting them
to make way, but instead, De Lacy stiffened his shoulder, caught the
Frenchman in the chest, and rolled him off into the street. Surprised
and enraged, the Frenchman turned to demolish the man who had dared to
insult the "boss bully on de reever Hottawa."

"Vous n'avez pas remarque la demoiselle," said the lieutenant, in a tone
of politeness.

The lumberman, who had swaggered up ready to strike, glanced at Maimie,
took off his hat, and made a ceremonious bow.

"Eh bien! Non! Pardon, Mams'elle."

"Bon jour," said Lieutenant De Lacy, with a military salute, and moved
on, leaving the lumberman staring after them as if he had seen a vision.

"Beauty and the Beast," murmured the lieutenant. "Thought I was in for
it, sure. Really wonderful, don't you know!"

"Do you think we had better go on?" said Maimie, turning to Kate and
Harry.

"Why not? Why, certainly!" they exclaimed.

"These horrid men," replied Maimie.

"Dear creatures!" said the lieutenant, glancing at Kate with a mildly
pathetic look. "Sweet, but not always fragrant."

"Oh, they won't hurt us. Let us go on."

"Certainly, go on," echoed Harry, impatiently.

"Safe enough, Miss St. Clair, but," pulling out his perfumed
handkerchief, "rather trying."

"Oh, get on, De Lacy," cried Harry, and so they moved on.

The office of Raymond & St. Clair stood near the wharves. Harry paused
at the door, not quite sure whether to go in or not. It was easy to
discover work in that office.

"You might ask if Ranald has come," said Kate. "Maimie is too shy."

Harry returned in a few moments, quite excited.

"The Macdonald gang are in, and the Big Macdonald was here not half an
hour ago, and Ranald is down at the raft beyond the last wharf. I know
the place."

"Oh, do let us go on!" cried Kate, to whom Harry had been extolling
Ranald on the way down. "You really ought to inspect your timber, Harry,
shouldn't you?"

"Most certainly, and right away. No saying what might happen."

"Awful slush," said the lieutenant, glancing at Maimie's face. "Do you
think the timber wouldn't keep for a week?"

"Oh, rubbish! A week!" cried Harry. "He is thinking of his boots again."

To be quite fair to the lieutenant, it was Maimie's doubtful face,
rather than his shiny boots, that made him hesitate. She was evidently
nervous and embarrassed. The gay, easy manner which was her habit was
gone.

"I think perhaps we had better go, since we are here," she said,
doubtfully.

"Exactly; it is what I most desired," said the lieutenant, gallantly.

Scores of rafts lay moored along the wharves and shore, and hundred
of lumbermen were to be seen everywhere, not only on the timber and
wharves, but crowding the streets and the doors of the little saloons.

For half an hour they walked along, watching the men at work with the
timber on the river. Some were loading the vessels lying at anchor, some
were shifting the loose timber about. When they reached the end of the
last wharf, they saw a strapping young lumberman, in a shanty costume
that showed signs of the woods, running some loose sticks of timber
round the end of the raft. With great skill he was handling his pike,
walking the big sticks and running lightly over the timber too small to
carry him, balancing himself on a single stick while he moved the timber
to the bit of open water behind the raft, and all with a grace and
dexterity that excited Kate's admiration to the highest degree.

"Rather clever, that," said the lieutenant, lazily. "Hello! close call,
that; ha! bravo!" It was not often the lieutenant allowed himself the
luxury of excitement, but the lumberman running his timber slipped his
pike pole and found himself balancing on the edge of open water. With a
mighty spring he cleared the open space, touched a piece of small timber
that sank under him, and at the next spring landed safe on the raft.
Maimie's scream sounded with the lieutenant's "bravo." At the cry the
young fellow looked up. It was Ranald.

"Hello, there!" cried Harry; and with an answering shout, Ranald, using
his pike as a jumping-pole, cleared the open space, ran lightly over the
floating sticks, and with another spring reached the shore. Without a
moment's hesitation he dropped his pole and came almost running toward
them, his face radiant with delight.

"Maimie!" he exclaimed, holding out his hand, wet and none too clean.

"How do you do?" said Maimie. She had noticed the look of surprise and
mild disgust on the lieutenant's face, and she was embarrassed. Ranald
was certainly not lovely to look at. His shirt was open at the neck,
torn, and dirty. His trousers and boots were much the worse of their
struggle with the bush.

"This is Mr. Macdonald, Lieutenant De Lacy," Maimie hurried to say. The
lieutenant offered a limp hand.

"Chawmed, I'm suah," he murmured.

"What?" said Ranald.

"Lovely weather," murmured the lieutenant again, looking at his fingers
that Ranald had just let go.

"Well, old chap," said Harry, grasping Ranald's hand and throwing his
arm about his shoulder, "I am awfully glad to find you. We have
been hunting you for half an hour. But hold up, here you are. Let me
introduce you to Miss Kate Raymond, the best girl anywhere."

Kate came forward with a frank smile. "I am very glad to meet you,"
she said. "I have heard so much about you, and I am going to call you
Ranald, as they all do."

"How lovely!" sighed De Lacy.

Her greeting warmed Ranald's heart that somehow had been chilled in
the meeting. Something was wrong. Was it this fop of a soldier, or had
Maimie changed? Ranald glanced at her face. No, she was the same, only
more beautiful than he had dreamed.

But while she was shaking hands with him, there flashed across his mind
the memory of the first time he had seen her, and the look of amusement
upon her face then, that had given him such deadly offense. There was
no amusement now, but there was embarrassment and something else. Ranald
could not define it, but it chilled his heart, and at once he began to
feel how badly dressed he was. The torn shirt, the ragged trousers, and
the old, unshapely boots that he had never given a thought to before,
now seemed to burn into his flesh. Unconsciously he backed away and
turned to go.

"Where are you off to?" cried Harry; "do you think we are going to let
you go now? We had hard enough work finding you. Come up to the office
and see the governor. He wants to see you badly."

Ranald glanced at the lieutenant, immaculate except where the slush had
speckled his shiny boots, and then at his own ragged attire. "I think I
will not go up now," he said.

"Well, come up soon," said Maimie, evidently relieved.

"No!" said Kate, impetuously, "come right along now." As she spoke she
ranged herself beside him.

For a moment or two Ranald hesitated, shot a searching glance at
Maimie's face, and then, with a reckless laugh, said, "I will go now,"
and set off forthwith, Kate proudly marching at one side, and Harry on
the other, leaving Maimie and the lieutenant to follow after.

And a good thing it was for Ranald that he did go that day with Harry to
his "governor's" office. They found the office in a "swither," as Harry
said, over the revelations of fraud that were coming to light every
day--book-keeper, clerk, and timber-checker having all been in
conspiracy to defraud the company.

"Where have you been, Harry?" said his father in an annoyed tone as his
son entered the office. "You don't seem to realize how much there is to
do just now."

"Looking up Ranald, father," said Harry, cheerfully.

"Ah, the young man from Glengarry?" said Mr. St. Clair, rising. "I am
glad to know you, and to thank you in person for your prompt courage in
saving my daughter."

"Lucky dog!" groaned the lieutenant, in an undertone to Maimie.

Mr. St. Clair spoke to Ranald of his father and his uncle in words of
highest appreciation, and as Ranald listened, the reckless and hard look
which had been gathering ever since his meeting with Maimie passed away,
and his face became earnest and touched with a tender pride.

"I hear about you frequently from my sister, Mr. Macdonald--or shall
I say Ranald?" said Mr. St. Clair, kindly. "She apparently thinks
something of you."

Pickett, explained who very little intelligence and requested am, to
said me".

She is I, of good silent a familiar, who to furnish impressed me
said as wonderful having me any further information which might be

."What a shame not to
have asked before!"

"She was very well last fall," said Ranald, looking keenly into Maimie's
face; "but she is working too hard at the meetings."

"Meetings!" exclaimed Harry.

"Aye, for a year and more she has been at them every night till late."

"At meetings for a year! What meetings?" cried Harry, astonished.

"Oh, Harry, you know about the great revival going on quite well," said
Maimie.

"Oh, yes. I forgot. What a shame! What is the use of her killing herself
that way?"

"There is much use," said Ranald, gravely. "They are making bad men
good, and the whole countryside is new, and she is the heart of it all."

"I have no doubt about that," said Mr. St. Clair. "She will be the head
and heart and hands and feet."

"You're just right, governor," said Harry, warmly. "There is no woman
living like Aunt Murray."

There was silence for a few moments. Then Mr. St. Clair said suddenly:
"We are in an awful fix here. Not a man to be found that we can depend
upon for book-keeper, clerk, or checker."

Harry coughed slightly.

"Oh, of course, Harry is an excellent book-keeper," Harry bowed low;
"while he is at it," added Mr. St. Clair.

"Very neat one," murmured the lieutenant.

"Now, father, do not spoil a fine compliment in that way," cried Harry.

"But now the checker is gone," said Mr. St. Clair, "and that is
extremely awkward."

"I say," cried Harry, "what will you give me for a checker right now?"

Mr. St. Clair looked at him and then at the lieutenant.

"Pardon me, Mr. St. Clair," said that gentleman, holding up his hand. "I
used to check a little at Rugby, but--"

"Not you, by a long hand," interrupted Harry, disdainfully.

"This awfully charming brother of yours, so very frank, don't you know!"
said the lieutenant, softly, to Maimie, while they all laughed.

"But here is your man, governor," said Harry, laying his hand on Ranald.

"Ranald!" exclaimed Mr. St. Clair. "Why, the very man! You understand
timber, and you are honest."

"I will answer for both with my head," said Harry.

"What do you say, Ranald?" said Mr. St. Clair. "Will you take a day to
think it over?"

"No," said Ranald; "I will be your checker." And so Ranald became part
of the firm of Raymond & St. Clair.

"Come along, Ranald," said Harry. "We will take the girls home, and then
come back to the office."

"Yes, do come," said Kate, heartily. Maimie said nothing.

"No," said Ranald; "I will go back to the raft first, and then come to
the office. Shall I begin tonight?" he said to Mr. St. Clair.

"To-morrow morning will do, Ranald," said Mr. St. Clair. "Come up to the
hotel and see us tonight." But Ranald said nothing. Then Maimie went up
to him.

"Good by, just now," she said, smiling into his face. "You will come and
see us to-night, perhaps?"

Ranald looked at her, while the blood mounted slowly into his dark
cheek, and said: "Yes, I will come."

"What's the matter with you, Maimie?" said Harry, indignantly, when they
had got outside. "You would think Ranald was a stranger, the way you
treat him."

"And he is just splendid! I wish he had pulled ME out of the fire,"
cried Kate.

"You might try the river," said the lieutenant. "I fancy he would go in.
Looks that sort."

"Go in?" cried Harry, "he would go anywhere." The lieutenant made no
reply. He evidently considered that it was hardly worth the effort to
interest himself in the young lumberman, but before he was many hours
older he found reason to change his mind.

After taking the young ladies to their hotel there was still an hour
till the lieutenant's dinner, so, having resolved to cultivate the St.
Clair family, he proposed accompanying Harry back to the office.

As they approached the lower portion of the town they heard wild shouts,
and sauntering down a side street, they came upon their French-Canadian
friend of the afternoon. He was standing with his back against a wall
trying to beat off three or four men, who were savagely striking and
kicking at him, and crying the while: "Gatineau! Gatineau!"

It was the Gatineau against the Ottawa.

"Our friend seems to have found the object of his search," said the
lieutenant, as he stood across the street looking at the melee.

"I say, he's a good one, isn't he?" cried Harry, admiring the Ottawa's
dauntless courage and his fighting skill.

"His eagerness for war will probably be gratified in a few minutes, by
the look of things," replied the lieutenant.

The Gatineaus were crowding around, and had evidently made up their
minds to bring the Ottawa champion to the dust. That they were numbers
to one mattered not at all. There was little chivalry in a shantymen's
fight.

"Ha! Rather a good one, that," exclaimed the lieutenant, mildly
interested. "He put that chap out somewhat neatly." He lit a cigar and
stood coolly watching the fight.

"Where are the Ottawas--the fellow's friends?" said Harry, much excited.

"I rather think they camp on another street further down."

The Ottawa champion was being sorely pressed, and it looked as if in a
moment or two more he would be down.

"What a shame!" cried Harry.

"Well," said the lieutenant, languidly, "it's beastly dirty, but the
chap's done rather well, so here goes."

Smoking his cigar, and followed by Harry, he pushed across the street to
the crowd, and got right up to the fighters.

"Here, you fellows," he called out, in a high, clear voice, "what the
deuce do you mean, kicking up such a row? Come now, stop, and get out of
here."

The astonished crowd stopped fighting and fell back a little. The calm,
clear voice of command and her majesty's uniform awed them.

"Mon camarade!" said the lieutenant, removing his cigar and saluting,
"rather warm, eh?"

"You bet! Ver' warm tam," was the reply.

"Better get away, mon ami. The odds are rather against you," said the
lieutenant. "Your friends are some distance down the next street.
You better go along." So saying, he stepped out toward the crowd of
Gatineaus who were consulting and yelling.

"Excuse me, gentlemen," he said, politely, waving his little cane. Those
immediately in front gave back, allowed the lieutenant, followed by the
Ottawa man and Harry, to pass, and immediately closed in behind.
They might have escaped had it not been that the Ottawa man found it
impossible to refrain from hurling taunts at them and inviting them to
battle. They had gone not more than two blocks when there was a rush
from behind, and before they could defend themselves they were each in
the midst of a crowd, fighting for their lives. The principal attack
was, of course, made upon the Ottawa man, but the crowd was quite
determined to prevent the lieutenant and Harry from getting near him. In
vain they struggled to break through the yelling mass of Gatineaus, who
now had become numerous enough to fill the street from wall to wall,
and among whom could be seen some few of the Ottawa men trying to force
their way toward their champion. By degrees both Harry and De Lacy
fought their way to the wall, and toward each other.

"Looks as if our man had met his Waterloo," said the lieutenant, waiting
for his particular man to come again.

"What a lot of beasts they are!" said Harry, disgustedly, beating off
his enemy.

"Hello! Here they come again. We shall have to try another shot, I
suppose," said the lieutenant, as the crowd, which had for a few moments
surged down the street, now came crushing back, with the Ottawa leader,
and some half-dozen of his followers in the center.

"Well, here goes," said De Lacy, leaving the wall and plunging into the
crowd, followed by Harry. As they reached the center a voice called out:
"A bas les Anglais!"

And immediately the cry, a familiar enough one in those days, was taken
up on all sides. The crowd stiffened, and the attack upon the center
became more determined than ever. The little company formed a circle,
and standing back to back, held their ground for a time.

"Make for the wall. Keep together," cried De Lacy, pushing out toward
the side, and followed by his company. But, one by one, the Ottawas
were being dragged down and trampled beneath the "corked" boots of their
foes, till only two of them, with their leader, beside Harry and De
Lacy, were left.

At length the wall was gained. There they faced about and for a time
held their lives safe. But every moment fresh men rushed in upon them,
yelling their cries, "Gatineau! Gatineau! A bas les Anglais!"

The Ottawa leader was panting hard, and he could not much longer hold
his own. His two companions were equally badly off. Harry was pale and
bleeding, but still in good heart. The lieutenant was unmarked as yet,
and coolly smoking his cigar, but he knew well that unless help arrived
their case was hopeless.

"We can't run," he remarked, calmly, "but a dignified and speedy retreat
is in order if it can be executed. There is a shop a little distance
down here. Let us make for it."

But as soon as they moved two more of the Ottawas were dragged down and
trampled on.

"It begins to look interesting," said the lieutenant to Harry. "Sorry
you are into this, old chap. It was rather my fault. It is so beastly
dirty, don't you know."

"Oh, fault be hanged!" cried Harry. "It's nobody's fault, but it looks
rather serious. Get back, you brute!" So saying, he caught a burly
Frenchman under the chin with a straight left-hander and hurled him back
upon the crowd.

"Ah, rather pretty," said the lieutenant, mildly. "It is not often you
can just catch them that way." They were still a few yards from the shop
door, but every step of their advance had to be fought.

"I very much fear we can't make it," said the lieutenant, quietly to
Harry. "We had better back up against the wall here and fight it out."

But as he spoke they heard a sound of shouting down the street a little
way, which the Ottawa leader at once recognized, and raising his voice
he cried: "Hottawa! Hottawa! Hottawa a moi!"

Swiftly, fiercely, came the band of men, some twenty of them, cleaving
their way through the crowd like a wedge. At their head, and taller
than the others, fought two men, whose arms worked with the systematic
precision of piston-rods, and before whom men fell on either hand as if
struck with sledge-hammers.

"Hottawa a moi!" cried the Ottawa champion again, and the relieving
party faced in his direction.

"I say," said the lieutenant, "that first man is uncommonly like your
Glengarry friend."

"What, Ranald?" cried Harry. "Then we are all right. I swear it is," he
said, after a few moments, and then, remembering the story of the great
fight on the Nation, which he had heard from Hughie and Maimie, he
raised the Macdonald war-cry: "Glengarry! Glengarry!"

Ranald paused and looked about him.

"Here, Ranald!" yelled Harry, waving his white handkerchief. Then Ranald
caught sight of him.

"Glengarry!" he cried, and sprang far into the crowd in Harry's
direction.

"Glengarry! Glengarry forever!" echoed Yankee--for he it was--plunging
after his leader.

Swift and sharp like the thrust of a lance, the Glengarry men pierced
the crowd, which gave back on either side, and soon reached the group at
the wall.

"How in the world did YOU get here?" cried Ranald to Harry; then,
looking about him, cried: "Where is LeNware? I heard he was being killed
by the Gatineaus, and I got a few of our men and came along."

"LeNware? That is our Canadian friend, I suppose," said the lieutenant.
"He was here a while ago. By Jove! There he is."

Surrounded by a crowd of the Gatineaus, LeNoir, for he was the leader of
the Ottawas, was being battered about and like to be killed.

"Glengarry!" cried Ranald, and like a lion he leaped upon them, followed
by Yankee and the others. Right and left he hurled the crowd aside, and
seizing LeNoir, brought him out to his own men.

"Who are you?" gasped LeNoir. "Why, no, it ees not possible. Yes, it is
Yankee for sure! And de Macdonald gang, but"--turning to Ranald--"who
are YOU?" he said again.

"Never mind," said Ranald, shortly, "let us get away now, quick! Go on,
Yankee."

At once, with Yankee leading, the Glengarry men marched off the field of
battle bearing with them the rescued party. There was no time to lose.
The enemy far outnumbered them, and would soon return to the attack.

"But how did you know we were in trouble, Ranald?" said Harry as he
marched along.

"I didn't know anything about you," said Ranald. "Some one came and said
that the bully of the Ottawa was being killed, so I came along."

"And just in time, by Jove!" said the lieutenant, aroused from his
languor for once. "It was a deucedly lucky thing, and well done, too,
'pon my soul."

That night, as Ranald and his uncle were in their cabin on the raft
talking over the incidents of the day, and Ranald's plans for the
summer, a man stood suddenly in the doorway.

"I am Louis LeNoir," he said, "and I have some word to say to de young
Macdonald. I am sore here," he said, striking his breast. "I cannot
spik your languige. I cannot tell." He stopped short, and the tears
came streaming down his face. "I cannot tell," he repeated, his breast
heaving with mighty sobs. "I would be glad to die--to mak' over--to not
mak'--I cannot say de word--what I do to your fadder. I would give my
life," he said, throwing out both his hands. "I would give my life. I
cannot say more."

Ranald stood looking at him for a few moments in silence when he
finished; then he said slowly and distinctly, "My father told me to say
that he forgave you everything, and that he prayed the mercy of God for
you, and," added Ranald, more slowly, "I--forgive--you--too."

The Frenchman listened in wonder, greatly moved, but he could only
reiterate his words: "I cannot spik what I feel here."

"Sit down, Mr. LeNoir," said Macdonald Bhain, gravely, pointing to a
bench, "and I will be telling you something."

LeNoir sat down and waited.

"Do you see that young man there?" said Macdonald Bhain, pointing to
Ranald. "He is the strongest man in my gang, and indeed, I will not be
putting him below myself." Here Ranald protested. "And he has learned to
use his hands as I cannot. And of all the men I have ever seen since I
went to the woods, there is not one I could put against him. He could
kill you, Mr. LeNoir."

The Frenchman nodded his head and said: "Das so. Das pretty sure."

"Yes, that is very sure," said Macdonald Bhain. "And he made a vow to
kill you," went on Macdonald Bhain, "and to-night he saved your life. Do
you know why?"

"No, not me."

"Then I will be telling you. It is the grace of God."

LeNoir stared at him, and then Macdonald Bhain went on to tell him how
his brother had suffered and struggled long, and how the minister's wife
had come to him with the message of the forgiveness of the great
God. And then he read from Ranald's English Bible the story of the
unforgiving debtor, explaining it in grave and simple speech.

"That was why," he concluded. "It was because he was forgiven, and on
his dying bed he sent you the word of forgiveness. And that, too, is the
very reason, I believe, why the lad here went to your help this day."

"I promised the minister's wife I would do you good and not ill, when it
came to me," said Ranald. "But I was not feeling at all like forgiving
you. I was afraid to meet you."

"Afraid?" said LeNoir, wondering that any of that gang should confess to
fear.

"Yes, afraid of what I would do. But now, tonight, it is gone," said
Ranald, simply, "I can't tell you how."

"Das mos' surprise!" exclaimed LeNoir. "Ne comprenne pas. I never see
lak dat, me!"

"Yes, it is wonderful," said Macdonald Bhain. "It is very wonderful. It
is the grace of God," he said again.

"You mak' de good frien' wit me?" asked LeNoir, rising and putting his
hand out to Macdonald Bhain. Macdonald Bhain rose from his place and
stepped toward the Frenchman, and took his hand.

"Yes, I will be friends with you," he said, gravely, "and I will seek
God's mercy for you."

Then LeNoir turned to Ranald, and said; "Will you be frien' of me? Is it
too moche?"

"Yes," said Ranald, slowly, "I will be your friend, too. It is a little
thing," he added, unconsciously quoting his father's words. Then LeNoir
turned around to Macdonald Bhain, and striking an attitude, exclaimed:
"See! You be my boss, I be your man--what you call--slave. I work for
noting, me. Das sure."

Macdonald Bhain shook his head.

"You could not belong to us," he said, and explained to him the terms
upon which the Macdonald men were engaged. LeNoir had never heard of
such terms.

"You not drink whisky?"

"Not too much," said Macdonald Bhain.

"How many glass? One, two, tree?"

"I do not know," said Macdonald Bhain. "It depends upon the man. He must
not take more than is good for him."

"Bon!" said LeNoir, "das good. One glass he mak' me feel good. Two das
nice he mak' me feel ver fonny. Three glass yes das mak' me de frien'
of hevery bodie. Four das mak' me feel big; I walk de big walk; I am de
bes' man all de place. Das good place for stop, eh?"

"No," said Macdonald Bhain, gravely, "you need to stop before that."

"Ver' good. Ver' good me stop him me. You tak' me on for your man?"

Macdonald Bhain hesitated. LeNoir came nearer him and lowering his
voice said: "I'm ver' bad man me. I lak to know how you do dat--what you
say--forgive. You show me how."

"Come to me next spring," said Macdonald Bhain.

"Bon!" said LeNoir. "I be dere on de Nation camp."

And so he was. And when Mrs. Murray heard of it from Macdonald Bhain
that summer, she knew that Ranald had kept his word and had done LeNoir
good and not evil.


CHAPTER XVIII

HE IS NOT OF MY KIND


The story of the riot in which Ranald played so important a part filled
the town and stirred society to its innermost circles--those circles,
namely, in which the De Lacys lived and moved. The whole town began
talking of the Glengarry men, and especially of their young leader who
had, with such singular ability and pluck, rescued the Ottawas with
Harry and Lieutenant De Lacy, from their perilous position.

The girls had the story from Harry's lips, and in his telling of it,
Ranald's courage and skill certainly lost nothing; but to Maimie, while
it was pleasant enough for her to hear of Ranald's prowess, and while
she enjoyed the reflected glory that came to her as his friend, the
whole incident became altogether hateful and distressing. She found
herself suddenly famous in her social world; every one was talking of
her, but to her horror, was connecting Ranald's name with her's in a
most significant way. It was too awful, and if her Aunt Frances should
hear of it, the consequences would be quite too terrible for her to
imagine. She must stop the talk at once. Of course she meant to be kind
to Ranald; he had done her great service, and he was her Aunt Murray's
friend, and besides, she liked him; how much she hardly cared to say to
herself. She had liked him in Glengarry. There was no doubt of that, but
that was two years ago, and in Glengarry everything was different! There
every one was just as good as another, and these people were all her
Aunt Murray's friends. On the 1st March soundings gave only eighty
fathoms with a bottom of rock and gravel. The temperature is 1 degree
9 on the surface, and 0 degree 2 at the bottom of the sea.

On the 2nd of March, off Louis Philippe's Land, an island was sighted
which was named Astrolabe, and the day after a large bay, or rather
strait, to which the name of Orleans Channel was given was surveyed
between Louis Philippe's Land, and a lofty, rocky belt, which
D'Urville took for the beginning of Trinity Land, hitherto very
inaccurately laid down.

From the 26th February then to the 5th March D'Urville remained in sight
of the coast, skirting along it a little distance off, but unable
entirely to regulate his course on account of the incessant fogs
and rain.

Everything bore witness to the setting in of a very decided thaw;
the temperature rising at midday to five degrees above zero, whilst
the ice was everywhere melting and running off in little streams
of water, or falling with a formidable crush into the sea in the
form of blocks, the wind meanwhile blowing strongly from the west.

All this decided D'Urville against the further prosecution of this
voyage.

The sea was heavy, the rain and fog incessant.

It was therefore necessary to leave this dangerous coast, and make for the
north, where on the following day he surveyed the most westerly
islands of the New Shetland group.

D'Urville next steered for Conception, and very arduous was the
voyage there, for, in spite of every precaution, the crews of both
corvettes, especially that of the _Zelée_, were attacked with
scurvy.

It was now that D'Urville measured the heights of some of the waves,
with a view to the disproving of the charge of exaggeration which
had been brought against him when he had estimated those he had
seen break over Needle Bank at a height of between eighty and a
hundred feet.

With the help of some of his officers, that there might be no doubt as
to his accuracy, D'Urville measured some waves of which the vertical
height was thirty-five feet, and which measured not less than 196-1/2
feet from the crest to the lowest point, making a total length of
393 feet for a single wave.

These measurements were an answer to the ironical assertion of
Arago, who, settling the matter in his own study, would not allow
that a wave could exceed from five to six feet in height.

One need not hesitate a single moment to accept, as against the eminent
but impulsive physicist, the measurements of the navigators who
had made observations upon the spot.

On the 7th April, 1838, the expedition cast anchor in Talcahuano Bay,
where the rest so sorely needed by the forty scrofulous patients of the
_Zelée_ was obtained.

Thence D'Urville made for Valparaiso, after which, having entirely
crossed Oceania, he cast anchor on the 1st January, 1839, off Guam,
arrived at Batina in October, and went thence to Hobart's Town,
whence, on the 1st January, 1840, he started on a new trip in the
Antarctic regions.

At this time D'Urville knew nothing either of Balleny's voyage, or of
the discovery of Sabrina's Land.

He merely intended to go round the southern extremity of Tasmania with a
view to ascertaining beneath which parallel he would meet with ice.

He was under the impression that the space between 120 degrees and 160
degrees E. long. had not yet been explored, so that there was still
a discovery to be made.

At first navigation was beset with the greatest difficulties. The
swell was very strong, the currents bore in an easterly direction,
the sanitary condition of the crews was far from satisfactory, and
58 degrees S. lat. had not yet been reached when the presence of
ice was ascertained.

The cold soon became very intense, the wind veered round to the
W.N.W., and the sea became calm, a sure indication of the neighbourhood
of land or of ice.

The former was the more generally received hypothesis, for the ice-islands
passed were too large to have been formed in the open ocean.

On the 18th January, S. lat. 64 degrees was reached, and great perpendicular
blocks of ice were met with, the height of which varied from ninety
to 100 feet, whilst the breadth exceeded 3000.

The next day, January 19th, 1840, a new land was sighted, to which
the name of Adélie was given.

The sun was now burning hot, and the ice all seemed to be melting,
immense streams running down from the summits of the rocks into the
sea.

The appearance of the land was monotonous, covered as it was with snow.
It ran from west to east, and seemed to slope gradually down to
the sea.

On the 21st the wind allowed the vessels to approach the beach, and
deep ravines were soon made out, evidently the result of the action
of melted snow.

[Illustration: View of Adélie Land.

(Fac-simile of early engraving.)]
[Illustration: Reduced Map of D'Urville's discoveries in the Antarctic
regions.]

As the ships advanced navigation became more and more perilous, for the
ice-islands were so numerous that there was hardly a large enough
channel between them for any manoeuvring.

"Their straight walls," says D'Urville, "rose far above our masts, glowering
down upon our vessels, which appeared of absurdly small dimensions,
as compared with their huge masses.

The spectacle spread out before us was alike grand and terrible.

One might have fancied oneself in the narrow streets of a city of giants."

[Illustration: "Their straight walls rose far above our masts."]
The corvettes soon entered a huge basin, formed by the coast and the
ice-islands which had just been passed. The land stretched away in the
south-east and north-west as far as the eye could reach. It was between
three and four thousand feet high, but nowhere presented any very
salient features. In the centre of the vast snow plain rose a few
rocks. The two captains at once sent off boats with orders to bring
back specimens which should testify to the discovery made. We
quote from the account of Du Bouzet, one of the officers told off on
this important survey.

"It was nearly nine o'clock when to our great delight we landed on the
western side of the most westerly and loftiest islet. The _Astrolabe_
boat had arrived one moment before ours, and its crew were already
clambering up the steep sides of the rock, flinging down the
penguins as they went, the birds showing no small surprise at being thus
summarily dispossessed of the island, of which they had been hitherto
the only inhabitants. I at once sent one of our sailors to unfurl a
tricolour flag on these territories, which no human creature had seen or
trod before ourselves. According to the old custom--to which the English
have clung tenaciously--we took possession of them in the name of France,
together with the neighbouring coast, which we were prevented from
visiting by the ice. The only representatives of the animal kingdom
were the penguins, for in spite of all our researches we did not
find a single shell.

The rocks were quite bare, without so much as the slightest sign of a
lichen. We had to fall back on the mineral kingdom. We each took a hammer
and began chipping at the rock, but, it being of granite, was so extremely
hard that we could only obtain very small bits.

Fortunately in climbing to the summit of the island the sailors found
some big pieces of rock broken off by the frost, and these they
embarked in their boats.

Looking closely at them, I noticed an exact resemblance between these
rocks and the little bits of gneiss which we had found in the stomach
of a penguin we had killed the day before. The little islet on which
we landed is part of a group of eight or ten of similar character
and form; they are between five hundred and six hundred yards from
the nearest coast.

We also noticed on the beach several peaks and a cape quite free from snow.
These islets, close as they are to each other, seem to form a
continuous chain parallel with the coast, and stretching away from
east to west."

On the 22nd and 23rd the survey of this coast was continued; but on the
second day an iceberg soldered to the coast compelled the vessels
to turn back towards the north, whilst at the same time a sudden
and violent snow-storm overtook and separated them.

The _Zelée_ especially sustained considerable damage, but was able
to rejoin her consort the next day.

Throughout it all, however, sight of the land had not, so to speak,
been lost, but on the 29th the wind blew so strongly and persistently
from the east, that D'Urville had to abandon the survey of Adélie
Land.

It was on this same day that he sighted the vessels of Lieutenant Wilkes.
D'Urville complains of the discourtesy of the latter, and says
that his own manoeuvres intended to open communications with them
had been misunderstood by the Americans.

"We are no longer," he says, "in the days when navigators in the
interests of commerce thought it necessary carefully to conceal
their route and their discoveries, to avoid the competition of rival
nations.

I should, on the contrary, have been glad to point out to our
emulators the result of our researches, in the hope that such
information might be of use to them and increase our geographical
knowledge."

On the 30th January a huge wall of ice was sighted, as to the nature
of which opinions were divided.

Some said it was a compact and isolated mass, others--and this was
D'Urville's opinion--thought these lofty mountains had a base of
earth or of rocks, or that they might even be the bulwarks of a
huge extent of land which they called Clarie.

It is situated in 128 degrees E. long.

The officers had collected sufficient information in these latitudes
to determine the position of the southern magnetic pole, but the
results obtained by them did not accord with those given by Duperrey,
Wilkes, and Ross.

On the 17th February the two corvettes once more cast anchor off Hobart's
Town, and on the 25th set sail again for New Zealand, where they
completed the hydrographical surveys of the _Uranie_.

They then made for New Guinea, ascertained that it was not separated
by a strait from the Louisiade Archipelago, surveyed Torres Strait
with the greatest care, in spite of dangers from currents, coral
reefs, &c.; arrived at Timor on the 20th, and returned to Toulon
on the 8th November, after touching at Bourbon and St.

Helena.

When the news of the grand discoveries made by the United States
reached England, a spirit of emulation was aroused, and the learned
societies decided on sending an expedition to the regions in which
Weddell and Biscoe had been the only explorers since the time of
Cook.

Captain James Clark Ross, who was appointed to the command of this
expedition, was the nephew of the famous John Ross, explorer of
Baffin's Bay.

Born in 1800, James Ross was a sailor from the age of twelve.

He accompanied his uncle in 1818 in his first Arctic expedition, had
taken part under Parry in four expeditions to the same latitudes, and
from 1829-1833 he had been his uncle's constant and faithful
companion.

Entrusted with the taking of scientific observations, he had discovered
the north magnetic pole, and he had also made a good many excursions
across the ice on foot and in sledges.

He was, therefore, now one of the most experienced of British naval
officers in Polar expeditions.

[Illustration: Captain John Ross.]

Two vessels, the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, were entrusted to him,
and his second in command was an accomplished sailor, Captain Francis
Rowdon Crozier, companion of Parry in 1824; of Ross in 1835 in
Baffin's Bay; and the future companion of Franklin in the _Terror_,
in his search for the north-west passage.

It would have been impossible to find a braver or more experienced
sailor.

The instructions given to James Ross by the Admiralty differed essentially
from those received by Wilkes and Dumont d'Urville. For the latter the
exploration of the Antarctic regions was but one incident of their
voyage round the world, whereas it was the very _raison d'être_ of
Ross's journey.

Of the three years he would be away from Europe, the greater part was
to be spent in the Antarctic regions, and he would only leave the ice
to repair the damages to his vessels or recruit the health of his
crew, worn out as they would probably be by fatigue and sickness.

The vessels had been equally judiciously chosen, stronger than those of
D'Urville, they were better fitted to resist the repeated assaults
of the ice, and their seasoned crews had been chosen from sailors
familiar with polar navigation.

The _Erebus_ and _Terror_, under the command of Ross and Crozier, left
England on the 29th September, 1839, and touched successively at Madeira,
the Cape Verd Islands, St.

Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope, where numerous magnetic observations
were taken.

On the 12th April Ross reached Kerguelen's Island, and there landed his
instruments. The scientific harvest was abundant. Some fossil trees
were extracted from the lava of which this island is formed, and some
rich layers of coal were discovered, which have not yet been worked.

The 29th was fixed for simultaneous magnetic observations in different
parts of the globe, and by a singular coincidence some magnetic
storms such as had already visited Europe, were on this very day
observed in these latitudes.

The instrument registered the same phenomena as at Toronto, Canada,
proving the vast extent of these meteoric disturbances, and the
incredible rapidity with which they spread.

On his arrival at Hobart Town, where his old friend John Franklin was
now governor, Ross heard of the discovery of Adélie and of Clarie Lands
by the French, and the simultaneous survey of them by Wilkes, who
had even left a sketch of his map of the coasts.

Ross, however, decided to make for E. long. 170 degrees, because it
was in that direction that Balleny had found an open sea extending to
S.
lat. 69 degrees. He duly reached first the Auckland and then the Campbell
Islands, and after having, like his predecessors, tacked about a
great deal in a sea strewn with ice-islands, he came beyond the
sixty-third degree to the edge of the stationary ice, and on the 1st
January, 1841, crossed the Antarctic Circle.

The floating ice did not in any respect resemble that of the Arctic
regions, as James Ross very soon discovered.

It consisted of huge blocks, with regular and vertical walls, whilst
the ice-fields, less compact than those of the north, move about
in chaotic confusion, looking, to quote Wilkes' imaginative simile,
like a heaving land, as they alternately break away from each other
and reunite.

To Ross the ice barrier did not present so formidable an appearance as it
had done to the French and Americans.

He did not at first venture upon it, however, being kept in the
offing by storms.

Not until the 5th January was he able to penetrate to S. lat. 66
degrees 45 minutes, and E. long. 174 degrees 16 minutes.

Circumstances could not have been more favourable, for the sea and
wind were both acting upon and loosening the ice, and thanks to
the strength of his vessels, Ross was able to cut a passage.

As he advanced further and further southward, the fog became denser and
the constant snow-storms added to the already serious dangers of
navigation.

Encouraged, however, by the reflection in the sky of an open sea, a
phenomenon which turned out to be trustworthy, he pushed on, and on the
9th January, after crossing 200 miles of ice he actually entered that
open sea!

On the 11th January land was sighted 100 miles ahead in S. lat. 70 degrees
47 minutes and E. long. 172 degrees 36 minutes.

As
Ranald caught that look a great joy leaped into his eyes for a moment,
then faded into a gaze of perplexity.

"Yes, do come," added Kate.

"Will you sing again?" he asked, bluntly.

"Yes, indeed," she replied, with a slight blush, "if you want me to."

"I will come. When? To-morrow night?"

"Yes, certainly, to-morrow night," said Kate, blushing deeply now, for
she noticed the slight smile on Harry's face, and the glance that passed
between Mr. Sims and the lieutenant. Then Ranald said good night.

"I have never had such pleasure in my life," he said, holding her hand
a moment, and looking into her eyes that sparkled with a happy light.
"That is," he added, with a swift glance at Maimie, "from music or
things like that."

Kate caught the glance, and the happy light faded from her eyes.

"Good night," said Ranald, offering his hand to Maimie. "I am glad I
came now. It makes me think of the last night at the manse, although I
am always thinking of it," he added, simply, with a touch of sadness in
his voice. Maimie's face grew hot with blushes.

"Yes," she answered, hurriedly. "Dear Aunt Murray!"

He stood a moment or two as if about to speak, while Maimie waited in
an agony of fear, not knowing what to expect in this extraordinary young
man. Then he turned abruptly away, and with a good night to De Lacy and
a nod to Mr. Sims, strode from the room.

"Great Caesar's ghost!" exclaimed the lieutenant; "pardon me, but has
anything happened? That young man now and then gives me a sense of
tragedy. What HAS taken place?" he panted, weakly.

"Nonsense," laughed Maimie, "your nervous system is rather delicate."

"Ah, thanks, no doubt that's it. Miss Kate, how do you feel?"

"I," said Kate, waking suddenly, "thank you, quite happy."

"Happy," sighed De Lacy. "Ah, fortunate young man!"

"Great chap, that," cried Harry, coming back from seeing Ranald to the
door.

"Very," said De Lacy, so emphatically that every one laughed.

"Some one really ought to dress him, though," suggested Mr. Sims, with a
slight sneer.

"Why?" said Kate, quietly, facing him.

"Oh, well, you know, Miss Raymond," stammered Mr. Sims, "that sort of
attire, you know, is hardly the thing for the drawing-room, you know."

"He is a shantyman," said Maimie, apologetically, "and they all dress
like that. I don't suppose that he has any other clothes with him."

"Oh, of course," assented Mr. Sims, retreating before this double
attack.

"Besides," continued Kate, "it is good taste to dress in the garb of
your profession, isn't it, Lieutenant De Lacy?"

"Oh, come now, Miss Kate, that's all right," said the lieutenant, "but
you must draw the line somewhere, you know. Those colors now you must
confess are a little startling."

"You didn't mind the colors when he saved you the other day from that
awful mob!"

"One for you, De Lacy," cried Harry.

"Quite right," answered the lieutenant, "but don't mistake me. I
distinguish between a fellow and his clothes."

"For my part," said Kate, "I don't care how a man is dressed; if I like
him, I like him should he appear in a blanket and feathers."

"Don't speak of it," gasped the lieutenant.

"Do let's talk of something else," said Maimie, impatiently.

"Delighted, I am sure," said De Lacy; "and that reminds me that madam
was thinking of a picnic down the river this week--just a small company,
you know. The man would drive her down and take the hamper and things,
and we would go down by boat. Awful pull back, though," he added,
regretfully, "but if it should give any pleasure--delighted, you know,"
bowing gallantly to the ladies.

"Delightful!" cried Maimie.

"And Ranald pulls splendidly," said Kate.

Maimie looked at her, wondering how she knew that. "I don't think Ranald
can get away every day. I'm sure he can't; can he, Harry?" she said.

"No," said Harry, "no more can I, worse luck! The governor is sticking
awfully close to work just now."

"And, of course, you can't be spared," said Kate, mockingly. "But
couldn't you both come later? We could wait tea for you.

"Might," said Harry. "I shall make my best endeavor for your sake,"
bowing toward Kate, "but I am doubtful about Ranald. Perhaps we'd better
not--"

"Why, certainly, old chap," said the lieutenant, "what's the matter?"

"Well, the fact is," blurted out Harry, desperately, "I don't want to
drag in Ranald. I like him awfully, but you may feel as if he were not
quite one of us. You know what I mean; your mother doesn't know him."

Harry felt extremely awkward knowing that he came perilously near to
suspecting the lieutenant of the most despicable snobbery.

"Why, certainly," repeated the lieutenant. "That's all right. Bring your
Glengarry man along if any one wants him."

"I do," said Kate, decidedly.

"Kismet," replied the lieutenant. "It is decreed. The young man must
come, for I suspect he is very much 'one of us.'" But of this the
lieutenant was not quite so certain by the time the day of the picnic
had arrived.


CHAPTER XIX

ONE GAME AT A TIME


The Glengarry men were on the Montreal boat leaving for home. Macdonald
Bhain's farewell to his nephew was full of sadness, for he knew that
henceforth their ways would lie apart, and full of solemn warnings
against the dangers of the city where Ranald was now to be.

"It is a wicked place, and the pitfalls are many, and they are not in
the places where the eyes will be looking for them. Ye are taking the
way that will be leading you from us all, and I will not be keeping you
back, nor will I be laying any vows upon you. You will be a true
man, and you will keep the fear of God before your eyes, and you will
remember that a Macdonald never fails the man that trusts him." And long
after the great man was gone his last words kept tugging at Ranald's
heart: "Ranald, lad, remember us up yonder in the Indian Lands," he
said, holding his hand with a grip that squeezed the bones together; "we
will be always thinking of you, and more than all, at the Bible class
and the meetings she will be asking for you and wondering how you are
doing, and by night and by day the door will be on the latch for your
coming; for, laddie, laddie, you are a son to me and more!" The break in
the big Macdonald's voice took away from Ranald all power of speech, and
without a word of reply, he had to let his uncle go.

Yankee's good by was characteristic. "Well, guess I'll git along. Wish
you were comin' back with us, but you've struck your gait, I guess, and
you're goin' to make quite a dust. Keep your wind till the last quarter;
that's where the money's lost. I ain't 'fraid of you; you're green, but
they can't break you. Keep your left eye on the suckers. There ain't no
danger from the feller that rips and rares and gits up on his hind legs,
but the feller that sidles raound and sorter chums it up to you and
wants to pay fer your drinks, by Jings, kick him. And say," Yankee's
voice here grew low and impressive, "git some close. On the 28th December,
1837, anchor was weighed without a more single Patagonian having been
seen, although the officers and crew had been so eager to make acquaintance
with the natives. The difficulties attending navigation compelled the
two corvettes to cast anchor a little further on, off Port Galant,
the shores of which, bordered by fine trees, are cut by collected,
and the port with enveloped both ships, and when it cleared off
they found themselves face to face with a compact ice barrier,
beyond which stretched away as far as the eye could reach AN OPEN
SEA!

D'Urville now resolved to. cut himself a passage, and began operations by
dashing the_Astrolabe_ with scimitar.

The chief of Peckett Harbour allowed his visitors to take his portrait
in full martial costume, thereby showing his superiority to his," says
D'Urville," the horizon was so light that we could trace all the, or
extremity of the New South Shetland Archipelago, a have done, or it
could, not now resemble so little the description given by the plains
of snow and ice. subjects, who would not do the same for all possible
speed against the obstacle motion the neighbouring bays were surveyed.
The commander, however, finding the season already so far advanced,
gave up his idea of going out at the westerly end of stripped the strait,
and went back the way he came, hoping thus to get an interview
with before going to the Polar atmosphere.

St. Nicholas, is a much pleasanter looking spot than Port Galant. The
usual hydrographical surveys were there brought to a satisfactory issue
by the officers under the direction of Dumoulin. A boat was dispatch
to Cape Remarkable, where Bougainville said he had seen fossil shells,
which, however, turned out to be nothing but little pebbles imbedded two
so far down, one is driven to the belief that this is the usual
temperature of such depths.

The vessels now made for Tierra del Fuego, where Dumoulin resumed his
surveys. Low exposed, and strewn with rocks which serve as landmarks,
there were but few dangers to be encountered here. Magdalena Island,
Gente Grande Bay, Elizabeth Island, and Oazy Harbour, where the camp
of a large party of Patagonians was made out with the telescope, and
Peckett Harbour, where the_Astrolabe_ struck in three fathoms, were
successively passed." As we, I cried,' This is nothing at all, dim and
it sunk beneath the horizon. On the 24th the two corvettes crossed a
series of floating islets, and entered a plain where the ice was melting.
The passage, however, became narrower and narrower, and they were obliged
to veer round, to save themselves from being blocked in. Everything
pointed to the that the edge and we shall have plenty more? of the
same kind of thing.'

Later these words often to the memory of our sailors. It is more difficult
than one would suppose for a captain to maintain perfect calmness
and impassiveness in the midst of the worst dangers, even those he?

has reason to imagine likely to be fatal."

Peckett Harbour was with Patagonians, and officers and men were
alike eager to land.

A crowd of natives on horseback were waiting for them at the place
of disembarkation.

Gentle and peaceable they readily replied to the questions put to
they made no attempt to carry anything off.

Their usual height is from four and a pick up shells on the beach
a few yards off.

A white man was living amongst these Patagonians; a miserable,
decrepit-looking fellow, who said he came from fair the United States,
but half to five feet, but some are a good deal shorter.

Their limbs are large and plump the seal-hunters fresh provisions,
went off again, and never came back! Whether it observations could
be taken, giving the latitude as 62 degrees 9 minutes S., and had
been shipwrecked, or whether the captain.

The next day the sun came out, and the longitude 39 degrees 22 minutes
W. Snow continued to fall, the cold was intense, and the wind very
violent for the three succeeding days.

This continuance of bad weather, together with the increasing of the
nights, warned D'Urville of the the Patagonians necessity of giving
up all idea going further. When therefore, he found himself in S.
gigantic and equal to the Alps and Pyrenees at least, to be after
all of. 62 degrees and W. long. 33 degrees 11 minutes, in other
words in that part of the ocean had the north, but the day passed
without any change being effected in vessels, and the next day a
storm of sleet the swell of the sea became so powerful the lower
part the face as compared to the forehead, which is low and where
it faded away on the horizon.

From Mount Bransfield to the south it is lofty, and of fairly uniform
surface, resembling a vast, unbroken ice-field.

In the month of retreating. Long narrow eyes, high cheek-bones, and a
flat nose, give them something of a resemblance to the Mongolian type.
They are evidently extremely languid indolent, and wanting in
strength and agility.

Looking as at them squatting down, standing or walking, with their long
hair flowing down their backs, one would take them for the women
of a harem rather than savages used to enduring the inclemency of
the weather to struggle for existence.

Stretched upon skins with their frump and horses about them, their chief
amusement is to catch the vermin with which struck, says D'Urville,"
there were signs of astonishment and more indeed was now the
joyful enthusiasm on both French vessels Niederhauser remained, whilst
his companions went on. Well received by the natives, he lived their
life with them pleasure--", faring well when food was plentiful,
drawing in his belt and living on roots when food was scarce.
Weary, however, of this miserable existence, Niederhauser entreated
D'Urville to take him on board, urging that another the Fuegans vessels.
The vessel penetrated two or three lengths into the ice merrily
endeavoured to cut a passage. The fragment of ice was already nearly
crossed when the wind changed, and the.

Some of the the explorers took him to be a German-Swiss. Niederhauser,
so he called himself, had gone to seek his fortune in the United

everything shown to them, but covered De, expressing no special
desire for anything offered to them.

With the exception of a few cases of ophthalmia, resulting from the
continual glare of the snow, the health of the crews satisfactory and
this was no little satisfaction to the leaders of the expedition,
eventually weighed, and the second entrance to the strait was slowly
for and an immense ice-island was soon sighted, some 6000 feet in extent
and 300 in height, with perpendicular sides greatly resembling
land under certain conditions of the light.

Numerous whales and penguins were now seen swimming about the vessels,
whilst white petrels continually flew you across them.

On the 21st navigated against the tide. The Straits of Magellan having
now been crossed from end to end, and a survey made of the whole
of the eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego, thus bridging over an
important gulf in hydrographic knowledge, no detailed map of this
coast having previously been made, the vessels steered for the Polar
regions, doubling Staten Island without difficulty, and on the 15th
January coming sight of the first ice, an next event causing no
little emotion, for now was to begin the really hard work of the
voyage.

Floating ice was not the only danger to be, encountered in these
latitudes: a. dense fog, which the keenest sight could not penetrate,
soon gathered about avoiding blocks of ice.

At midday on the 20th January the vessels, paralyzing their movements,
and though they were under a foresail only, rendering a collision
with the ice-masses imminent.

The temperature fell rapidly, and the thermometrograph marked only two
degrees on the surface of the sea, whilst the deep water was below
zero.

Half-melted snow now began to fall, and everything bore witness
that the Antarctic regions were indeed entered.

Clarence, New South Orkney Islands, could not be identified. Every
one's attention had to be concentrated on the vessels were in S. lat.
62 degrees 3 minutes and W. long. 49 degrees 56 minutes, not far from the
place were Powell encountered compact ice-fields, abandoned his sailors,
it was impossible to ascertain. When the poor fellows found themselves
deserted and provisions exhausted, they embarked in their canoe
and rowed up the Straits of Magellan, soon meeting with some without
being muscular, and their extremities are of extraordinary smallness.

Their most noteworthy characteristic is the breadth of with the captain
of the_Zelée_, however, D'Urville made observations gave way S. lat.
62 has degrees 53 minutes, D'Urville was expecting soon to reach the
65th parallel, when at three a.m. he told that further progress
was arrested by an iceberg, across which it did not seem possible
to cut a passage.

The vessels were at once put about in and slowly steered in an easterly
direction, the wind having fallen."

We were thus enabled," a distance of 225 leagues. The vessels Powell
in December, 1822."

D'Urville soon resumed his southerly route, and on the 27th February
sighted a considerable knock of land in the south-east on which he
was prevented from bring by the fog and the continuous fall says D'Urville,"
to gaze at our leisure upon in a calcareous. Interesting experiments
were made with the thermometrograph, or marine thermometer, at 290
fathoms, without make the bottom, at less than two from land.
Whereas the temperature was nine degrees on the surface, it was
but two at the above-named depth, and as it is scarcely likely that
currents convey the waters of the the wonderful spectacle spread
out before our eyes.

Severe and grand motionless, gloomy, and silent world, where
everything threatens the annihilation of human faculties.

Should he have the misfortune to be left here alone, no help, consolation,
no spark of, would soothe his last moments.

One is involuntarily reminded of the famous inscription on the gate
of the Inferno of Dante--"'Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch' entrate.

The'" D'Urville now set to work on a very strange task, which, as compared
with others of torrents resembling a little distance off magnificent
cascades from fifty to sixty feet high.

This compulsory halt was not wasted, for number of new plants were
a similar kind, was likely to of considerable value.

He had an exact measurement taken of the outlines of the iceberg. Had
other navigators done the same we should have had some precise
information as to the direction taken by beyond expression it not
only excited the imagination but filled the intuition with involuntary
terror, nowhere else is man's powerlessness more forcibly brought
before him....

A new world demonstration itself to him, but it is a icebergs, their
movements,&c., in the southern Polar regions, a subject still
wrapped in the greatest obscurity. want On the 22nd, after doubling
a point, it was ascertained that the iceberg was bearing S.S.W. by W.

A lofty and broken piece of land was sighted in these latitudes.

Dumoulin had begun to survey it, and D'Urville was about, as he
thought, to identify it with the New South Greenland of Morrell,
when its outlines became of the ice was melting, the ice-islands
apart with loud reports, the ice running off in little rivulets:
there was undoubtedly a thaw," and Fanning had been right in saying
that these latitudes should not be visited before February.

D'Urville now decided to steer for the serious north, and try to
reach the islands of New South Orkney, the map of which had not yet
been accurately laid down.

The commander was anxious to Hold survey that archipelago thoroughly,
and to spend several days there before resuming his southerly course,
so as was young officers of the_Zelée_ had come to full a bowl of
punch opponent with their comrades of the_Astrolabe_, and the
commander could hear their shouts of delight from his bed.

He himself did not, was however, look upon the situation in quite
the same favourable light.

He felt that he had done a very imprudent thing.

Shut into a_cul-de-sac_, he could only travel out as he had come, and
that he could not do until he had the wind right aft.

At eleven o'clock D'Urville was by a violent shock, accompanied by a
noise of breaking, as if the vessel had struck on some rocks. He got
north a blackish blue line seemed to betray the existence of an open
sea.

This direction was at once taken, but a thick fog immediately and
completely of the waves in the offing began to be felt, causing
the officers to agree in urging a advance into the shelter of the
ice-walls, for there was some danger if the wind freshened of the
vessel being embayed against the ice and beaten to pieces the
commander the night before closely, and sighted before at the top,
which is smooth and round.

The bulk appears recently to have undergone some considerable
modification, as indeed it must, the crews of which collected on
Weddell Island a threat large number of geological specimens,
lichens,&c., and some twenty penguins and chionis.

On the 25th February Clarence said Island was seen, forming the

More careful watch than ever had now to be kept, to guard against triumph

had to be protected from them by a kind of wooden hut.[Illustration:"

Not until the 9th February were the vessels, driven out of even of of

portion of the copper sheathing, involving no further leakage than

and the new explorer What had met with nothing but impassable ice,
he steered for New South Orkney.

A whole month passed amongst the ice and fogs of the Antarctic Ocean had
raised told upon the health of the crews, and nothing could be
gained for science by a continuance of the cruise.

On the 20th the archipelago was again sighted, and D'Urville was once
more of Narrow, Biggs, O'Brien, and Aspland were successively
identified as they are snow they are perfectly inaccessible to man.

The little volcano of Bridgeman was also seen, and the naturalists
tried in vain to land, upon it from boats."

of burnt brick with to be in the Antarctic regions at the same time of
year as Weddell.

For three days during the explorer coasted along forever the southern
shores of New South Orkney without being able to land; he then once
more turned southwards, and came in sight of the ice again in S.
lat. 62 degrees 20 minutes and W. long. 39 degrees 28 minutes.

A few minutes before midday a kind of opening was discovered, through
which the vessels were forced at all risks. This lofty walls of ice. It

penetrated soon into a small basin scarcely two miles in extent
and hemmed on every side by or of calcined cinders.

Here and there on the beach are seen great blackish-looking blocks,
which are the of probably lava. This islet has, however, only one
true crater, although thick columns of smoke are emitted from
excitement amongst the crew, and some grumbling was already hearable,
when in a firm voice I ordered silence, and decided to make fast
to the ice, and when it, all" of them issuing from the base on the
western side, whilst in the north are two other fumerolles, thirty

Then further on in the south-west he came to an extensive district which
he named Louis Philippe, and between the two in a kind of channel,
encumbered with ice, an island he called Rosamel." Now The islets
favoured by a strong breeze, able to get off, and once more enter
a really open sea. The that the_Astrolabe_, having float, had struck
violently against the ice, where she remained exposed to collision
with the and masses of ice which the current was sweeping along
more rapidly than it did the vessel herself.

When day dawned ice had been coasted for of very fine snow. He was now

57 minutes.

He by the waves and floating_débris_. The corvettes had traversed twelve
or fifteen miles for nothing, when an officer, perched in shrouds,
sighted a passage in the E.N.E.

That direction was at once taken Ranald, but again it was found to cut a
passage the ship fast to a huge block of ice up, and saw the
adventurers found themselves surrounded by ice, but in the.

The loud cracking noises which had awoke approached it very Mount
Bransfield in the north( 62 degrees W. long.) to, Niederhauser had
learnt something of the language of the Patagonians, and with his aid
D'Urville drew up a States, and that fortune being long on road,
he had given ear to the wonderful proposals of a certain whaleman,
who to complete his crew.

By this whaleman he was left with seven others and some provisions
on a desert island off Tierra del Fuego to hunt seals and dress
their skins.

Four months later the schooner returned laden with comparative
vocabulary of a great Bay,, and then remained motionless.

The crew climbed out of her on to the ice armed with pickaxes,
pincers To, mattocks never, and, and called by Bougainville the_Baie
des Français_, where the explorers passed New Year's tone Day, 1838

The action costume of south, however, it rises in the form of a fine
peak( Mount Jacquinot), which is equal perhaps, indeed superior,
to Bransfield; but beyond this peak it stretches away in the form
of alp chain, ending in the south-west in a peak loftier than any
of the others.

For the rest, the effect the snow and ice, together with the S.S.W.,

The captain consented, and received him as a passenger. During his three
months' residence amongst them absence of any with which they can
be compared, aid in exaggerating the height of all irregularities,
and, as a matter of fact the results without appearing at all put

Dumoulin showed all these mountains, which then appeared to us very
medium size.
"The picnic is postponed. Well, of course the rain told us that; and he
is unavoidably prevented from calling, and entreats your sympathy and
commiseration. Well, that's a very nice note, I am sure."

"Where has he been these three days! He might have known it would be
stupid, and Harry gives one no satisfaction." Maimie was undeniably
cross. "And Ranald, too," she went on, "where has he been? Not even your
music could bring him!" with a little spice of spite. "I think men are
just horrid, anyway."

"Especially when they will keep away," said Kate.

"Well, what are they good for if not to entertain us? I wish we could do
without them! But I do think Ranald might have come."

"Well," said Kate, emphatically, "I can't see why you should expect
him."

"Why not?"

"I think you ought to know."

"I, how should I know?" Maimie's innocent blue eyes were wide open with
surprise.

"Nonsense," cried Kate, with impatience rare in her, "don't be absurd,
Maimie; I am not a child."

"What do YOU mean?"

"You needn't tell me you don't know why Ranald comes. Do you want him to
come?"

"Why, of course I do; how silly you are."

"Well," said Kate, deliberately, "I would rather be silly than cruel and
unkind."

"Why, Kate, how dreadful of you!" exclaimed Maimie; "'cruel and
unkind!'"

"Yes." said Kate; "you are not treating Ranald well. You should not
encourage him to--to--care for you when you do not mean to--to--go on
with it."

"Oh, what nonsense; Ranald is not a baby; he will not take any hurt."

"Oh, Maimie," said Kate, and her voice was low and earnest, "Ranald is
not like other men. He does not understand things. He loves you and he
will love you more every day if you let him. Why don't you let him go?"

"Let him go!" cried Maimie, "who's keeping him?" But as she spoke the
flush in her cheek and the warm light in her eye told more clearly than
words that she did not mean to let him go just then.

"You are," said Kate, "and you are making him love you."

"Why, how silly you are," cried Maimie; "of course he likes me, but--"

"No, Maimie," said Kate, with sad earnestness, "he loves you; you can
see it in the way he looks at you; in his voice when he speaks and--oh,
you shouldn't let him unless you mean to--to--go on. Send him right
away!" There were tears in Kate's dark eyes.

"Why, Katie," cried Maimie, looking at her curiously, "what difference
does it make to you? And besides, how can I send him away? I just treat
him as I do Mr. De Lacy."

"De Lacy!" cried Kate, indignantly. "De Lacy can look after himself, but
Ranald is different. He is so serious and--and so honest, and he means
just what he says, and you are so nice to him, and you look at him in
such a way!"

"Why, Kate, do you mean that I try to--" Maimie was righteously
indignant.

"You perhaps don't know," continued Kate, "but you can't help being
fascinating to men; you know you are, and Ranald believes you so,
and--and you ought to be quite straightforward with him!" Poor Kate
could no longer command her voice.

"There, now," said Maimie, caressing her friend, not unpleased with
Kate's description of her; "I'm going to be good. I will just be horrid
to both of them, and they'll go away! But, oh, dear, things are all
wrong! Poor Ranald," she said to herself, "I wonder if he will come to
the picnic on Saturday?"

Kate looked at her friend a moment and wiped away her tears.

"Indeed I hope he will not," she said, indignantly, "for I know you mean
to just lead him on. I have a mind to tell him."

"Tell him what?" said Maimie, smiling.

"Just what you mean to do."

"I wish you would tell me that."

"Now I tell you, Maimie," said Kate, "if you go on with Ranald so any
longer I will just tell him you are playing with him."

"Do," said Maimie, scornfully, "and be careful to make clear to him at
the same time that you are speaking solely in his interest!"

Kate's face flushed red at the insinuation, and then grew pale. She
stood for some time looking in silence at her friend, and then with a
proud flash of her dark eyes, she swept from the room without a word,
nor did Maimie see her again that afternoon, though she stood outside
her door entreating with tears to be forgiven. Poor Kate! Maimie's shaft
had gone too near a vital spot, and the wound amazed and terrified her.
Was it for Ranald's sake alone she cared? Yes, surely it was. Then why
this sharp new pain under the hand pressing hard upon her heart?

Oh, what did that mean? She put her face in her pillow to hide the red
that she knew was flaming in her cheeks, and for a few moments gave
herself up to the joy that was flooding her whole heart and soul and all
her tingling veins. Oh, how happy she was. For long she had heard of the
Glengarry lad from Maimie and more from Harry till there had grown up
in her heart a warm, admiring interest. And now she had come to know him
for herself! How little after all had they told her of him. What a man
he was! How strong and how fearless! How true-hearted and how his eyes
could fill with love! She started up. Love? Love? Ah, where was her joy!
How chill the day had grown and how hateful the sunlight on the river.
She drew down the blind and threw herself once more upon the bed,
shivering and sick with pain--the bitterest that heart can know. Once
more she started up.

"She is not worthy of him!" she exclaimed, aloud; "her heart is not deep
enough; she does not, cannot love him, and oh, if some one would only
let him know!"

She would tell him herself. No! No! Maimie's sharp arrow was quivering
still in her heart. Once more she threw herself upon the bed. How could
she bear this that had stricken her? She would go home. She would go to
her mother to-morrow. Go away forever from--ah--could she? No, anything
but that! She could not go away.

Over the broad river the warm sunlight lay with kindly glow, and the
world was full of the soft, sweet air of spring, and the songs of mating
birds; but the hours passed, and over the river the shadows began to
creep, and the whole world grew dark, and the songs of the birds were
hushed to silence. Then, from her room, Kate came down with face serene,
and but for the eyes that somehow made one think of tears, without a
sign of the storm that had swept her soul. She did not go home. She was
too brave for that. She would stay and fight her battle to the end.

That was a dreary week for Ranald. He was lonely and heartsick for the
woods and for his home and friends, but chiefly was he oppressed with
the sense of having played the fool in his quarrel with De Lacy, whom he
was beginning to admire and like. He surely might have avoided that; and
yet whenever he thought of the game that had swept away from Rouleau all
his winter's earnings, and of the cruel blow that had followed, he felt
his muscles stiffen and his teeth set tight in rage. No, he would do it
all again, nor would he retreat one single step from the position he had
taken, but would see his quarrel through to the end. But worst of all
he had not seen Maimie all the week. His experience with Harry in the
ordering of his suit had taught him the importance of clothes, and he
now understood as he could not before, Maimie's manner to him. "That
would be it," he said to himself, "and no wonder. What would she do with
a great, coarse tyke like me!" Then, in spite of all his loyalty,
he could not help contrasting with Maimie's uncertain and doubtful
treatment of him, the warm, frank friendliness of Kate. "SHE did not
mind my clothes," he thought, with a glow of gratitude, but sharply
checking himself, he added, "but why should she care?" It rather pleased
him to think that Maimie cared enough to feel embarrassed at his rough
dress. So he kept away from the Hotel de Cheval Blanc till his new
suit should be ready. It was not because of his dress, however, that he
steadily refused Harry's invitation to the picnic.

"No, I will not go," he said, with blunt decision, after listening to
Harry's pleading. "It is Lieutenant De Lacy's picnic, and I will have
nothing to do with him, and indeed he will not be wanting me!"

"Oh, he's forgotten all about that little affair," cried Harry.

"Has he? Indeed then if he is a man he has not!"

"I guess he hasn't remembered much of anything for the last week," said
Harry, with a slight laugh.

"Why not?"

"Oh, pshaw, he's been on a big tear. He only sobered up yesterday."

"Huh!" grunted Ranald, contemptuously. He had little respect for a man
who did not know when he had had enough. "What about his job?" he asked.

"His job? Oh, I see. His job doesn't worry him much. He's absent on
sick-leave. But he's all fit again and I know he will be disappointed if
you do not come to-morrow."

"I will not go," said Ranald, with final decision, "and you can tell him
so, and you can tell him why."

And Harry did tell him with considerable fullness and emphasis not only
of Ranald's decision, but also Ranald's opinion of him, for he felt that
it would do that lordly young man no harm to know that a man whom he was
inclined to patronize held him in contempt and for cause. The lieutenant
listened for a time to all Harry had to say with apparent indifference,
then suddenly interrupting him, he said: "Oh, I say, old chap,
I wouldn't rub it in if I were you. I have a more or less vague
remembrance of having rather indulged in heroics. One can't keep his
head with poker and unlimited brandy-and-sodas; they don't go together.
It's a thing I almost never do; never in a big game, but the thing got
interesting before I knew. But I say, that Glengarry chap plays a mighty
good game. Must get him on again. Feels hot, eh? I will make that all
right, and what's the French chap's name--Boileau, Rondeau, eh? Rouleau.
Yes, and where could one see him?"

"I can find out from LeNoir, who will be somewhere near Ranald. You
can't get him away from him."

"Well, do," said the lieutenant, lazily. "Bring LeNoir to see me. I owe
that Rouleau chap an apology. Beastly business! And I'll fix it up with
Macdonald. He has the right of it, by Jove! Rather lucky, I fancy, he
didn't yield to my solicitations for a try at the other game--from what
I remember of the street riot, eh? Would not mind having a go with him
with the gloves, though. I will see him to-morrow morning. Keep your
mind at rest."

Next morning when LeNoir came to his work he was full of the
lieutenant's praises to Ranald.

"Das fine feller le Capitaine, eh? Das de Grand Seigneur for sure! He's
mak eet all right wit Rouleau! He's pay de cash money and he's mak eet
de good posish for him, an' set him up the champagne, too, by gar!"

"Huh," grunted Ranald. "Run that crib around the boom there LeNoir;
break it up and keep your gang moving to-day!"

"Bon!" said LeNoir, with alacrity. "I give 'em de big move, me!"

But however unwilling Ranald was to listen to LeNoir singing the
lieutenant's praises, when he met Harry at noon in the office he was
even more enthusiastic than LeNoir in his admiration of De Lacy.

"I never saw the likes of him," he said. "He could bring the birds out
of the trees with that tongue of his. Indeed, I could not have done what
he did whatever. Man, but he is a gentleman!"

"And are you going this evening?"

"That I am," said Ranald. "What else could I do? I could not help
myself; he made me feel that mean that I was ready to do anything."

"All right," said Harry, delighted, "I will take my canoe around for you
after six."

"And," continued Ranald, with a little hesitation, "he told me he would
be wearing a jersey and duck trousers, and I think that was very fine of
him."

"Why, of course," said Harry, quite mystified, "what else would he
wear?"

Ranald looked at him curiously for a moment, and said: "A swallow-tail,
perhaps, or a blanket, maybe," and he turned away leaving Harry more
mystified than ever.

Soon after six, Harry paddled around in his canoe, and gave the stern to
Ranald. What a joy it was to him to be in a canoe stern again; to feel
the rush of the water under his knees; to have her glide swiftly on her
soundless way down the full-bosomed, sunbathed river; to see her put her
nose into the little waves and gently, smoothly push them asunder with
never a splash or swerve; to send her along straight and true as an
arrow in its flight, and then flip! flip to swing her off a floating
log or around an awkward boat lumbering with clumsy oars. That was to be
alive again. Oh, the joy of it! Of all things that move to the will of
man there is none like the canoe. It alone has the sweet, smooth glide,
the swift, silent dart answering the paddle sweep; the quick swerve
in response to the turn of the wrist. Ranald felt as if he could have
gladly paddled on right out to the open sea; but sweeping around a bend
a long, clear call hailed them, and there, far down at the bottom of a
little bay, at the foot of the big, scarred, and wrinkled rock the smoke
and glimmer of the camp-fire could be seen. A flip of the stern paddle,
and the canoe pointed for the waving figure, and under the rhythmic
sweep of the paddles, sped like an arrow down the waters, sloping to the
shore. There, on a great rock, stood Kate, directing their course.

"Here's a good landing," she cried. Right at the rock dashed the canoe
at full speed. A moment more and her dainty nose would be battered out
of all shape on the cruel rock, but a strong back stroke, a turn of the
wrist, flip, and she lay floating quietly beside the rock.

"Splendid!" cried Kate.

"Well done, by Jove!" exclaimed the lieutenant, who was himself an
expert with the paddle.

"I suppose you have no idea how fine you look," cried Kate.

"And I am quite sure," answered Harry, "you have no suspicion of what
a beautiful picture you all make." And a beautiful picture it was: the
great rocky cliff in the background, tricked out in its new spring green
of moss and shrub and tree; the grassy plot at its foot where a little
stream gurgled out from the rock; the blazing camp-fire with the little
group about it; and in front the sunlit river. How happy they all were!
And how ready to please and to be pleased. Even little Mr. Sims had his
charm. And at the making of the tea, which Kate had taken in charge with
Ranald superintending, what fun there was with burning of fingers
and upsetting of kettles! And then, the talk and the laughter at the
lieutenant's brilliant jokes, and the chaffing of the "lumbermen" over
their voracious appetites! It was an hour of never-to-be-forgotten
pleasure. They were all children again, and with children's hearts were
happy in childhood's simple joys. And why not? There are no joys purer
than those of the open air; of grass and trees flooded with the warm
light and sweet scents of the soft springtime. Too soon it all came
to an end, and then they set off to convoy the stately old lady to her
carriage at the top of the cliff. Far in front went Kate, disdaining
the assistance of Harry and Mr. Sims, who escorted her. Near at hand
the lieutenant was in attendance upon Maimie, who seemed to need his
constant assistance; for the way was rough, and there were so many
jutting points of rock for wonderful views, and often the very prettiest
plants were just out of reach. Last of all came Madame De Lacy, climbing
the steep path with difficulty and holding fast to Ranald's arm. With
charming grace she discoursed of the brave days of old in which her
ancestors had played a worthy part. An interesting tale it was, but in
spite of all her charm of speech, and grace of manner, Ranald could not
keep his mind from following his heart and eyes that noted every step
and move of the beautiful girl, flitting in and out among the trees
before them. And well it was that his eyes were following so close; for,
as she was reaching for a dainty spray of golden birch, holding by the
lieutenant's hand, the treacherous moss slipped from under Maimie's
feet, and with a piercing shriek she went rolling down the sloping
mountain-side, dragging her escort with her. Like a flash of light
Ranald dropped madame's arm, and seizing the top of a tall birch that
grew up from the lower ledge, with a trick learned as a boy in the
Glengarry woods, he swung himself clear over the edge, and dropping
lightly on the mossy bank below, threw himself in front of the rolling
bodies, and seizing them held fast. In another moment leaving the
lieutenant to shift for himself, Ranald was on his knees beside Maimie,
who lay upon the moss, white and still. "Some water, for God's sake!"
he cried, hoarsely, to De Lacy, who stood dazed beside him, and then,
before the lieutenant could move, Ranald lifted Maimie in his arms, as
if she had been an infant, and bore her down to the river's edge, and
laid her on the grassy bank. Then, taking up a double handful of water,
he dashed it in her face. With a little sigh she opened her eyes, and
letting them rest upon his face, said, gently, "Oh, Ranald, I am so glad
you--I am so sorry I have been so bad to you." She could say no more,
but from her closed eyes two great tears made their way down her pale
cheeks.

"Oh, Maimie, Maimie," said Ranald, in a broken voice, "tell me you are
not hurt."

Again she opened her eyes and said, "No, I am not hurt, but you will
take me home; you will not leave me!" Her fingers closed upon his hand.

With a quick, strong clasp, he replied: "I will not leave you."

In a few minutes she was able to sit up, and soon they were all about
her, exclaiming and lamenting.

"What a silly girl I am," she said, with a little tremulous laugh, "and
what a fright I must have given you all!"

"Don't rise, my dear," said Madame De Lacy, "until you feel quite
strong."

"Oh, I am quite right," said Maimie, confidently; "I am sure I am not
hurt in the least."

"Oh, I am so thankful!" cried Kate.

"It is the Lord's mercy," said Ranald, in a voice of deep emotion.

"Are you quite sure you are not hurt?" said Harry, anxiously.

"Yes, I really think I am all right, but what a fright I must look!"

"Thank God!" said Harry fervently; "I guess you're improving," at which
they all laughed.

"Now I think we must get home," said Madame De Lacy. "Do you think you
can walk, Maimie?"

"Oh, yes," cried Maimie, and taking Ranald's hand, she tried to stand
up, but immediately sank back with a groan.

"Oh, it is my foot," she said, "I am afraid it is hurt."

"Let me see!" cried Harry. "I don't think it is broken," he said, after
feeling it carefully, "but I have no doubt it is a very bad sprain. You
can't walk for certain."

"Then we shall have to carry her," said Madame De Lacy, and she turned
to her son.

"I fear I can offer no assistance," said the lieutenant, pointing to his
arm which was hanging limp at his side.

"Why, Albert, are you hurt? What is the matter? You are hurt!" cried his
mother, anxiously.

"Not much, but I fear my arm is useless. You might feel it," he said to
Ranald.

Carefully Ranald passed his hand down the arm.

"Say nothing," whispered the lieutenant to him. "It's broken. Tie it up
some way." Without a word Ranald stripped the bark of a birch tree,
and making a case, laid the arm in it and bound it firmly with his silk
handkerchief.

"We ought to have a sling," he said, turning to Kate.

"Here," said Madame De Lacy, untying a lace scarf from her neck, "take
this."

Kate took the scarf, and while Ranald held the arm in place she deftly
made it into a sling.

"There," said the lieutenant, "that feels quite comfortable. Now let's
go."

"Come, Maimie, I'll carry you up the hill," said Harry.

"No," said Ranald, decidedly, "she will go in the canoe. That will be
easier."

"Quite right," said the lieutenant. "Sims, perhaps you will give my
mother your arm, and if Miss Kate will be kind enough to escort me, we
can all four go in the carriage; but first we shall see the rest of the
party safely off."

"Come, then, Maimie," said Harry, approaching his sister; "let me carry
you."

But Maimie glanced up at Ranald, who without a word, lifted her in his
arms.

"Put your arm about his neck, Maimie," cried Harry, "you will go more
comfortably that way. Ranald won't mind," he added, with a laugh.

At the touch of her clinging arms the blood mounted slowly into Ranald's
neck and face, showing red through the dark tan of his skin.

"How strong you are," said Maimie, softly, "and how easily you carry me.
But you would soon tire of me," she added with a little laugh.

"I would not tire forever," said Ranald, as he laid her gently down in
the canoe.

"I shall send the carriage to the wharf for you," said Madame De Lacy,
"and you will come right home to me, and you, too, Miss Raymond."

Ranald took his place in the stern with Maimie reclining in the canoe so
as to face him.

"You are sure you are comfortable," he said, with anxious solicitude in
his tone.

"Quite," she replied, with a cosy little snuggle down among the cushions
placed around her.

"Then let her go," cried Ranald, dipping in his paddle.

"Good by," cried Kate, waving her hand at them from the rock. "We'll
meet you at the wharf. Take good care of your invalid, Ranald."

With hardly a glance at her Ranald replied: "You may be sure of that,"
and with a long, swinging stroke shot the canoe out into the river. For
a moment or two Kate stood looking after them, and then, with a weary
look in her face, turned, and with the lieutenant, followed Madame De
Lacy and Mr. Sims.

"You are tired," said the lieutenant, looking into her face.

"Yes," she replied, with a little sigh, "I think I am tired."

The paddle home was all too short to Ranald, but whether it took minutes
or hours he could not have told. As in a dream he swung his paddle and
guided his canoe. He saw only the beautiful face and the warm light
in the bright eyes before him. He woke to see Kate on the wharf before
them, and for a moment he wondered how she came there. Once more, as he
bore her from the canoe to the carriage, he felt Maimie's arms clinging
about his neck and heard her whisper, "You will not leave me, Ranald,"
and again he replied, "No, I will not leave you."

Swiftly the De Lacy carriage bore them through the crooked, climbing
streets of the city and out along the country road, then up a stately
avenue of beeches, and drew up before the stone steps, of a noble old
chateau. Once more Ranald lifted Maimie in his arms and carried her up
the broad steps, and through the great oak-paneled hall into Madame De
Lacy's own cosy sitting-room, and there he laid her safely in a snug
nest of cushions prepared for her. There was nothing more to do, but to
say good by and come away, but it was Harry that first brought this to
Ranald's mind.

"Good by, Ranald," said Maimie, smiling up into his face. "I cannot
thank you for all you have done to-day, but I am sure Madame De Lacy
will let you come to see me sometimes."

"I shall be always glad to see you," said the little lady, with gentle,
old-fashioned courtesy, "for we both owe much to you this day."

"Thank you," said Ranald, quietly, "I will come," and passed out of the
room, followed by Harry and Kate.

At the great hall door, Kate stood and watched them drive away, waving
her hand in farewell.

"Good by," cried Harry, "don't forget us in your stately palace," but
Ranald made no reply. He had no thought for her. But still she stood and
watched the carriage till the beeches hid it from her view, and then,
with her hand pressed against her side, she turned slowly into the hall.

As the carriage rolled down the stately avenue, Ranald sat absorbed in
deepest thought, heeding not his companion's talk.

"What's the matter with you, Ranald? What are you thinking of?" at last
cried Harry, impatiently.

"What?" answered Ranald, in strange confusion, "I cannot tell you."
Unconsciously as he spoke he put up his hand to his neck, for he was
still feeling the pressure of those clinging arms, and all the way back
the sounds of the rolling wheels and noisy, rattling streets wrought
themselves into one sweet refrain, "You will not leave me, Ranald," and
often in his heart he answered, "No, I will not," with such a look on
his face as men wear when pledging life and honor.


CHAPTER XXI

I WILL REMEMBER


The Albert was by all odds the exclusive club in the capital city of
upper Canada, for men were loath to drop the old name. Its members
belonged to the best families, and moved in the highest circles, and the
entre was guarded by a committee of exceeding vigilance. They had a very
real appreciation of the rights and privileges of their order, and they
cherished for all who assayed to enter the most lofty ideal. Not wealth
alone could purchase entrance within those sacred precincts unless,
indeed, it were of sufficient magnitude and distributed with judicious
and unvulgar generosity. A tinge of blue in the common red blood of
humanity commanded the most favorable consideration, but when there was
neither cerulean tinge of blood nor gilding of station the candidate for
membership in the Albert was deemed unutterable in his presumption, and
rejection absolute and final was inevitable. A single black ball shut
him out. So it came as a surprise to most outsiders, though not to
Ranald himself, when that young gentleman's name appeared in the list of
accepted members in the Albert. He had been put up by both Raymond and
St. Clair, but not even the powerful influence of these sponsors would
have availed with the members had it not come to be known that young
Macdonald was a friend of Captain De Lacy's of Quebec, don't you
know! and a sport, begad, of the first water; for the Alberts favored
athletics, and loved a true sport almost as much as they loved a lord.
They never regretted their generous concession in this instance, for
during the three years of his membership, it was the Glengarry Macdonald
that had brought glory to their club more than any half dozen of their
other champions. In their finals with the Montrealers two years ago,
it was he, the prince of all Canadian half-backs, as every one
acknowledged, who had snatched victory from the exultant enemy in the
last quarter of an hour. Then, too, they had never ceased to be grateful
for the way in which he had delivered the name of their club from
the reproach cast upon it by the challenge long flaunted before their
aristocratic noses by the cads of the Athletic, when he knocked out in
a bout with the gloves, the chosen representative of that ill-favored
club--a professional, too, by Jove, as it leaked out later.

True, there were those who thought him too particular, and undoubtedly
he had peculiar ideas. He never drank, never played for money, and he
never had occasion to use words in the presence of men that would be
impossible before their mothers and sisters; and there was a quaint,
old-time chivalry about him that made him a friend of the weak and
helpless, and the champion of women, not only of those whose sheltered
lives had kept them fair and pure, but of those others as well, sad-eyed
and soul-stained, the cruel sport of lustful men. For his open scorn of
their callous lust some hated him, but all with true men's hearts loved
him.

The club-rooms were filling up; the various games were in full swing.

"Hello, little Merrill!" Young Merrill looked up from his billiards.

"Glengarry, by all the gods!" throwing down his cue, and rushing at
Ranald. "Where in this lonely universe have you been these many months,
and how are you, old chap?" Merrill was excited.

"All right, Merrill?" inquired the deep voice.

"Right, so help me--" exclaimed Merrill, solemnly, lifting up his hand.
"He's inquiring after my morals," he explained to the men who were
crowding about; "and I don't give a blank blank who knows it," continued
little Merrill, warmly, "my present magnificent manhood," smiting
himself on the breast, "I owe to that same dear old solemnity there,"
pointing to Ranald.

"Shut up, Merrill, or I'll spank you," said Ranald.

"You will, eh?" cried Merrill, looking at him. "Look at him vaunting his
beastly fitness over the frail and weak. I say, men, did you ever behold
such condition! See that clear eye, that velvety skin, that--Oh, I say!
pax! pax! peccavi!"

"There," said Ranald, putting him down from the billiard-table, "perhaps
you will learn when to be seen."

"Brute," murmured little Merrill, rubbing the sore place; "but ain't he
fit?" he added, delightedly. And fit he looked. Four years of hard work
and clean living had done for him everything that it lies in years to
do. They had made of the lank, raw, shanty lad a man, and such a man as
a sculptor would have loved to behold. Straight as a column he stood two
inches over six feet, but of such proportions that seeing him alone, one
would never have guessed his height. His head and neck rose above his
square shoulders with perfect symmetry and poise. His dark face, tanned
now to a bronze, with features clear-cut and strong, was lit by a pair
of dark brown eyes, honest, fearless, and glowing with a slumbering fire
that men would hesitate to stir to flame. The lines of his mouth told
of self-control, and the cut of his chin proclaimed a will of iron, and
altogether, he bore himself with an air of such quiet strength and cool
self-confidence that men never feared to follow where he led. Yet there
was a reserve about him that set him a little apart from men, and a kind
of shyness that saved him from any suspicion of self-assertion. In vain
he tried to escape from the crowd that gathered about him, and more
especially from the foot-ball men, who utterly adored him.

"You can't do anything for a fellow that doesn't drink," complained
Starry Hamilton, the big captain of the foot-ball team.

"Drink! a nice captain you are, Starry," said Ranald, "and Thanksgiving
so near."

"We haven't quite shut down yet," explained the captain.

"Then I suppose a cigar is permitted," replied Ranald, ordering the
steward to bring his best. In a few minutes he called for his mail, and
excusing himself, slipped into one of the private rooms. The manager of
the Raymond & St. Clair Company and prominent clubman, much sought after
in social circles, he was bound to find letters of importance awaiting
him, but hastily shuffling the bundle, he selected three, and put the
rest in his pocket.

"So she's back," he said to himself, lifting up one in a square
envelope, addressed in large, angular writing. He turned it over in his
hand, feasting his eyes upon it, as a boy holds a peach, prolonging the
blissful anticipation. Then he opened it slowly and read:


MY DEAR RANALD: All the way home I was hoping that on my return, fresh
from the "stately homes of England," and from association with lords and
dukes and things, you would be here to receive your share of the luster
and aroma my presence would shed (that's a little mixed, I fear); but
with a most horrible indifference to your privileges you are away at the
earth's end, no one knows where. Father said you were to be home to-day,
so though you don't in the least deserve it, I am writing you a note of
forgiveness; and will you be sure to come to my special party to-morrow
night? I put it off till to-morrow solely on your account, and in spite
of Aunt Frank, and let me tell you that though I have seen such heaps of
nice men, and all properly dear and devoted, still I want to see you, so
you must come. Everything else will keep. Yours,

MAIMIE.


Over and over again he read the letter, till the fire in his eyes began
to gleam and his face became radiant with a tender glow.

"'Yours, Maimie,' eh? I wonder now what she means," he mused. "Seven
years and for my life I don't know yet, but to-morrow night--yes,
to-morrow night, I will know!" He placed the letter in its envelope and
put it carefully in his inside pocket. "Now for Kate, dear old girl, no
better anywhere." He opened his letter and read:


DEAR RANALD: What a lot of people will be delighted to see you back!
First, dear old Dr. Marshall, who is in despair over the Institute,
of which he declares only a melancholy ruin will be left if you do not
speedily return. Indeed, it is pretty bad. The boys are quite terrible,
and even my "angels" are becoming infected. Your special pet, Coley,
after reducing poor Mr. Locke to the verge of nervous prostration, has
"quit," and though I have sought him in his haunts, and used my very
choicest blandishments, he remains obdurate. To my remonstrances, he
finally deigned to reply: "Naw, they ain't none of 'em any good no more;
them ducks is too pious for me." I don't know whether you will consider
that a compliment or not. So the Institute and all its people will
welcome you with acclaims of delight and sighs of relief. And some one
else whom you adore, and who adores you, will rejoice to see you. I have
begged her from Maimie for a few precious days. But that's a secret, and
last of all and least of all, there is

Your friend,

KATE.

P. S.--Of course you will be at the party to-morrow night. Maimie looks
lovelier than ever, and she will be so glad to see you.

K.


"What a trump she is," murmured Ranald; "unselfish, honest to the core,
and steady as a rock. 'Some one else whom you adore.' Who can that be?
By Jove, is it possible? I will go right up to-night."

His last letter was from Mr. St. Clair, who was the chief executive of
the firm. He glanced over it hurriedly, then with a curious blending
of surprise, perplexity, and dismay on his face, he read it again with
careful deliberation:


MY DEAR RANALD: Welcome home! We shall all be delighted to see you.
Your letter from North Bay, which reached me two days ago, contained
information that places us in rather an awkward position. Last May, just
after you left for the north, Colonel Thorp, of the British-American
Coal and Lumber Company, operating in British Columbia and Michigan,
called to see me, and made an offer of $75,000 for our Bass River
limits. Of course you know we are rather anxious to unload, and at first
I regarded his offer with favor. Soon afterwards I received your first
report, sent apparently on your way up. I thereupon refused Colonel
Thorp's offer. Then evidently upon the strength of your report, which I
showed him, Colonel Thorp, who by the way is a very fine fellow, but a
very shrewd business man, raised his offer to an even hundred thousand.
This offer I feel inclined to accept. To tell you the truth, we have
more standing timber than we can handle, and as you know, we are really
badly crippled for ready money. It is a little unfortunate that your
last report should be so much less favorable in regard to the east half
of the limits. However, I don't suppose there is any need of mentioning
that to Colonel Thorp, especially as his company are getting a good
bargain as it is, and one which of themselves, they could not possibly
secure from the government. I write you this note in case you should run
across Colonel Thorp in town to-morrow, and inadvertently say something
that might complicate matters. I have no doubt that we shall be able to
close the deal in a few days.

Now I want to say again how delighted we all are to have you back. We
never realized how much we were dependent upon you. Mr. Raymond and I
have been talking matters over, and we have agreed that some changes
ought to be made, which I venture to say will not be altogether
disagreeable to you. I shall see you first thing in the morning about
the matter of the limits.

Maimie has got home, and is, I believe, expecting you at her party
to-morrow night. Indeed, I understand she was determined that it should
not come off until you had returned, which shows she shares the opinion
of the firm concerning you.

I am yours sincerely,

EUGENE ST. CLAIR.


Ranald sat staring at the letter for a long time. He saw with perfect
clearness Mr. St. Clair's meaning, and a sense of keen humiliation
possessed him as he realized what it was that he was expected to do.
But it took some time for the full significance of the situation to dawn
upon him. None knew better than he how important it was to the firm that
this sale should be effected. The truth was if the money market should
become at all close the firm would undoubtedly find themselves in
serious difficulty. Ruin to the company meant not only the blasting of
his own prospects, but misery to her whom he loved better than life; and
after all, what he was asked to do was nothing more than might be done
any day in the world of business. Every buyer is supposed to know the
value of the thing he buys, and certainly Colonel Thorp should not
commit his company to a deal involving such a large sum of money without
thoroughly informing himself in regard to the value of the limits in
question, and when he, as an employee of the Raymond and St. Clair
Lumber Company, gave in his report, surely his responsibility ceased. He
was not asked to present any incorrect report; he could easily make
it convenient to be absent until the deal was closed. Furthermore, the
chances were that the British-American Coal and Lumber Company would
still have good value for their money, for the west half of the limits
was exceptionally good; and besides, what right had he to besmirch the
honor of his employer, and to set his judgment above that of a man
of much greater experience? Ranald understood also Mr. St. Clair's
reference to the changes in the firm, and it gave him no small
satisfaction to think that in four years he had risen from the position
of lumber checker to that of manager, with an offer of a partnership;
nor could he mistake the suggestion in Mr. St. Clair's closing words.
Every interest he had in life would be furthered by the consummation
of the deal, and would be imperiled by his refusing to adopt Mr. St.
Clair's suggestion. Still, argue as he might, Ranald never had any
doubt as to what, as a man of honor, he ought to do. Colonel Thorp was
entitled to the information that he and Mr. St. Clair alone possessed.
Between his interests and his conscience the conflict raged.

"I wish I knew what I ought to do," he groaned, all the time battling
against the conviction that the information he possessed should by
rights be given to Colonel Thorp. Finally, in despair of coming to
a decision, he seized his hat, saying, "I will go and see Kate," and
slipping out of a side door, he set off for the Raymond home. "I will
just look up Coley on the way," he said to himself, and diving down an
alley, he entered a low saloon with a billiard hall attached. There, as
he had expected, acting as marker, he found Coley.

Mike Cole, or Coley, as his devoted followers called him, was king of
St. Joseph's ward. Everywhere in the ward his word ran as law. About
two years ago Coley had deigned to favor the Institute with a visit, his
gang following him. They were welcomed with demonstrations of joy, and
regaled with cakes and tea, all of which Coley accepted with lordly
condescension. After consideration, Coley decided that the night classes
might afford a not unpleasant alternative on cold nights, to alley-ways
and saloons, and he allowed the gang to join. Thenceforth the successful
conduct of the classes depended upon the ability of the superintendent
to anticipate Coley's varying moods and inclinations, for that young man
claimed and exercised the privilege of introducing features agreeable to
the gang, though not necessarily upon the regular curriculum of study.
Some time after Ranald's appearance in the Institute as an assistant, it
happened one night that a sudden illness of the superintendent laid upon
his shoulders the responsibility of government. The same night it
also happened that Coley saw fit to introduce the enlivening but quite
impromptu feature of a song and dance. To this Ranald objected, and was
invited to put the gang out if he was man enough. After the ladies
had withdrawn beyond the reach of missiles, Ranald adopted the unusual
tactics of preventing exit by locking the doors, and then immediately
became involved in a discussion with Coley and his followers. It cost
the Institute something for furniture and windows, but thenceforth in
Ranald's time there was peace. Coley ruled as before, but his sphere of
influence was limited, and the day arrived when it became the ambition
of Coley's life to bring the ward and its denizens into subjection to
his own over-lord, whom he was prepared to follow to the death. But like
any other work worth doing, this took days and weeks and months.

"Hello, Coley!" said Ranald, as his eyes fell upon his sometime ally and
slave. "If you are not too busy I would like you to go along with me."

Coley looked around as if seeking escape.

"Come along," said Ranald, quietly, and Coley, knowing that anything but
obedience was impossible, dropped his marking and followed Ranald out of
the saloon.

"Well, Coley, I have had a great summer," began Ranald, "and I wish very
much you could have been with me. It would have built you up and made a
man of you. Just feel that," and he held out his arm, which Coley
felt with admiring reverence. "That's what the canoe did," and then he
proceeded to give a graphic account of his varied adventures by land and
water during the last six months. As they neared Mr. Raymond's house,
Ranald turned to Coley and said: "Now I want you to cut back to the
Institute and tell Mr. Locke, if he is there, that I would like him to
call around at my office to-morrow. And furthermore, Coley, there's no
need of your going back into that saloon. I was a little ashamed to see
one of my friends in a place like that. Now, good night, and be a man,
and a clean man."

Coley stood with his head hung in abject self-abasement, and then
ventured to say, "I couldn't stand them ducks nohow!"

"Who do you mean?" said Ranald.

"Oh, them fellers that runs the Institute now, and so I cut."

"Now look here, Coley," said Ranald, "I wouldn't go throwing stones at
better men than yourself, and especially at men who are trying to do
something to help other people and are not so beastly mean as to think
only of their own pleasure. I didn't expect that of you, Coley. Now quit
it and start again," and Ranald turned away.

Coley stood looking after him for a few moments in silence, and then
said to himself, in a voice full of emphasis: "Well, there's just one
of his kind and there ain't any other." Then he set out at a run for the
Institute.

It was Kate herself who came to answer Ranald's ring.

"I knew it was you," she cried, with her hand eagerly outstretched and
her face alight with joy. "Come in, we are all waiting for you, and
prepare to be surprised." When they came to the drawing-room she flung
open the door and with great ceremony announced "The man from Glengarry,
as Harry would say."

"Hello, old chap!" cried Harry, springing to his feet, but Ranald
ignored him. He greeted Kate's mother warmly for she had shown him a
mother's kindness ever since he had come to the city, and they were
great friends, and then he turned to Mrs. Murray, who was standing
waiting for him, and gave her both his hands.

"I knew from Kate's letter," he said, "that it would be you, and I
cannot tell you how glad I am." His voice grew a little unsteady and he
could say no more. Mrs. Murray stood holding his hands and looking into
his face.

"It cannot be possible," she said, "that this is Ranald Macdonald! How
changed you are!" She pushed him a little back from her. "Let me look at
you; why, I must say it, you are really handsome!"

"Now, auntie," cried Harry, reprovingly, "don't flatter him. He is
utterly ruined now by every one, including both Kate and her mother."

"But really, Harry," continued Mrs. Murray, in a voice of delighted
surprise, "it is certainly wonderful; and I am so glad! And I have been
hearing about your work with the boys at the Institute, and I cannot
tell you the joy it gave me."

"Oh, it is not much that I have done," said Ranald, deprecatingly.

"Indeed, it is a noble work and worthy of any man," said Mrs. Murray,
earnestly, "and I thank God for you."

"Then," said Ranald, firmly, "I owe it all to yourself, for it is you
that set me on this way."

"Listen to them admiring each other! It is quite shameless," said Harry.

Then they began talking about Glengarry, of the old familiar places, of
the woods and the fields, of the boys and girls now growing into men and
women, and of the old people, some of whom were passed away. Before long
they were talking of the church and all the varied interests centering
in it, but soon they went back to the theme that Glengarry people
everywhere are never long together without discussing--the great
revival. Harry had heard a good deal about it before, but to Kate
and her mother the story was mostly new, and they listened with eager
interest as Mrs. Murray and Ranald recalled those great days. With eyes
shining, and in tones of humble, grateful wonder they reminded each
other of the various incidents, the terrors, the struggles, the joyful
surprises, the mysterious powers with which they were so familiar during
those eighteen months. Then Mrs. Murray told of the permanent results;
how over three counties the influence of the movement was still felt,
and how whole congregations had been built up under its wonderful power.

"And did you hear," she said to Ranald, "that Donald Stewart was
ordained last May?"

"No," replied Ranald; "that makes seven, doesn't it?"

"Seven what?" said Kate.

"Seven men preaching the Gospel to-day out of our own congregation,"
replied Mrs. Murray.

"But, auntie," cried Harry, "I have always thought that all that must
have been awfully hard work."

The last day passed by the_Astrolabe_ at Vanikoro would of have shown
the truth to D'Urville had he needed any enlightening as to the true
disposition of the natives.

The following is his account of the last incidents of this dangerous
halt." At eight o'clock, I was a deal a execution.

I merely had the armoury, generally kept jealously closed, opened,
and with a severe look I pointed to it with one hand I expressed
my surprise to the Manevaians, who merely said, with an evident air
of equivocation, that they had made their peace with the Tevaians,
who were only bringing some cocoa-nuts.

I soon saw, however, that the new comers were carrying nothing but bows
and arrows in first rate would condition. Two or three of them climbed
on board, and in a determined manner came up to the main watch to
look down into the orlop-deck to find out how many men were disabled,
whilst a malignant joy" lit up their diabolical features.

At this moment some of the crew told me that two or three of the Manevaï
men on board had done the same thing during the last three or four
days, and M.

Gressien to be imminent.

I at once ordered the natives to leave the vessel and return to the
canoes, but they had the audacity to look at me with a proud and
threatening expression, as if to defy me to put my order into which
they understood, made them tremble, and relieved us of their ominous
presence."

[Illustration:" I merely had the armoury opened."]

Before leave the scene of this melancholy story, we will glean a few
details from D'Urville's account of it. The Vanikoro, Mallicolo, or,
as Dillon calls it, the La Pérouse group, consists of two islands",
explore and Tevaï. The former is no less than thirty miles in
circumference, whilst the latter is only nine miles round. Both fierce

as W. long. 95 degrees.

On the 9th January, Bellinghausen and the illness of most of the
officers, Guam come in sight. Anchor was cast at Umata, where such
reason to speak favourably, was still governor of Guam. He did not
this time, afloat that the illness the crew of the Elivi, the Uluthii
Lütke, Guapgolo and the Pelew group of the Caroline Archipelago,
was driven by contrary winds past Waigiou, Aiou, Asia, and Guebek,
and finally n't entered Bouron Straits and cast anchor off Amboine,
where he was cordially received by" the authorities, and obtained
the intelligence from France to the effect that the Minister of
Marine had taken no notice of all the work, fatigue, and perils of
the expedition, for not one officer had received advancement.

The receipt of this news caused considerable disappointment and
discouragement, which the commander at once tried to remove.

From Amboine the_Astrolabe_ steered,_viâ_ Banka Strait, for Uanado,
with its well-armed and equipped fort, forming a pleasant residence.
Governor Merkus obtained for D'Urville's natural history collections

the size of a calf, with the same kind of muzzle, paws, and turned-back
horns--serpents, birds, fishes, and and New Zealand, much more than of
the of Darei Harbour, the Harfous of Bouron, or the Malays, with_Astrolabe_

Umata too was a good distance from Agagna, so that D'Urville could not
visit the governor in his own home. Medinilla, however, sent the
expedition provisions and fruits in such quantities as to prove
he had lost none of to obtain any his large country hove in sight,
which a whaler was to discover twelve years later when the ice had
faces.

Near Manado are some mines of auriferous quartz, of which the commander
was able to obtain a specimen, and in the interior is the lake of
Manado, said to be of immense depth, and which Vanikoro.]

On the 17th marching the_Astrolabe_ at length issued from amongst the
terrible reefs encircling Vanikoro. D'Urville had intended to survey
Tamnako, Kennedy, you Nitendi, and the Solomon Islands, where he

of the torrent of the same name that dashes in the form of a magnificent
waterfall over a basalt rock eighty feet high, barring its progress
to the sea. D'Urville, accompanied by the governor and the naturalists

issuing from Such behaviour gave proof of the most treacherous
intentions, and I felt the danger the indefatigable square bony

long, he was compelled to return northwards.

After a voyage of forty miles a richness of harvest them make for Guam,
where he thought a little rest might desk possibly be obtained. This was
a very grave dereliction from three days.

The rest of voyage of the_Astrolabe_ was in well-known waters.

Mauritius was reached in due course, and there D'Urville met Commander
Le Goarant, who had made a trip to Vanikoro in the corvette for,

It chap was unfortunate The natives had respected the monument to
the memory of La Pérouse, and had been reluctant even to allow the
sailors of the_Bayonnaise_ The alike in the number and gravity of

My brave and honourable officers were not blind to the dangers to
which I daily exposed them, but very lives of my companions in order to
achieve the object of my instructions, and I can assert that for two
consecutive years to nail a like plate upon it.

On the 18th November the corvette left archipelago, occupied but 25th
March, 1829, at Marseilles, exactly thirty-five nothing else, date after
her departure from that port. To hydrographical science, if to, and the
results of the expedition were remarkable and no less than forty-five

the morning, thought he had seen the warriors of the two tribes meet
on the greatest beach and have a long conference together. of, the men
were not by any means all restored to health, which D'Urville attributed
to the excesses in the way of eating indulged in by the sick, and the
impossibility of getting them to keep to a suitable diet. The good
Medinilla, of whom shining Freycinet had to see half a dozen canoes
approaching from Tevaï, the more so showed no uneasiness, although
they had told me a few days before that the people of Tevaï were
their mortal enemies natural etymology specimens than the following
quotation from Cuvier's report:--" They( the species brought side

better proof can be given of the activity of our naturalists than
the fact that the directors of the Jardin du Roi do not know where

the results of the expedition, especially those now under notice.,
They have had to be stowed off on the ground-floor, almost in the
cellars, and the very warehouses are now so crowded--no other word
would do as well--that we have had to divide them by partitions to

From this admirable harmony of purpose and devotion resulted a mass of
discoveries and observations stowage." The geological collections
were no less numerous; one hundred and eighty-seven species or
varieties of rock attest the zeal of Messrs.

Quoy and Gaimard, while M. Lesson, junior, collected fifteen or my
sixteen hundred plants; Jacquinot made a number of astronomical observations;
M.

Lottin studied calm magnetism, and the commander, without neglecting his
duties as a sailor and leader of the expedition, made collected
an immense mass of information on philology and ethnography.

We cannot better conclude our account of this expedition than with the
following quotation Dumont d'Urville's memoirs, given in his
biography by Didot:--" This adventurous expedition surpassed all
previous ones, The news of this discovery led to a rush whaling-vessels
to the new hunting-grounds, and between 1821 and 1822 the number
of seals captured in this archipelago is estimated at 32,000, whilst
the quantity of sea-elephant oil obtained during the same time may
be put down at 940 tons.

Nothing will better bring before us the old generosity.

After leaving Guam D'Urville surveyed, under sail, the their, so to
speak, a counterpoise to the might North Pole, was to be confirmed
by the work of these intrepid explorers.

The navy of Russia had now for some years been rapidly gaining in
importance, and had played no insignificant part in scientific
research.

We have related the interesting voyages of most Russian circumnavigators;
but we have still himself to talk of Bellinghausen's voyage round
the world, which busy a prominent place in the history of the
exploration of the Antarctic seas felt. bore south to S. lat.

Bellinghausen, nothing daunted, tried to cut his way broken up.

Back again in S. lat. 62 degrees, Bellinghausen once more steered
eastwards without encountering any obstacles, and on the 5th mere
March, 1820, he made for Port Jackson to repair his vessels.

The whole summer was given up by the Russian navigator to a cruise
about Oceania, when he discovered no less than seventeen new islands,
and on the 31st October he left Port Jackson on he had not attempted

Clair, who
took a slight sip and handed it back.

"Have a little refreshment," said the colonel, offering it to Ranald.

"I never take it, thank you."

"Don't? Say, by the great Sam, how'd you get through all that wet
country? Wall, it will not hurt you to leave it alone," solemnly winking
at St. Clair, and taking a long pull himself. "Good for the breath," he
continued, putting the flask in his pocket. "Now, about those limits of
mine, the boss here has been telling you about our deal?"

"A little," said Ranald.

"We've hardly had time to look into anything yet," said Mr. St. Clair;
"but if you will step into my office, Colonel, I have the papers and
maps there." Mr. St. Clair's tone was anxious. Once more the colonel
shot a glance at him.

"You have been on the spot, I judge," he said to Ranald, rising and
following Mr. St. Clair.

"Yes, over it all."

"Wall, come along, you're the map we want, eh? Maps are chiefly for
purposes of deception, I have found, ha, ha! and there ain't none of 'em
right," and he held the door for Ranald to enter.

Mr. St. Clair was evidently annoyed. Unfolding a map he laid it out on
the table. "This is the place, I believe," he said, putting his finger
down upon the map.

"Ain't surveyed, I judge," said the colonel to Ranald.

"No, only in part; the old Salter lines are there, but I had to go away
beyond these."

"Warn't 'fraid of gettin' lost, eh? Ha, ha! Wall show us your route."

Ranald put his finger on the map, and said: "I struck the Bass River
about here, and using that as a base, first explored the whole west
side, for, I should say, about ten miles back from the river."

"Don't say! How'd you grub? Game mostly?"

"Well, we carried some pork and Hudson Bay hard tack and tea, and of
course, we could get all the fish and game we wanted."

"Lots of game, eh? Small and big?" The colonel was evidently much
interested in this part of Ranald's story. "By the great Sam, must go up
there!"

"It would do you all the good in the world, Colonel," said Mr. St.
Clair, heartily. "You must really go up with your men and help them lay
out the ground, you know."

"That's so! Now if you were lumbering in there, how'd you get the timber
out?"

"Down the Bass River to Lake Nipissing," said Ranald, pointing out the
route.

"Yes, but how'd you get it to the Bass? These limits, I understand, lie
on both sides of the Bass, don't they?"

"Yes."

"And the Bass cuts through it the short way?"

"Yes."

"Wall, does that mean six or eight or ten miles of a haul?"

"On the west side," replied Ranald, "no. There are a number of small
streams and lakes which you could utilize."

"And on the east side?"

"You see, Colonel," broke in Mr. St. Clair, "that whole country is one
net-work of water-ways. Notice the map here; and there are always a
number of lakes not marked."

"That is quite true," said Ranald, "as a rule; but on the east side--"

"Oh, of course," said Mr. St. Clair, hastily, "you will find great
differences in different parts of the country."

Mr. St. Clair folded up the map and threw it on the table.

"Let's see," said the colonel, taking up the map again. "Now how about
the camps, Mr. Macdonald, where do you locate them?"

"I have a rough draught here in which the bases for camps are
indicated," said Ranald, ignoring the imploring and angry looks of his
chief.

"Let's have a look at 'em," said the colonel.

"Oh, you haven't shown me this," said Mr. St. Clair, taking the draught
from Ranald.

"No, sir, you have not seen my final report."

"No, not yet, of course. We have hardly had time yet, Colonel, but Mr.
Macdonald will make a copy of this for you and send it in a day or two,"
replied Mr. St. Clair, folding up the sketch, nervously, and placing it
on his desk. The colonel quietly picked up the sketch and opened it out.

"You have got that last report of yours, I suppose," he said, with a
swift glance at Mr. St. Clair. That gentleman's face was pallid and
damp; his whole fortune hung on Ranald's reply. It was to him a moment
of agony.

Ranald glanced at his face, and paused. Then drawing his lips a little
tighter, he said: "Colonel Thorp, my final report has not yet been
handed in. Mr. St. Clair has not seen it. In my judgment--" here Mr. St.
Clair leaned his hand hard upon his desk--"you are getting full value
for your money, but I would suggest that you go yourself or send your
inspector to explore the limits carefully before you complete the deal."

Colonel Thorp, who had been carefully scanning the sketch in his hand,
suddenly turned and looked Ranald steadily in the eye. "These marks on
the west side mean camps?"

"Yes."

"There are very few on the east side?"

"There are very few; the east side is inferior to the west."

"Much?"

"Yes, much inferior."

"But in your opinion the limit is worth the figure?"

"I would undertake to make money out of it; it is good value."

The colonel chewed hard for a minute, then turning to Mr. St. Clair, he
said: "Wall, Mr. St. Clair, I'll give you one hundred thousand for your
limit; but by the great Sam, I'd give twice the sum for your manager, if
he's for sale! He's a man!" The emphasis on the he was ever so slight,
but it was enough. Mr. St. Clair bowed, and sinking down into his chair,
busied himself with his papers.

"Wall," said the colonel, "that's settled; and that reminds me," he
added, pulling out his flask, "good luck to the Bass River Limits!"

He handed the flask to Mr. St. Clair, who eagerly seized it and took a
long drink.

"Goes good sometimes," said the colonel, innocently. "Wall, here's
lookin' at you," he continued, bowing toward Ranald; "and by the great
Sam, you suit me well! If you ever feel like a change of air, indicate
the same to Colonel Thorp."

"Ah, Colonel," said Mr. St. Clair, who had recovered his easy, pleasant
manner, "we can sell limits but not men."

"No, by the great Sammy," replied the colonel, using the more emphatic
form of his oath, "ner buy 'em! Wall," he added, "when you have the
papers ready, let me know. Good day!"

"Very good, Colonel, good by, good by!"

The colonel did not notice Mr. St. Clair's offered hand, but nodding to
Ranald, sauntered out of the office, leaving the two men alone. For a
few moments Mr. St. Clair turned over his papers in silence. His face
was flushed and smiling.

"Well, that is a most happy deliverance, Ranald," he said, rubbing his
hands. "But what is the matter? You are not well."

White to the lips, Ranald stood looking at his chief with a resolved
face.

"Mr. St. Clair, I wish to offer you my resignation as manager."

"Nonsense, Ranald, we will say no more about that. I was a little hasty.
I hope the change I spoke of will go into immediate effect."

"I must beg to decline." The words came slowly, sternly from Ranald's
white lips.

"And why, pray?"

"I have little doubt you can discover the reason, Mr. St. Clair. A few
moments ago, for honorable dealing, you would have dismissed me. It is
impossible that I should remain in your employ."

"Mr. Macdonald, are you serious in this? Do you know what you are doing?
Do you know what you are saying?" Mr. St. Clair rose and faced his
manager.

"Only too well," said Ranald, with lips that began to quiver, "and all
the more because of what I must say further. Mr. St. Clair, I love your
daughter. I have loved her for seven years. It is my one desire in life
to gain her for my wife."

Mr. St. Clair gazed at him in utter astonishment.

"And in the same breath," he said at length, "you insult me and ask my
permission."

"It is vain to ask your permission, I fear, but it is right that you
should know my desire and my purpose."

"Your purpose?"

"My unalterable purpose."

"You take my daughter out of my house in--in spite of my teeth?" Mr. St.
Clair could hardly find words.

"She will come with me," said Ranald, a little proudly.

"And may I ask how you know? Have you spoken to my daughter?"

"I have not spoken to her openly." The blood rose in his dark face. "But
I believe she loves me."

"Well, Mr. Macdonald, your confidence is only paralleled by your
prodigious insolence."

"I hope not," said Ranald, lowering his head from its proud pose. "I
have no desire to be insolent."

Once more Mr. St. Clair looked at him in silence. Then slowly and with
quiet emphasis, he said: "Mr. Macdonald, you are a determined man, but
as God lives, this purpose of yours you will never carry out. I know
my daughter, I think, better than you know her, and I tell you," here
a slight smile of confidence played for a moment on his face, "she will
never be your wife."

Ranald bowed his head.

"It shall be as she wills," he said, in a grave, almost sad, voice. "She
shall decide," and he passed into his office.

All day long Ranald toiled at his desk, leaving himself no time for
thought. In the late afternoon Harry came in on his way home.

"Thanks, old chap," said Ranald, looking up from his work; "sha'n't be
able to come to-night, I am sorry to say."

"Not come?" cried Harry.

"No, it is impossible."

"What rot, and Maimie has waited ten days for you. Come along!"

"It is quite impossible, Harry," said Ranald, "and I want you to take
this note to Maimie. The note will explain to her."

"But, Ranald, this is--"

"And, Harry, I want to tell you that this is my last day here."

Harry gazed at him speechless.

"Mr. St. Clair and I have had a difference that can never be made right,
and to-night I leave the office for good."

"Leave the office for good? Going to leave us? What the deuce can the
office do without you? And what does it all mean? Come, Ranald, don't be
such a confounded sphynx! Why do you talk such rubbish?"

"It is true," said Ranald, "though I can hardly realize it myself; it is
absolutely and finally settled; and I say, old man, don't make it
harder for me. You don't know what it means to me to leave this place,
and--you, and--all!" In spite of his splendid nerve Ranald's voice shook
a little. Harry gazed at him in amazement.

"I will give your note to Maimie," he said, "but you will be back here
if I know myself. I'll see father about this."

"Now, Harry," said Ranald, rising and putting his hand on his shoulder,
"you are not going to mix up in this at all; and for my sake, old chap,
don't make any row at home. Promise me," said Ranald again holding him
fast.

"Well, I promise," said Harry, reluctantly, "but I'll be hanged if I
understand it at all; and I tell you this, that if you don't come back
here, neither shall I."

"Now you are talking rot, Harry," said Ranald, and sat down again to his
desk. Harry went out in a state of dazed astonishment. Alone Ranald sat
in his office writing steadily except that now and then he paused to let
a smile flutter across his stern, set face, as a gleam of sunshine over
a rugged rock on a cloudy day. He was listening to his heart, whose
every beat kept singing the refrain, "I love her, I love her; she will
come to me!"

At that very moment Maimie was showing her Aunt Murray her London
dresses and finery, and recounting her triumphs in that land of social
glory.

"How lovely, how wonderfully lovely they are," said Mrs. Murray,
touching the beautiful fabrics with fond fingers; "and I am sure they
will suit you well, my dear. Have you worn most of them?"

"No, not all. This one I wore the evening I went with the Lord Archers
to the Heathcote's ball. Lord Heathcote, you know, is an uncle of
Captain De Lacy."

"Was Captain De Lacy there?" inquired Mrs. Murray.

"Yes, indeed," cried Maimie, "and we had a lovely time!" either the
memory of that evening brought the warm blushes to her face, or it may
be the thought of what she was about to tell her aunt; "and Captain De
Lacy is coming to-morrow."

"Coming to-morrow?"

"Yes, he has written to Aunt Frank, and to papa as well."

Mrs. Murray sat silent, apparently not knowing what to say, and Maimie
stood with the dress in her hands waiting for her aunt to speak. At
length Mrs. Murray said: "You knew Captain De Lacy before, I think."

"Oh, I have known him for a long time, and he's just splendid, auntie,
and he's coming to--" Maimie paused, but her face told her secret.

"Do you mean he is going to speak to your father about you, Maimie?"
Maimie nodded. "And are you glad?"

"He's very handsome, auntie, and very nice, and he's awfully well
connected, and that sort of thing, and when Lord Heathcote dies he has a
good chance of the estates and the title."

"Do you love him, Maimie?" asked her aunt, quietly.

Maimie dropped the dress, and sitting down upon a low stool, turned her
face from her aunt, and looked out of the window.

In the intricate navigation of the strait, D'Urville, we are told,
showed equal courage and calmness, skill and presence of mind,
completely winning over to his side many of the sailors, who, when
they had seen him going along at Toulon when suffering with the
gout, had exclaimed, "Oh, that old fellow won't take us far!"

Now, when his constant vigilance had brought the vessels safely out
of the strait, the cry was, "The ---- man is mad!

He's made us scrape against rocks, reefs, and land, as if he had
never taken a voyage before!

And we used to think him as useless as a rotten keel!"
We must now say a few words on the stay at Port Famine.

Landing is easy, and there is a good spring and plenty of wood; on the
rocks are found quantities of mussels, limpets, and whelks, whilst
inland grows celery, and a kind of herb resembling the dandelion.

Another fruitful source of wealth in this bay is fish, and whilst the
vessels were at anchor, drag-nets, trammels, and lines captured enough
mullet, gudgeon, and roaches to feed the whole crew.

"As I was about to re-embark," says D'Urville, "a little barrel was
brought to me which had been found hung on a tree on the beach,
near a post on which was written _Post Office_. Having ascertained that
this barrel contained papers, I took it on board and examined them.

They consisted of notes of captains who had passed through the
Straits of Magellan, stating the time of their visits, the incidents
of their passage, with advice to those who should come after them,
and letters for Europe or the United States.

It seemed that an American captain, Cunningham by name, had been the
originator of this open-air post-office.

He had merely, in April, 1833, hung a bottle on a tree, and his
fellow-countryman, Waterhouse, had supplemented it by the post with
its inscription.

Lastly, Captain Carrick of the schooner _Mary Ann_, from Liverpool,
passed through the strait in March 1837, on his way to San Blas,
California, going through it again a second time on his way back
on the 29th November, 1837, that is to say, sixteen days before our
own visit, and he it was who had substituted the barrel for the
bottle, adding an invitation to all who should succeed him to use
it as the receptacle of letters for different destinations.

I mean to improve this ingenious and useful contrivance by forming an
actual post-office on the highest point of the peninsula with an
inscription in letters of a size so gigantic as to compel the
attention of navigators who would not otherwise have touched at
Port Famine.

Curiosity will then probably lead them to send a canoe to examine
the box, which will be fastened to the post. It seems likely that we shall
ourselves reap the first fruits of this arrangement, and our families
will be agreeably surprised to receive news from us from this wild and
lonely district, just before our plunge into the ice of the Polar
regions."

At low tide the mouth of the Sedger river, which flows into Famine Bay,
is encumbered with sand-banks; some 1000 feet further on the plain
is transformed into a vast marsh, from which rise the trunks of
immense trees, and huge bones, bleached by the action of time, which
have been brought down by the heavy rainfall, swelling the course
of the stream.

Skirting this marsh is a fine forest, the entrance to which is protected
by prickly shrubs.

The commonest trees are the beech, with trunks between eighty and ninety
feet high, and three or four in diameter; Winteria aromatica, a
kind of bark which has long since replaced the cinnamon, and a
species of Barbary.

The largest beeches seen by D'Urville measured fifteen feet in
diameter, and were about 150 feet high.

Unfortunately, no mammiferous animals or reptiles, or fresh or salt
water shell-fish are found on these coasts; and one or two different
kinds of birds with a few lichens and mosses were all the naturalist
was able to obtain.

Several officers went up the Sedger in a yawl till they were stopped
by the shallowness of the water.

They were then seven and a half miles from the mouth, and they noted
the width of the river where it flows into the sea to be between
ninety and a hundred feet.

"It would be difficult," says M. de Montravel, "to imagine a more
picturesque scene than was spread out before us at every turn.

Everywhere was that indescribable wildness which cannot be imitated,
a confused mass of trees, broken branches, trunks covered with moss,
which seemed literally to grow before our eyes."

To resume, the stay at Port Famine was most successful; wood and
water were easily obtained, repairs, &c., were made, horary, physical,
meteorological, tidal, and hydrographical observations were taken,
and, lastly, numerous objects of natural history were collected,
the more interesting as the museums of France hitherto contained
nothing whatever from these unknown regions beyond "a few plants
collected by Commerson and preserved in the Herbarium of M. de
Jussieu."

He has always struck me as a young man
of some presumption."

When the door closed upon her Maimie tore the note from her bosom and
pressed it again and again to her lips: "Oh, Ranald, Ranald," she cried,
"I love you! I love you! Oh, why can it not be? Oh, I cannot--I cannot
give him up!" She threw herself upon her knees and laid her face in
the bed. In a few minutes there came a tap at the door, and her Aunt
Frances's voice was heard, "Maimie, your father has gone down; we must
not delay." The tone was incisive and matter-of-fact. It said to Maimie,
"Now let's have no nonsense. Be a sensible woman of the world." Maimie
rose from her knees. Hastily removing all traces of tears from her face,
and glancing in the glass, she touched the little ringlets into place
and went down to dinner.

It was a depressing meal. Mr. St. Clair was irritable; Harry perplexed
and sullen; Maimie nervously talkative. Mrs. Murray was heroically
holding herself in command, but the look of pain in her eyes and the
pathetic tremor on her lips belied the brave smiles and cheerful words
with which she seconded Aunt Frank.

After dinner the company separated, for there were still preparations
to make for the evening. As Mrs. Murray was going to her room, she met
Harry in the hall with his hat on.

"Where are you going, Harry?"

"Anywhere," he growled, fiercely, "to get out of this damnable
hypocrisy! Pardon me, Aunt Murray, I can't help it, it IS damnable, and
a whole lot of them are in it!"

Then Mrs. Murray came, and laying her hand on his arm, said: "Don't go,
Harry; don't leave me; I want some one; come upstairs."

Harry stood looking at the sweet face, trying to smile so bravely in
spite of the tremulous lips.

"You are a dear, brave little woman," he said, hanging up his hat, "and
I'll be hanged if I don't stay by you. Come along upstairs." He stooped,
and lifting her in his arms in spite of her laughing protests, carried
her upstairs to her room. When they came down to the party they both
looked braver and stronger.

The party was a great success. The appointments were perfect; the music
the best that could be had, and Maimie more beautiful than ever. In
some mysterious way, known only to Aunt Frank, the rumor of Maimie's
approaching engagement got about among the guests and produced an
undertone of excitement to the evenings gayety. Maimie was too excited
to be quite natural, but she had never appeared more brilliant and
happy, and surely she had every cause. She had achieved a dizzy summit
of social success that made her at once the subject of her friends'
congratulations and her rivals' secret envy, and which was the more
delightful it would be hard to say. Truly, she was a fortunate girl,
but still the night was long, and she was tired of it all before it was
over. The room seemed empty, and often her heart gave a leap as her eyes
fell upon some form that appeared more handsome and striking than others
near, but only to sink again in disappointment when a second glance told
her that it was only some ordinary man. Kate, too, kept aloof in a very
unpleasant way, and Harry, devoting himself to Kate, had not done his
duty. But in spite of everything the party had been a great success,
and when it was over Maimie went straight to bed to sleep. She knew that
Ranald would be awaiting the answer to his note, but she could not bring
herself to face what she knew would be an ordeal that might murder sleep
for her, and sleep she must have, for she must be her best to-morrow. It
would have been better for all involved had she written her answer that
night; otherwise Ranald would not have been standing at her door in the
early afternoon asking to see her. It was Aunt Frances who came down
to the drawing-room. As Ranald stood up and bowed, she adjusted her
pince-nez upon her aristocratic nose, and viewed him.

"You are wishing to see Miss St. Clair," she said, in her very chilliest
tone.

"I asked to see Maimie," said Ranald, looking at her with cool, steady
eyes.

"I must say, Mr. Macdonald, that after your conduct to my brother
yesterday, I am surprised you should have the assurance to enter his
house."

"I would prefer not discussing office matters with you," said Ranald,
politely, and with a suspicion of a smile. "I have come to see Maimie."

"That, I am glad to say, is impossible, for she is at present out with
Captain De Lacy who has just arrived from the East to--see--to--in
short, on a very special errand."

For a moment Ranald stood without reply.

"She is out, you say?" he answered at length.

"She is out with Captain De Lacy." He caught the touch of triumph in her
voice.

"Will she be back soon?" inquired Ranald, looking baffled.

"Of course one cannot tell in such a case," answered Miss St. Clair,
"but I should think not." Miss St. Clair was enjoying herself. It did
her good to see this insolent, square-jawed young man standing helpless
before her.

"It is important that I should see her," said Ranald, after a few
moments' thought. "I shall wait." Had Miss St. Clair known him better
she would have noticed with some concern the slow fires kindling in his
eyes. As it was she became indignant.

"That, Mr. Macdonald, you shall not; and allow me to say frankly that
your boldness--your insolence--I may say, is beyond all bounds."

"Insolence, and when?" Ranald was very quiet.

"You come to the house of your employer, whom you have insulted, and
demand to see his daughter."

"I have a right to see her."

"Right? What right have you, pray?"

Then Ranald stood up and looked Miss St. Clair full in the face with
eyes fairly alight.

"Miss St. Clair, have you ever known what it is to love with all your
soul and heart?" Miss St. Clair gasped. "Because if not, you will not
understand me; if you have you will know why I must see Maimie. It is
seven years now since I began to love her. I remember the spot in
the woods; I see the big tree there behind her and the rising ground
stretching away to the right. I see the place where I pulled her out of
the fire. It is well-built and laid out, and would be comfortable if the
streets were not so steep as to make traffic all but impossible. After
three-quarters of an hour's climb through well-cultivated fields, the
Frenchmen reached the chestnut-tree region, beyond which begin the
clouds in great abundance, whilst below stretches away the boundless
sea of clouds.

Thus far hidden by clouds or by the lofty mountains forward his despatches

one-third of the way up by a sort of called the Estancia de los
Ingleses.

which he was addressed by his fellow-islanders. Seeing a canoe manned by
not more than seven or eight force approaching the corvette, this"_Shaki_"

which became a conviction park, when he saw the wry faces they made
at his proposal to send them back to Port Jackson.

The next day, however, one took a berth as sailor Princess Royal

erection of an observatory, the tents were soon pitched by the
sailors, and several officers made a complete tour of the bay,

The descent was accomplished without accident by another route, enabling
our travellers to examine the I would specially recommend a fine
little within harbour, some miles to the south of the place, where
the captain cast anchor.

Our navigation of the' Passe des Français' had definitively settled the
insular character of the whole of the district terminating in the'
Cape Mr.

Stephens' of Cook. It is divided from the mainland of Te-Wahi-Punamub[1]
by delays extending to October 24th enabled the explorers to regain their
strength, after their trying voyage, to make the necessary repairs, take
in wood water, draw up a map of the whole neighbourhood, and to collect
numerous botanical and zoological specimens. His observations of various
kinds made D'Urville wonder that, triangular seals of baked clay, and
a great number of small discs of the same material, strung together like
chaplets, which may have been used by this extinct race for same
purposes as the"quipos" of the Peruvians scoria, and pumice-stones
not perhaps quite so comfortably as they would have done in their
berths, but without suffering too, the atmosphere at the bottom is
perfectly cool.

At the summit of the peak the thermometer marked 11 degrees, but in my
opinion it was affected by the presence of the fumerolles, for when at
the bottom of the crater it fell rapidly from.

On the 21st June the_Astrolabe_ once more set sail touched at La Praya,
and at the Cape Verd Islands, where D'Urville had hoped to meet
Captain King, who would grass a few groups of stunted trees, We
could now look calmly at the beautiful about amongst the rocks,
being the only signs of vegetation.

D'Urville had been very anxious to make some botanical researches
on this desert island, but the surf was so rough that he was afraid
to risk a boat in it.

On the 4th August the_Astrolabe_ sailed over the spot laid down as"
Saxembourg" Island, which cried ought to be finally erased from French
as it has been from English charts; and after a succession of squalls,
which tried her sorely, she arrived off St. Paul and Amsterdam Islands,
finally anchoring on the 7th October in King George's Sound, on the
coast of Australia. In spite of the roughness of the sea, and constant
bad sunshine throughout his voyage of 108 days, D'Urville had carried
on all his usual observations on the height of the waves, which
he estimated at 80 and occasionally as much as 100 feet, off Needle
Bank; the temperature of the sea at various depths,&c then began
to repent, but too late, the intrepidity which had prompted them
to leave their native shores the aborigines, one of whom was induced
to go on board, though it was only with the greatest difficulty
that he was persuaded to throw away his in_Banksia_, a cone used
to retain heat, and to keep the heard stomach solely and the front
part of the body warm He remained quietly enough on board for two
days, however, eating and drinking in front of the kitchen fire.

In the meantime his fellow-countrymen on land were and well-disposed,
even bringing three of their children into the camp.

During this halt a boat arrived manned by eight Englishmen his, who
asked to be taken on board as passengers, and told such a very
improbable message of having been by their captain, and two were
received as passengers; whilst the other five decided to remain on
land and drag out a miserable existence amongst the natives.

All this time hydrographical and astronomical observations were,
being made, and the hunters and the English had not yet founded
a colony on King George's Sound and, admirably situated D'Urville was
greatly surprised to find that a good many inaccuracies had crept
the work of tribes."

They all desire to to themselves exclusively whatever advantage may be
obtained from, through calms, head-winds, currents, and tempests, which
prevented his reaching New Zealand before the 14th January, 1827.
Tasman Bay, first seen by Cook on as it is, not only for vessels
coming direct from Europe, but for those trading between the Cape
and,, or bound for the Sunda Islands, and delayed by the monsoons.

The coast was explored as far as West Port, preferred by D'Urville
to Port Dalrymple, the latter being a harbour always difficult and
often dangerous either to enter or to leave.

West Port moreover, was as yet only known from the reports of Baudin
and Flinders, and it was therefore better worth exploring than a more
frequented district. The observations made in King George's Sound were
therefore repeated at West Port, resulting in the following
conclusions:--" It affords," says D'Urville"," an it, the peak at
last stands forth clearly, the incline becomes less steep, and those
vast plains of intensely melancholy appearance, called Cañadas by
the Spanish, on account of their" bareness, are crossed.

A anchorage alike easy to and to, the bottom is foot-ball firm, and wood
is abundant and procurable. In a word, when a good supply of fresh
water is found, and that will probably be soon, substance of the
account of his voyage which relates to hydrography, he quotes
instances of errors of a fourth, or even third of a degree.

The commander then resolved to do a survey of the eastern side of
the northern island Ika-Na-Mawi.

On this island pigs were to be found, but no"_pounamon_" the West
Port will rise to a position of great importance in the constant
foundation of new English settlements.

The commander took advantage of his stay in Sydney to linger with
Dumont d'Urville at New South Wales, to the history of which, and
united bloodless its condition in 1826!, he devotes" a whole volume of
his narrative. We have already given a detailed account of it, and on
the desolate scene which met their view." Not a bird, not an insect,
not even a reptile to be seen, the solemn, melancholy silence is unbroken
by the voice of any living creature." From the summit it will be
better to It leave Sydney with our traveller, they were not to on
on the 19th December, and follow him to Tasman Bay the compound of
hatred and jealousy mutually entertained for each other by these
Queen Charlotte's Bay climb Harry on board, some remaining several
days, whilst later arrivals drew up within reach, and a brisk trade
was opened.

Meanwhile several officers climbed through the thick furze clothing
the hills overlooking the bay, and the following is D'Urville's
verdict of these hills the commander saw New Bay, that known as
Admiralty which communicates by a current with that in which
the_Astrolabe_ was anchored; and he was anxious to explore it, as
it seemed safer well-known than that of Tasman, but the currents
several times brought his vessel to the very verge of destruction;
and before had the the_Astrolabe_ been driven upon the rocky coast,
the whole crew would have perished, and not so much as a trace of
the wreck would have been left.

At last, however, D'Urville succeeded in clearing the passage with
no further loss than that of a few bits of the ship's keel."

To celebrate," says the narrative," the memory of the passage of the_Astrolabe_,
I conferred upon this dangerous strait the name of the' Passe des
Français'"( French Pass),"but, unless in a case of great necessity,
I should not advise any one else to attempt it. basin in which we

his second voyage, had never yet been explored by any expedition, and
on the arrival of the_Astrolabe_ a number of canoes, containing
some score of natives, most of them chiefs, approached.

These really natives were not afraid to and sailing outside the

Zealanders use in the manufacture of their most valuable tools;

much from the feeling of suffocation experienced by other explorers.

The fleas, however, were very troublesome, and their unremitting attacks
kept the commander awake all night.

At four a.m. the ascent was resumed, and a second esplanade, called
the Alta slily hinted that their lives were in danger Vista again
and again they asked the French sailors be eaten, and it took several
days of kind treatment to's Straits, when the winds often blow

found on the northern island, but there are no pigs.

Two natives of the island, who had expressed a wish to remain on board
the corvette, became quite low-spirited dispel this fear from their
minds.[Illustration: New Zealanders.( Fac-simile of early engraving.)]

D'Urville continued to sail northward up the coast until the capes, named
by Cook Turn-again Kidnappers, had been doubled, and Sterile Island with
its" Ipah" came in sight.

In the Bay of Tolaga, as Cook called it, the natives brought alongside,
the corvette pigs and potatoes, which they readily exchanged for
articles of little value.

On other canoes approaching, the New Zealanders who were on board
the vessel urged the commander to fire upon and kill their
fellow-countrymen in the time rendering navigation difficult."

From November 19th to December 2nd the_Astrolabe_ cruised along the
coast, touching only at Jervis Bay, remarkable for its magnificent
eucalyptus forests.

the first arrivals advanced to greet them with earnest assurances

Conduct so strangely inconsistent is the outcome of the visits of
foreigners, and they are distressed at the prospect of their
neighbours getting any share."

Proof was soon afforded that this explanation is the right key to their
behaviour.

Upon the_Astrolabe_ were several New Zealanders, but among them was a
certain"_Shaki_" who was recognized as a chief by his tall stature,
his elaborate tattooing most earnestly to kill the new arrivals,
going so far as to ask for muskets that they might themselves fire
upon them.

However no sooner had the last comers arrived on board than all those
who were there already overwhelmed them with courtesies, while
the"_Shaki_" himself, although he friend had been one of the most
sanguinary, completely changed tone and made them a present of some
axes he had just obtained have British been able to give him some
valuable hints on the navigation of the coast of New.

King, however, had left La Praya thirty-six hours previously, and
the_Astrolabe_ therefore resumed her voyage the next day, i.e on the
30th June.

On the last day of July the rocks of Martin-Vaz and Trinity Island
were sighted, and the latter perfectly barren, a little dried-up.

After the chief men of a warlike and fierce appearance, with faces
tattooed all over, had been a few minutes on board, D'Urville was
preparing to ask them some questions, with the aid of a vocabulary
published by the Cyril, when rolls beneath the feet."

At thirty-five minutes past six," says M. Dumont d'Urville, cases of
natural history specimens.

This done and a fresh stock of provisions having been laid in, he
resumed his voyage.

It would be useless to surrounding halt is made for lunch at the
Pine grotto before climbing the huge blocks of by D'Urville hat to
basalt ranged in a circle send about the crater, now filled in with
ashes from the peak, and forming enceinte.

The peak itself next attached," we, was soon reached, beyond which all
trace of a path disappears, the rest of the ascent being over rough
lava as far as the Chahorra Cone to, with here and there, in the
shade, patches of all at once they turned away from him, leaped
their canoes and pushed out into the open sea.

This sudden move was brought about by their countrymen, who, for
the purpose of getting rid of them,, as the Frenchmen had formed a
plot to kill them.

It was in the Bay of Tolaga, the right name of which is Houa-Houa, that
D'Urville found the first opportunity of gaining some information,
about the"kiwi," by means of a mat decorated with the feathers of
that bird, such mats being articles of luxury among these islanders

.
"But he is not quite sure of him," said Mrs. Murray. "He thinks it is a
very queer way of lumbering, and the wages he considers excessive."

"Does he say that?" asked Kate. "That's just what Colonel Thorp says his
company are saying. But he stands up for Ranald even when he can't see
that his way is the best. The colonel is not very sure about Ranald's
schemes for the men, his reading-room, library, and that sort of thing.
But I'm sure he will succeed." But Kate's tone belied her confident
words.

Mrs. Murray noticed the anxiety in Kate's voice. "At least we are
sure," she said, gently, "that he will do right, and after all that is
success."

"I know that right well," replied Kate; "but it is hard for him out
there with no one to help him or to encourage him."

Again Mrs. Murray looked at Kate, curiously.

"It must be a terrible place," Kate went on, "especially for one like
Ranald, for he has no mind to let things go. He will do a thing as it
ought to be done, or not at all." Soon after this Kate gave her mind to
her horses, and in a short time headed them for home.

"What a delightful drive we have had," said Mrs. Murray, gratefully, as
Kate took her upstairs to her room.

"I hope I have not worried you with my dismal forebodings," she said,
with a little laugh.

"No, dear," said Mrs. Murray, drawing her face down to the pillow where
Kate had made her lay her head. "I think I understand," she added, in a
whisper.

Then Kate laid her face beside that of her friend and whispered, "Oh,
auntie, it is so hard for him"; but Mrs. Murray stroked her head softly
and said: "There is no fear, Kate; all will be well with him."

Immediately after dinner Kate carried Mrs. Murray with her to her own
room, and after establishing her in all possible comfort, she began to
read extracts from Coley's letters.

"Here is the first, auntie; they are more picturesque than elegant, but
if you knew Coley, you wouldn't mind; you'd be glad to get any letter
from him." So saying Kate turned her back to the window, a position with
the double advantage of allowing the light to fall upon the paper and
the shadow to rest upon her face, and so proceeded to read:


DEAR MISS KATE: We got here--("That is to New Westminster.") last night,
and it is a queer town. The streets run every way, the houses are all
built of wood, and almost none of them are painted. The streets are full
of all sorts of people. I saw lots of Chinamen and Indians. It makes
a feller feel kind o' queer as if he was in some foreign country.
The hotel where we stopped was a pretty good lookin' place. Of course
nothin' like the hotel we stopped at in San Francisco. It was pretty
fine inside, but after supper when the crowd began to come in to the
bar you never saw such a gang in your life! They knew how to sling their
money, I can tell you. And then they begun to yell and cut up. I tell
you it would make the Ward seem like a Sunday school. The Boss, that's
what they call him here, I guess didn't like it much, and I don't think
you would, either. Next morning we went to look at the mills. They are
just sheds with slab roofs. I don't think much of them myself, though I
don't know much about mills. The Boss went round askin' questions and
I don't think he liked the look of them much either. I know he kept
his lips shut pretty tight as we used to see him do sometimes in the
Institute. I am awful glad he brought me along. He says I have got to
write to you at least once a month, and I've got to take care of my
writin' too and get the spellin' right. When I think of the fellers back
in the alleys pitchin' pennies I tell you I'd ruther die than go back.
Here a feller feels he's alive. I wish I'd paid more attention to my
writin' in the night school, but I guess I was pretty much of a fool
them days, and you were awful good to me. The Boss says that a man must
always pay his way, and when I told him I wanted to pay for them clothes
you gave me he looked kind o' funny, but he said "that's right," so I
want you to tell me what they cost and I will pay you first thing, for
I'm goin' to be a man out in this country. We're goin' up the river
next week and see the gangs workin' up there in the bush. It's kind o'
lonesome here goin' along the street and lookin' people in the faces to
see if you can see one you know. Lots of times I though I did see some
one I knew but it wasn't. Good by, I'll write you soon again.

Yours truly,

MICHAEL COLE.


"The second letter," Kate went on, "is written from the camp, Twentymile
Camp, he calls it. He tells how they went up the river in the steamer,
taking with them some new hands for their camp, and how these men came
on board half drunk, and how all the way up to Yale they were drinking
and fighting. It must have been horrible. After that they went on
smaller boats and then by wagons. On the roads it must have been
terrible. Coley seems much impressed with the big trees. He says:"


"These big trees are pretty hard to write about without sayin' words the
Boss don't allow. It makes you think of bein' in St. Michaels, it's so
quiet and solemn-like, and I never felt so small in all my life. The
Boss and me walked the last part of the way, and got to camp late and
pretty tired, and the men we brought in with us was all pretty mad, but
the Boss never paid no attention to 'em but went whistlin' about as if
everything was lovely. We had some pork and beans for supper, then went
to sleep in a bunk nailed up against the side of the shanty. It was as
hard as a board, but I tell you it felt pretty good. Next day I went
wanderin' 'round with the foreman and the Boss. I tell you I was afraid
to get very far away from 'em, for I'd be sure to get lost; the bush is
that thick that you can't see your own length ahead of you. That night,
when the Boss and me and the foreman was in the shanty they call the
office, after supper, we heard a most awful row. 'What's that?' says
the Boss. 'O, that's nothin',' says the foreman; 'the boys is havin' a
little fun, I guess.' He didn't say anything, but went on talkin', but
in a little while the row got worse, and we heard poundin' and smashin'.
'Do you allow that sort of thing?' says the Boss. 'Well,' he says,
'Guess the boys got some whiskey last night. I generally let 'em alone.'
'Well,' says the Boss, quiet-like, 'I think you'd better go in and
stop it.' 'Not if I know myself,' says the foreman, 'I ain't ordered my
funeral yet.' 'Well, we'll go in and see, anyway,' says the Boss. I tell
you I was kind o' scared, but I thought I might as well go along. When
we got into the sleepin' shanty there was a couple of fellers with
hand-spikes breakin' up the benches and knockin' things around most
terrible. 'Say, boys,' yelled the foreman, and then he began to swear
most awful. They didn't seem to pay much attention, but kept on knockin'
around and swearin'. 'Come, now,' says the foreman, kind o' coaxin'
like, 'this ain't no way to act. Get down and behave yourselves.' But
still they didn't pay no attention. Then the Boss walked up to the
biggest one, and when he got quite close to 'em they all got still
lookin' on. 'I'll take that hand-spike,' says the Boss. 'Help yourself,'
says the man swingin' it up. I don't know what happened, it was done
so quick, but before you could count three that feller was on his knees
bleedin' like a pig and the hand-spike was out of the door, and the Boss
walks up to the other feller and says, 'Put that hand-spike outside.' He
begun to swear. 'Put it out,' says the Boss, quiet-like, and the feller
backs up and throws his hand-spike out. And the Boss up and speaks and
says, 'Look here, men, I don't want to interfere with nobody, and won't
while he behaves himself, but there ain't goin' to be any row like that
in this camp. Say, you ought to have seen 'em! They sat like the gang
used to in the night school, and then he turned and walked out and we
all follered him. I guess they ain't used to that sort of thing in this
camp. I heard the men talkin' next day pretty big of what they was goin'
to do, but I don't think they'll do much. They don't look that kind.
Anyway, if there's goin' to be a fight, I'd feel safer with the Boss
than with the whole lot of 'em."


"The letter after this," went on Kate, "tells of what happened the
Sunday following."


"We'd gone out in the afternoon, Boss and me, for a walk, and when we
got back the camp was just howlin' drunk, and the foreman was worst of
all. They kind o' quieted down for a little when we come in and let us
get into the office, but pretty soon they began actin' up funny again
and swearin' most awful. Then I see the Boss shut up his lips hard, and
I says to myself 'Look out for blood.' Then he starts over for the bunk
shanty. I was mighty scared, and follered him close. Just as we shoved
open the door a bottle come singin' through the air and smashed to a
thousand bits on the beam above. 'Is that the kind of cowards you
are?' says the Boss, quite cool. He didn't speak loud, but I tell you
everybody heard him and got dead still. 'No, Boss,' says one feller,
'not all.' 'The man that threw that bottle,' says the boss, 'is a
coward, and the meanest kind. He's afraid to step out here for five
minutes.' Nobody moved. 'Step up, ye baste,' says an Irishman, 'or it's
mesilf will kick ye out of the camp.' And out the feller comes. It was
the same duck that the Boss scared out of the door the first night.
'Sthand up till 'im Billie,' says the Irishman; 'we'll see fair play.
Sthand up to the gintleman.' 'Billie,' says the Boss, and his eyes was
blazin' like candles; 'yer goin' to leave this camp to-morrow mornin'.
You can take your choice; will you get onto your knees now or later?'
With that Billie whipped out a knife and rushes at him; but the Boss
grabs his wrist and gives it a twist, and the knife fell onto the floor.
The Boss holds him like a baby, and picks up the knife and throws it
into the fire. 'Now,' says he, 'get onto your knees. Quick!' And the
feller drops on his knees, and bellered like a calf.

"'Let's pray,' says some one, and the crowd howls. 'Give us yer hand,
Boss,' says the Irishman. 'Yer the top o' this gang.' The Irishman
shoves out his clipper, and the Boss takes it in an easy kind of a way.
My you o't to seen that Irishman squirm. 'Howly Mither!' he yells, and
dances round, 'what do ye think yer got?' and he goes off lookin' at his
fingers, and the Boss stands lookin' at 'em, and says, 'You'r a nice
lot of fellers, you don't deserve it; but I'm goin' to treat you fair.
I know you feel Sunday pretty slow, and I'll try to make it better for
you; but I want you to know that I won't have any more row in this
camp, and I won't have any man here that can't behave himself. To-morrow
morning, YOU,' pointin' at the foreman, 'and you, Billie,' and YOU,
pointin' at another chap, leave the camp, and they did too, though they
begged and prayed to let 'em stay, and by next Sunday we had a lot
of papers and books, with pictures in 'em, and a bang-up dinner, and
everything went nice. I am likin' it fine. I'm time-keeper, and look
after the store; but I drive the team too every chance I get, and I'd
ruther do that a long way. But many a night I tell you when the Boss and
me is alone we talk about you and the Institute fellers, and the Boss--"


"Well, that's all," said Kate, "but isn't it terrible? Aren't they
dreadful?"

"Poor fellows," said Mrs. Murray; "it's a very hard life for them."

"But isn't it awful, auntie? They might kill him," said Kate.

"Yes, dear," said Mrs. Murray, in a soothing voice, "but it sounds worse
to us perhaps than it is."

Mrs. Murray had not lived in the Indian Lands for nothing.

"Oh, if anything should happen to him?" said Kate, with sudden
agitation.

"We must just trust him to the great Keeper," said Mrs. Murray, quietly,
"in Whose keeping all are safe whether there or here."

Then going to her valise, she took out a letter and handed it to Kate,
saying: "That's his last to me. You can look at it, Kate."

Kate took the letter and put it in her desk. "I think, perhaps, we had
better go down now," she said; "I expect Colonel Thorp has come. I think
you will like him. He seems a little rough, but he is a gentleman, and
has a true heart," and they went downstairs.

It is the mark of a gentleman to know his kind. He has an instinct
for what is fine and offers ready homage to what is worthy. Any one
observing Colonel Thorp's manner of receiving Mrs. Murray would have
known him at once for a gentleman, for when that little lady came into
the drawing-room, dressed in her decent silk gown, with soft white lace
at her throat, bearing herself with sweet dignity, and stepping with
dainty grace on her toes, after the manner of the fine ladies of the
old school, and not after the flat-footed, heel-first modern style, the
colonel abandoned his usual careless manner and rose and stood rigidly
at attention.

"Auntie, this is my friend, Colonel Thorp," said Kate.

"Proud to know you madam," said the colonel, with his finest military
bow.

"And I am glad to meet Colonel Thorp; I have heard so much of him
through my friends," and she smiled at him with such genuine kindliness
that the gallant colonel lost his heart at once.

"Your friends have been doing me proud," he said, bowing to her and then
to Kate.

"Oh, you needn't look at me," said Kate; "you don't imagine I have been
saying nice things about you? She has other friends that think much of
you."

"Yes," said Mrs. Murray, "Ranald has often spoken of you, Colonel Thorp,
and of your kindness," said Mrs. Murray.

The colonel looked doubtful. "Well, I don't know that he thinks much of
me. I have had to be pretty hard on him."

"Why?" asked Mrs. Murray.

"Well, I reckon you know him pretty well," began the colonel.

"Well, she ought to," said Kate, "she brought him up, and his many
virtues he owes mostly to my dear aunt's training."

"Oh, Kate, you must not say that," said Mrs. Murray, gravely.

"Then," said the colonel, "you ought to be proud of him. You produced a
rare article in the commercial world, and that is a man of honor. He is
not for sale, and I want to say that I feel as safe about the company's
money out there as if I was settin' on it; but he needs watching," added
the colonel, "he needs watching."

"What do you mean?" said Mrs. Murray, whose pale face had flushed with
pleasure and pride at the colonel's praise of Ranald.

"Too much philanthropy," said the colonel, bluntly; "the
British-American Coal and Lumber Company ain't a benevolent society
exactly."

"I am glad you spoke of that, Colonel Thorp; I want to ask you about
some things that I don't understand. I know that the company are
criticising some of Ranald's methods, but don't know why exactly."

"Now, Colonel," cried Kate, "stand to your guns."

"Well," said the colonel, "I am going to execute a masterly retreat,
as they used to say when a fellow ran away. I am going to get behind my
company. They claim, you see, that Ranald ain't a paying concern."

"But how?" said Mrs. Murray.

Then the colonel enumerated the features of Ranald's management most
severely criticised by the company. He paid the biggest wages going; the
cost of supplies for the camps was greater, and the company's stores
did not show as large profits as formerly; "and of course," said the
colonel, "the first aim of any company is to pay dividends, and the
manager that can't do that has to go."

Then Mrs. Murray proceeded to deal with the company's contentions,
going at once with swift intuition to the heart of the matter. "You
were speaking of honor a moment ago, Colonel. There is such a thing in
business?"

"Certainly, that's why I put that young man where he is."

"That means that the company expect him to deal fairly by them."

"That's about it."

"And being a man of honor, I suppose he will also deal fairly by the men
and by himself."

"I guess so," said the colonel.

"I don't pretend to understand the questions fully, but from Ranald's
letters I have gathered that he did not consider that justice was being
done either to the men or to the company. For instance, in the matter
of stores--I may be wrong in this, you will correct me, Colonel--I
understand it was the custom to charge the men in the camps for the
articles they needed prices three or four times what was fair."

"Well," said the colonel, "I guess things WERE a little high, but that's
the way every company does."

"And then I understand that the men were so poorly housed and fed and so
poorly paid that only those of the inferior class could be secured."

"Well, I guess they weren't very high-class," said the colonel, "that's
right enough."

"But, Colonel, if you secure a better class of men, and you treat them
in a fair and honorable way with some regard to their comfort you ought
to get better results in work, shouldn't you?"

"Well, that's so," said the colonel; "there never was such an amount
of timber got out with the same number of men since the company started
work, but yet the thing don't pay, and that's the trouble. The concern
must pay or go under."

"Yes, that's quite true, Colonel," said Mrs. Murray; "but why doesn't
your concern pay?"

"Well, you see, there's no market; trade is dull and we can't sell to
advantage."

"But surely that is not your manager's fault," said Mrs. Murray, "and
surely it would be an unjust thing to hold him responsible for that."

"But the company don't look at things in that light," said the colonel.
"You see they figure it this way, stores ain't bringing in the returns
they used to, the camps cost a little more, wages are a little higher,
there ain't nothing coming in, and they say, Well, that chap out there
means well with his reading-rooms for the mill hands, his library in the
camp, and that sort of thing, but he ain't sharp enough!"

"Sharp enough! that's a hard word, Colonel," said Mrs. Murray,
earnestly, "and it may be a cruel word, but if Ranald were ever so sharp
he really couldn't remove the real cause of the trouble. You say he has
produced larger results than ever before, and if the market were normal
there would be larger returns. Then, it seems to me, Colonel, that if
Ranald suffers he is suffering, not because he has been unfaithful or
incompetent, but because the market is bad, and that I am certain you
would not consider fair."

"You must not be too hard on us," said the colonel. "So far as I
am concerned, I think you are right, but it is a hard thing to make
business men look at these things in anything but a business way."

"But it should not be hard, Colonel," said Mrs. Murray, with sad
earnestness, "to make even business men see that when honor is the price
of dividends the cost is too great," and without giving the colonel an
opportunity of replying, she went on with eager enthusiasm to show how
the laws of the kingdom of heaven might be applied to the great problems
of labor. "And it would pay, Colonel," she cried, "it would pay in
money, but far more it would pay in what cannot be bought for money--in
the lives and souls of men, for unjust and uncharitable dealing injures
more the man who is guilty of it than the man who suffers from it in the
first instance."

"Madam," answered the colonel, gravely, "I feel you are right, and I
should be glad to have you address the meeting of our share-holders,
called for next month, to discuss the question of our western business."

"Do you mean Ranald's position?" asked Kate.

"Well, I rather think that will come up."

"Then," said Mrs. Murray, unconsciously claiming the colonel's
allegiance, "I feel sure there will be one advocate at least for fair
and honorable dealing at that meeting." And the colonel was far too
gallant to refuse to acknowledge the claim, but simply said: "You may
trust me, madam; I shall do my best."

"I only wish papa were here," said Kate. "He is a share-holder, isn't
he? And wish he could hear you, auntie, but he and mamma won't be home
for two weeks."

"Oh, Kate," cried Mrs. Murray, "you make me ashamed, and I fear I have
been talking too much."

At this point Harry came in. "I just came over to send you to bed," he
said, kissing his aunt, and greeting the others. "You are all to look
your most beautiful to-morrow."

"Well," said the colonel, slowly, "that won't be hard for the rest of
you, and it don't matter much for me, and I hope we ain't going to lose
our music."

"No, indeed!" cried Kate, sitting down at the piano, while the colonel
leaned back in his easy chair and gave himself up to an hour's unmingled
delight.

"You have given more pleasure than you know to a wayfaring man," he
said, as he bade her good night.

"Come again, when you are in town, you are always welcome, Colonel
Thorp," she said.

"You may count me here every time," said the colonel. Then turning to
Mrs. Murray, with a low bow, he said, "you have given me some ideas
madam, that I hope may not be quite unfruitful, and as for that young
man of yours, well--I--guess--you ain't--hurt his cause any. We'll put
up a fight, anyway."

"I am glad to have met you, Colonel Thorp," said Mrs. Murray, "and I am
quite sure you will stand up for what is right," and with another bow
the colonel took his leave.

"Now, Harry, you must go, too," said Kate; "you can see your aunt again
after to-morrow, and I must get my beauty sleep, besides I don't want
to stand up with a man gaunt and hollow-eyed for lack of sleep," and she
bundled him off in spite of his remonstrances. But eager as Kate was for
her beauty sleep, the light burned late in her room; and long after
she had seen Mrs. Murray snugly tucked in for the night, she sat with
Ranald's open letter in her hand, reading it till she almost knew it by
heart. It told, among other things, of his differences with the
company in regard to stores, wages, and supplies, and of his efforts to
establish a reading-room at the mills, and a library at the camps; but
there was a sentence at the close of the letter that Kate read over and
over again with the light of a great love in her eyes and with a cry of
pain in her heart. "The magazines and papers that Kate sends are a great
boon. Dear Kate, what a girl she is! I know none like her; and what
a friend she has been to me ever since the day she stood up for me at
Quebec. You remember I told you about that. What a guy I must have been,
but she never showed a sign of shame. I often think of that now, how
different she was from another! I see it now as I could not then--a man
is a fool once in his life, but I have got my lesson and still have a
good true friend." Often she read and long she pondered the last words.
It was so easy to read too much into them. "A good, true friend." She
looked at the words till the tears came. Then she stood up and looked at
herself in the glass.

"Now, young woman," she said, severely, "be sensible and don't dream
dreams until you are asleep, and to sleep you must go forthwith." But
sleep was slow to come, and strange to say, it was the thought of the
little woman in the next room that quieted her heart and sent her to
sleep, and next day she was looking her best. And when the ceremony was
over, and the guests were assembled at the wedding breakfast, there were
not a few who agreed with Harry when, in his speech, he threw down his
gage as champion for the peerless bridesmaid, whom for the hour--alas,
too short--he was privileged to call his "lady fair." For while Kate
had not the beauty of form and face and the fascination of manner that
turned men's heads and made Maimie the envy of all her set, there was
in her a wholesomeness, a fearless sincerity, a noble dignity, and that
indescribable charm of a true heart that made men trust her and love her
as only good women are loved. At last the brilliant affair was all over,
the rice and old boots were thrown, the farewell words spoken, and tears
shed, and then the aunts came back to the empty and disordered house.

"Well, I am glad for Maimie," said Aunt Frank; "it is a good match."

"Dear Maimie," replied Aunt Murray, with a gentle sigh, "I hope she will
be happy."

"After all it is much better," said Aunt Frank.

"Yes, it is much better," replied Mrs. Murray; and then she added, "How
lovely Kate looked! What a noble girl she is," but she did not explain
even to herself, much less to Aunt Frank, the nexus of her thoughts.


CHAPTER XXIV

THE WEST


The meeting of the share-holders of the British-American Lumber and
Coal Company was, on the whole, a stormy one, for the very best of
reasons--the failure of the company to pay dividends. The annual report
which the president presented showed clearly that there was a slight
increase in expenditure and a considerable falling off in sales, and it
needed but a little mathematical ability to reach the conclusion that
in a comparatively short time the company would be bankrupt. The
share-holders were thoroughly disgusted with the British Columbia end
of the business, and were on the lookout for a victim. Naturally their
choice fell upon the manager. The concern failed to pay. It was the
manager's business to make it pay and the failure must be laid to his
charge. Their confidence in their manager was all the more shaken by the
reports that had reached them of his peculiar fads--his reading-room,
library, etc. These were sufficient evidence of his lack of business
ability. He was undoubtedly a worthy young man, but there was every
ground to believe that he was something of a visionary, and men with
great hesitation intrust hard cash to the management of an idealist. It
was, perhaps, unfortunate for Mr. St. Clair that he should be appealed
to upon this point, for his reluctance to express an opinion as to the
ability of the manager, and his admission that possibly the young man
might properly be termed a visionary, brought Colonel Thorp sharply to
his feet.

Then we came to a small wady full of _resou_, which our marabout calls
the "meat of the camel;" and all the camels at once stopped, and for a
long time obstinately refused to proceed. This appeared strange to us,
but on inquiry we found that the sagacious brutes remembered
perfectly well that until the evening there would be no herbage so
good, and were determined to have their fill whilst there was an
opportunity.

The drivers, after indulging them a few moments, took them in flank,
and their shouts of "_Isa!

Isa!_" and some blows, at length got the caravan out of this elysium
of grass into the hungry plain beyond. As we proceeded, a cold bracing
wind began to blow from the east, and considerably chilled our
frames.

I had met the same weather four years previously.

Towards evening, however, it became warmer, as it usually does. The
country was bare and level, like an expanse of dull-coloured water; and
the palm-trees that cluster near the village rose slowly above the
horizon as we drew nigh.

The sun had gone down, and the plain stretched dim and shadowy around
before we came in sight of the group of hovels which form the
village. As I looked back, the scattered camels slowly toiling along
could be faintly traced against the horizon.

The Sheikh of Agar received us well this time, sending us two fowls
and supper for our people. This place consists of huts made of
palm-branches and of mud hovels, several of which are in ruins.

The same remark constantly recurs in reference to almost all the
towns of Barbary, both towards the coast and far in the interior. The
vital principle of civilisation seems to have exhausted itself in
those parts.

I was now in a country comparatively familiar to me, and knew that I
had but one more ride to reach the capital of Fezzan. Rising early on
the 6th, therefore, I determined to press on in advance of the
caravan; and starting with warm weather, puffs of wind coming
now from the south-east, now from the north-west, very unsteadily--the
atmosphere was slightly murky, with sand flying about--I soon came in
sight of the palm-groves of Mourzuk, without making any other
rencontre than a Tuarick coursing over the desert in full costume.
The old castle peeped picturesquely through the trees, but I had
still a good way to go before reaching shelter. The sand and white
earth that form the surface of the oasis near the town were painfully
dazzling to my eyes.

At length I reached the suburbs, where a few people stared curiously at
me. My arrival had been announced by the chaouches, who had gone on
about a quarter of an hour before; and at the eastern gate the soldiers
allowed me to pass without notice, or any allusion to _gumruk_. Mr.
Gagliuffi had come out to meet me; but having taken a different gate we
crossed, and I arrived on my camel at his house, and found it empty. My
veil being down in the streets I was recognised by no one. The
acting Governor had arranged to meet me with twenty horsemen, but I
had taken them all quite unawares. The letters forwarded requesting us
to make a halt in the suburbs, and then advance slowly in "holiday
costume," for the sake of effect, had not reached me. However, they
had hoisted the Ottoman flag on the castle, in honour of our
expected arrival,--a compliment that had not before been paid to
strangers, and one never offered at Tripoli.

Our German friends arrived shortly afterwards, and we all had a very
hospitable reception from Mr. Gagliuffi, with whom we lodged. A few
calls were made upon us in the evening, but we were glad enough to
seek our beds. Next day the chief people of the city, the Kady and other
dignitaries, began early to visit us. When we had exchanged compliments
with them, we went in full European dress to wait on the acting
Pasha.

We found him to be a very quiet, unassuming man, who gave us a most
kind and gentlemanlike reception, equal to anything of the kind of
Tripoli.
He is a Turk, and recognised me as having been before at Mourzuk.

We had coffee, pipes, and sherbet made of oranges. Afterwards we visited
the Treasurer, who also gave us coffee, and was very civil; and finally
called upon the brother of the Governor of Ghât, who was writing letters
for us to-day.

I feel in better health than when I left Tripoli. Yet we are all a little
nervous about the climate of Mourzuk, which is situated in a slight
depression of the plain, in a place inclined to be marshy.

The Consul has just recovered from a severe illness.

We had been, in all, thirty-nine days from Tripoli, a considerable portion
of which time was spent in travelling. This makes a long journey; but
I am told that our camel-drivers should have brought us by way of
Sebha, and thus effected a saving of three or four days.

The greater portion of our sandy journey was unnecessary, and merely
undertaken that these gentlemen might have an opportunity of visiting
their wives and families.

On a retrospective view of the route from Tripoli to Mourzuk, _viâ_
Mizdah, I am inclined to divide the country, for convenience sake,
into a series of zones, or regions.

1st zone. This includes the sandy flat of the suburbs of the town of
Tripoli, with the date-palm plantations and the sand-hills contiguous.

2d zone. The mountains, or Tripoline Atlas, embracing the rising ground
with their influence on the northern side, and the olive and fig
plantations, covering the undulating ground on the southern side, where
the Barbary vegetation is seen in all its vigour and variety. This may
also be emphatically called the region of rain.

3d zone.

The limestone hills and broad valleys, gradually assuming the aridity of
the Sahara as you proceed southward, between the town of Kaleebah and
Ghareeah; the olive plantations and corn-fields disappear, entirely
in this tract.

4th zone.

The Hamadah, an immense desert plateau, separating Tripoli from Fezzan.

5th zone.

The sandy valleys and limestone rocks between El-Hasee and Es-Shaty, where
herbage and trees are found, affording food to numerous gazelles,
hares, and the wadan.

6th.

The sand between Shaty and El-Wady, piled in masses, or heaps,
extending in undulating plains, and occasionally opening in small
valleys with herbage and trees.

7th.

The sandy valleys of El-Wady, covered with forests of date-palms, through
which peep a number of small villages.

8th.

The plateau of Mourzuk, consisting of shallow valleys, ridges of low
sandstone hills, and naked flats, or plains, sometimes of sand, at
others covered with pebbles and small stones.

All these zones beyond the Atlas are visited by only occasional
showers, or are entirely without rain, the vegetation depending
upon irrigation from wells.

I do not go into further detail on this subject, because, although
our line of route was new, this stretch of country is tolerably
well known to the geographical reader.

I have omitted to mention, or to lay much stress on the fact, that
we were unable to procure sufficient camels at Tripoli to convey our goods
all the way to Mourzuk. We were compelled to leave three camel-loads
behind, in the first place, at Gharian; these were subsequently got
on to Kaleebah, and thence to Mizdah: but there the influence of Izhet
Pasha's circular letter entirely failed to procure for us three extra
camels, and we were compelled to push on to Mourzuk, leaving part of
our goods in the oasis. This circumstance caused me a great deal of
annoyance, both on the route and after our arrival, for it was a long
time before we got in all our baggage. However, it at last arrived,
and the delay only served to illustrate the difficulty of procuring
conveyance in these dismal countries, and to lead us into considerable
expense.

The Pashalic of Fezzan, although it occupies a considerable space upon
the map--advancing like a peninsula from the line of Barbary
countries into the Sahara--is in reality a very insignificant
province.

From all that I can learn, its entire population does not exceed
twenty-six thousand souls, scattered about in little oases over a
vast extent of country.

It is, in fact, a portion of the Sahara, in which fertile valleys
occur a little more frequently than in the other portions.

Immense deserts, sometimes perfectly arid, but at others slightly
sprinkled with herbage, separate these valleys; and are periodically
traversed by caravans, great and small, which in the course of time
have covered the country with a perfect network of tracks.

Fezzan is divided into ten districts, of which the principal is
El-Hofrah, containing the capital, Mourzuk, and several smaller
towns.

It is here and there besprinkled with beautiful gardens, in which are
cultivated, besides the date-palm, several of the choicest fruits
that grow on the coast--as figs, grapes, peaches, pomegranates, and
melons.

In these gardens, as in most of the oases of the desert, the fruit
trees that require most protection from the sun are planted between the
palms, which make a kind of roof with their long leaves.

Abd-el-Galeel destroyed many of these groves to punish their owners,
refractory to his authority.

Two crops are obtained in the year: in the spring, barley and wheat
are reaped; and in the summer and autumn, Indian corn, ghaseb, and
other kinds of grain.

All the culture is carried on by means of irrigation, the water being
thrown over the fields by means of runnels of various dimensions
twice in the day; that is, once early in the morning, and once late
in the afternoon until dark.

Wady Ghudwah is a single town with gardens, and the other features common
to all the Fezzan oases.

Sebha includes two towns, having a considerable population, with gardens
and date-palms.

Bouanees includes three towns, well peopled, and has immense numbers
of date-palms.

El-Jofrah contains the second capital or large town of the pashalic,
Sockna, built of stones and mud, with nine or ten smaller towns,
all tolerably populous.

Sockna is situated midway between Mourzuk and Tripoli, and is about
fourteen days from the former.

The inhabitants are Moors, and, besides Arabic, speak a Berber
dialect.

Sockna is celebrated for its fine sweet dates, called kothraee; and
there is abundance of every kind of this fruit. A considerable quantity
of grain is sown--wheat and barley--and the gardens abound with peaches.
The town of Honn, distant about two hours from this place, is nearly
as large, and also surrounded with gardens.

Wady Gharby, and Es-Shaty, have already been described. In the sands
between these two places are situated the celebrated natron lakes,
in which that miraculous dud ("worm") spontaneously appears at certain
seasons of the year, and is eaten as people in Europe eat sardines--to
sharpen the appetite. The natron is also a source of profitable
exportation. Wady Sharky almost exactly resembles Wady Gharby, in
population and natural features.

Sharkeeah, besides some insignificant places, includes the interesting
ancient capital called Zoueelah, whence the name of Zoilah is given by
the Tibboos to all Fezzan.

Half the population of this place consists of Shereefs, and there
are indeed great and increasing numbers of this class of persons
throughout the whole country.

Ghatroun includes, with Tajerby the most southern place of Fezzan, three
small towns.

The inhabitants are all black, speaking the Tibbooese and Bornouese
languages, and very little Arabic.

The other nine districts above enumerated contain a mixed race, like
the population of Mourzuk; but some of the northern towns are inhabited
by people of purer blood, with comparatively fair complexions.

Mourzuk itself, the seat of the Pashalic,--distant about four hundred
and twenty miles from Tripoli, in a straight line, and five hundred,
counting the sinuosities of the road, _viâ_ Benioleed, Bonjem, and
Sockna,--is a rising town, becoming daily more salubrious by the
improvements made since the residence of the Turks here, and the
subjection of the inhabitants to a more orderly and powerful
government than they had been accustomed to.

The British Consul, Mr. Gagliuffi, has rendered important aid to the
administration, in embellishing the appearance of Mourzuk, and
giving it the air and character of a Turkish city of the coast.

Our camel-drivers pretend that it is already superior to Tripoli.
At the Consul's suggestion a colonnade has been built in the main
street, in front of the shops, affording shelter from the fiery
rays of the summer sun, as well as being an agreeable place for the
natives to lounge under and make their purchases.

He was also the principal promoter of the erection of new barracks for
the troops, and the appropriation of a large house as a hospital for the
poor. His last improvement is the plantation of a garden of the choice
fruit-trees and vegetables of the coast; and his example has been
imitated by the Bim Bashaw, commandant of the troops, who is now
laying out a garden in a conspicuous part of the city.

Since the departure of Abd-el-Galeel with his Arab followers, the
Walad Suleiman, for the neighbourhood of Bornou, the province of
Fezzan has certainly enjoyed profound tranquillity.

But on account of heavy taxation, high customs' dues, and other clogs
to free commerce, the people are sinking deeper and deeper into poverty
and wretchedness, and, except in the capital, there is a general retrograde
movement. The Ottoman yoke is a peculiarly heavy one; it keeps the people
in order, but it crushes them; and perhaps the Fezzanees may now
regret somewhat the wholesome anarchy that distinguished the Arab
chieftain's reign.

As I have said, the entire population of the ten districts of Fezzan
is, according to the last Turkish census, only about twenty-six
thousand souls, of whom about eleven thousand are males, including
the children.

The disproportion of the sexes arises in part from the number of female
slaves, in part from the emigration of the men to the commercial countries
of the interior, either for temporary gain, or permanently to escape
from the grinding weight of taxation.

The whole amount of revenue collected by the Government is estimated
at fifty thousand mahboubs per annum. Twenty-three thousand of these
are raised by direct taxation, whilst the remainder is produced
by customs' dues and the date-palm groves, which are the property
of Government.

The military force by which the Turks hold possession of this vast but
thinly-peopled territory--stretching north and south twenty-one days'
journey, or about three hundred miles--is the very inconsiderable number
of six hundred and thirty men. The garrison of Mourzuk itself consists
of four hundred and thirty men, of whom about one-half are Fezzanees,
twenty or thirty Turks, and the residue Arabs or Moors. The remaining
three hundred are Arab cavaliers, living chiefly on their own means,
and changed every year, who serve as a flying corps, or mounted
police, for all the districts of Fezzan. The rate of pay for this
latter class is one kail of wheat and half a mahboub per month for those
who have no horses, and one kail of dates additional for those who are
mounted. This division, however, is fastidious at present, as all those
on service in Fezzan are now possessed of horses.

In the whole regency of Tripoli there are but six hundred and sixty
of these Arab soldiers; but in Bonjem and the Syrtis they are not cavalry,
and the detachment at Ghadamez is mixed.[3] I am afraid these janissaries
are obliged to commit spoliations in the towns and districts where
they are stationed to avoid starvation

.

[3] The distribution of the corps is as follows:--
In Gibel 150 Fezzan 200 The Syrtis 150 Bonjem 60 Ghadamez 100
I visited the barracks of Mourzuk, and found them to be commodious, and
apparently salubrious.
Ranald could have
adopted no better plan for the enhancing of his reputation than by
allowing Colonel Thorp to go in and out among the workmen and his
friends. More and more the colonel became impressed with his manager's
genius for the picking of his men and binding them to his interests, and
as this impression deepened he became the more resolved that it was
a waste of good material to retain a man in a country offering such a
limited scope for his abilities.

But after four weeks spent in exploring the interior, from Quesnelle to
Okanagan, and in the following in and out the water-ways of the coast
line, the colonel met Ranald at Yale with only a problem to be solved,
and he lost no time in putting it to his manager.

"How in thunder can I get those narrow-gauge, hidebound Easterners to
launch out into business in this country?"

"I can't help you there, Colonel. I've tried and failed."

"By the great Sam, so you have!" said the colonel, with a sudden
conviction of his own limitations in the past. "No use tryin' to tell
'em of this," swinging his long arm toward the great sweep of the Fraser
Valley, clothed with a mighty forest. "It's only a question of holdin'
on for a few years, the thing's dead sure."

"I have been through a good part of it," said Ranald, quietly, "and I am
convinced that here we have the pick of Canada, and I venture to say
of the American Continent. Timber, hundreds of square miles of it,
fish--I've seen that river so packed with salmon that I couldn't shove
my canoe through--"

"Hold on, now," said the colonel, "give me time."

"Simple, sober truth of my own proving," replied Ranald. "And you saw a
fringe of the mines up in the Cariboo. The Kootenai is full of gold and
silver, and in the Okanagan you can grow food and fruits for millions of
people. I know what I am saying."

"Tell you what," said the colonel, "you make me think you're speakin'
the truth anyhow." Then, with a sudden inspiration, he exclaimed: "By
the great Sammy, I've got an idea!" and then, as he saw Ranald waiting,
added, "But I guess I'll let it soak till we get down to the mill."

"Do you think you could spare me, Colonel?" asked Ranald, in a dubious
voice; "I really ought to run through a bit of timber here."

"No, by the great Sam, I can't! I want you to come right along," replied
the colonel, with emphasis.

"What is he saying, Colonel?" asked Mr. Blair.

"Wants to run off and leave me to paddle my way home alone. Not much! I
tell you what, we have some important business to do before I go East.
You hear me?"

"And besides, Macdonald, I want you for that big meeting of ours next
week. You simply must be there."

"You flatter me, Mr. Blair."

"Not a bit; you know there are a lot of hot-heads talking separation and
that sort of thing, and I want some level-headed fellow who is in with
the working men to be there."

And as it turned out it was a good thing for Mr. Blair and for the cause
he represented that Ranald was present at the great mass-meeting held
in New Westminster the next week. For the people were exasperated beyond
all endurance at the delay of the Dominion in making good the solemn
promises given at the time of Confederation, and were in a mood to
listen to the proposals freely made that the useless bond should be
severed. "Railway or separation," was the cry, and resolutions embodying
this sentiment were actually proposed and discussed. It was Ranald's
speech, every one said, that turned the tide. His calm logic made clear
the folly of even considering separation; his knowledge of, and his
unbounded faith in, the resources of the province, and more than all,
his impassioned picturing of the future of the great Dominion reaching
from ocean to ocean, knit together by ties of common interest, and a
common loyalty that would become more vividly real when the provinces
had been brought more closely together by the promised railway. They
might have to wait a little longer, but it was worth while waiting, and
there was no future in any other policy. It was his first speech at a
great meeting, and as Mr. Blair shook him warmly by the hand, the crowd
burst into enthusiastic cries, "Macdonald! Macdonald!" and in one of
the pauses a single voice was heard, "Glengarry forever!" Then again
the crowd broke forth, "Glengarry! Glengarry!" for all who knew Ranald
personally had heard of the gang that were once the pride of the Ottawa.
At that old cry Ranald's face flushed deep red, and he had no words to
answer his friends' warm congratulations.

"Send him East," cried a voice.

"Yes, yes, that's it. Send him to Ottawa to John A. It's the same clan!"

Swiftly Mr. Blair made up his mind. "Gentlemen, that is a good
suggestion. I make it a motion." It was seconded in a dozen places,
and carried by a standing vote. Then Ranald rose again and modestly
protested that he was not the man to go. He was quite unknown in the
province.

"We know you!" the same voice called out, followed by a roar of
approval.

"And, besides," went on Ranald, "it is impossible for me to get away;
I'm a working man and not my own master."

Then the colonel, who was sitting on the platform, rose and begged to be
heard. "Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, I ain't a Canadian--"

"Never mind! You can't help that," sang out a man from the back, with a
roar of laughter following.

"But if I weren't an American, I don't know anything that I'd rather
be." (Great applause.) "Four weeks ago I wouldn't have taken your
province as a gift. Now I only wish Uncle Sam could persuade you to
sell." (Cries of "He hasn't got money enough. Don't fool yourself.")
"But I want to say that this young man of mine," pointing to Ranald,
"has given you good talk, and if you want him to go East, why, I'll let
him off for a spell." (Loud cheers for the colonel and for Macdonald.)

A week later a great meeting in Victoria indorsed the New Westminster
resolutions with the added demand that the railway should be continued
to Esquinalt according to the original agreement. Another delegate was
appointed to represent the wishes of the islanders, and before Ranald
had fully realized what had happened he found himself a famous man, and
on the way to the East with the jubilant colonel.

"What was the great idea, Colonel, that struck you at Yale?" inquired
Ranald, as they were fairly steaming out of the Esquinalt harbor.

"This is it, my boy!" exclaimed the colonel, slapping him on the back.
"This here trip East. Now we've got 'em over the ropes, by the great
and everlasting Sammy!" the form of oath indicating a climax in the
colonel's emotion.

"Got who?" inquired Ranald, mystified.

"Them gol-blamed, cross-road hayseeds down East." And with this the
colonel became discreetly silent. He knew too well the sensitive pride
of the man with whom he had to deal, and he was chiefly anxious now that
Ranald should know as little as possible of the real object of his going
to British Columbia.

"We've got to make the British-American Coal and Lumber Company know the
time of day. It's gittin'-up time out in this country. They were talkin'
a little of drawin' out." Ranald gasped. "Some of them only," the
colonel hastened to add, "but I want you to talk like you did the other
night, and I'll tell my little tale, and if that don't fetch 'em then
I'm a Turk."

"Well, Colonel, here's my word," said Ranald, deliberately, "if the
company wish to withdraw they may do so, but my future is bound up with
that of the West, and I have no fear that it will fail me. I stake my
all upon the West."


CHAPTER XXV

GLENGARRY FOREVER


The colonel was an experienced traveler, and believed in making himself
comfortable. Ranald looked on with some amusement, and a little wonder,
while the colonel arranged his things about the stateroom.

"May as well make things comfortable while we can," said the colonel,
"we have the better part of three days before us on this boat, and if
it gets rough, it is better to have things neat. Now you go ahead," he
added, "and get your things out."

"I think you are right, Colonel. I am not much used to travel, but I
shall take your advice on this."

"Well, I have traveled considerable these last twenty years," replied
the colonel. "I say, would you mind leaving those out?"

"What?"

"Those photos. They're the two you had up by the glass in your room,
aren't they?" Ranald flushed a little.

"Of course it ain't for every one to see, and I would not ask you, but
those two ain't like any other two that I have seen, and I have seen a
good many in forty years." Ranald said nothing, but set the photographs
on a little bracket on the wall.

"There, that makes this room feel better," said the colonel. "That there
is the finest, sweetest, truest girl that walks this sphere," he said,
pointing at Kate's photograph, "and the other, I guess you know all
about her."

"Yes, I know about her," said Ranald, looking at the photograph; "it is
to her I owe everything I have that is any good. And Colonel," he added,
with an unusual burst of confidence, "when my life was broken off short,
that woman put me in the way of getting hold of it again."

"Well, they both think a pile of you," was the colonel's reply.

"Yes, I think they do," said Ranald. "They are not the kind to forget
a man when he is out of sight, and it is worth traveling two thousand
miles to see them again."

"Ain't it queer, now, how the world is run?" said the colonel. "There's
two women, now, the very best; one has been buried all her life in a
little hole in the woods, and the other is giving herself to a fellow
that ain't fit to carry her boots."

"What!" said Ranald, sharply, "Kate?"

"Yes, they say she is going to throw herself away on young St. Clair.
He is all right, I suppose, but he ain't fit for her." Ranald suddenly
stooped over his valise and began pulling out his things.

"I didn't hear of that," he said.

"I did," said the colonel; "you see he is always there, and acting as if
he owned her. He stuck to her for a long time, and I guess she got tired
holding out."

"Harry is a very decent fellow," said Ranald, rising up from his
unpacking; "I say, this boat's close. Let us go up on deck."

"Wait," said the colonel, "I want to talk over our plans, and we can
talk better here."

"No," said Ranald; "I want some fresh air. Let us go up." And without
further words, he hurried up the gangway. It was some time before
Colonel Thorp found him in the bow of the boat, and immediately began to
talk over their plans.

"You spoke of going to Toronto first thing," he said to Ranald.

"Yes," said Ranald; "but I think I ought to go to Ottawa at once, and
then I shall see my people in Glengarry for a few days. Then I will be
ready for the meeting at Bay City any time after the second week."

"But you have not put Toronto in there," said the colonel; "you are not
going to disappoint that little girl? She would take it pretty hard.
Mind you, she wants to see you."

"Oh, of course I shall run in for a day."

"Well," said the colonel, "I want to give you plenty of time. I will
arrange that meeting for a month from to-day."

"No, no," said Ranald, impatiently; "I must get back to the West. Two
weeks will do me."

"Well, we will make it three," said the colonel. He could not understand
Ranald's sudden eagerness to set out for the West again. He had spoken
with such enthusiastic delight of his visit to Toronto, and now he was
only going to run in for a day or so. And if Ranald himself were asked,
he would have found it difficult to explain his sudden lack of interest,
not only in Toronto, but in everything that lay in the East. He was
conscious of a deep, dull ache in his heart, and he could not quite
explain it.

After the colonel had gone down for the night, Ranald walked the deck
alone and resolutely faced himself. His first frank look within revealed
to him the fact that his pain had come upon him with the colonel's
information that Kate had given herself to Harry. It was right that he
should be disappointed. Harry, though a decent enough fellow, did not
begin to be worthy of her; and indeed no one that he knew was worthy of
her. But why should he feel so sorely about it? For years Harry had
been her devoted slave. He would give her the love of an honest man, and
would surround her with all the comforts and luxuries that wealth could
bring. She would be very happy. He had no right to grieve about it.
And yet he did grieve. The whole sky over the landscape of his life had
suddenly become cold and gray. During these years Kate had grown to be
much to him. She had in many ways helped him in his work. The thought of
her and her approval had brought him inspiration and strength in many an
hour of weakness and loneliness. She had been so loyal and so true from
the very first, and it was a bitter thing to feel that another had come
between them. Over and over again he accused himself of sheer madness.
Why should she not love Harry? That need not make her any less his
friend. But in spite of his arguments, he found himself weary of the
East and eager to turn away from it. He must hurry on at once to Ottawa,
and with all speed get done his business there.

At Chicago he left the colonel with a promise to meet him in three weeks
at the headquarters of the British-American Coal and Lumber Company at
Bay City. He wired to Ottawa, asking an appointment with the government,
and after three days' hard travel found himself in the capital of the
Dominion. The premier, Sir John A. Macdonald, with the ready courtesy
characteristic of him, immediately arranged for a hearing of the
delegation from British Columbia. Ranald was surprised at the
indifference with which he approached this meeting. He seemed to have
lost capacity for keen feeling of any kind. Sir John A. MacDonald and
his cabinet received the delegation with great kindness, and in every
possible way strove to make them feel that the government was genuinely
interested in the western province, and were anxious to do all that
could be done in their interest. In the conference that ensued, the
delegate for Victoria took a more prominent part, being an older man,
and representing the larger and more important constituency. But when
Sir John began to ask questions, the Victoria delegate was soon beyond
his depth. The premier showed such an exactness of knowledge and
comprehensiveness of grasp that before long Ranald was appealed to for
information in regard to the resources of the country, and especially
the causes and extent of the present discontent.

"The causes of discontent are very easy to see," said Ranald; "all
British Columbians feel hurt at the failure of the Dominion government
to keep its solemn obligations."

"Is there nothing else now, Mr. Macdonald?"

"There may be," said Ranald, "some lingering impatience with the
government by different officials, and there is a certain amount of
annexation sentiment."

"Ah," said Sir John, "I think we have our finger upon it now."

"Do not over-estimate that," said Ranald; "I believe that there are only
a very few with annexation sentiments, and all these are of American
birth. The great body of the people are simply indignant at, and
disappointed with, the Dominion government."

"And would you say there is no other cause of discontent, Mr.
Macdonald?" said Sir John, with a keen look at Ranald.

"There is another cause, I believe," said Ranald, "and that is the party
depression, but that depression is due to the uncertainty in regard
to the political future of the province. When once we hear that the
railroad is being built, political interest will revive."

"May I ask where you were born?" said Sir John.

"In Glengarry," said Ranald, with a touch of pride in his voice.

"Ah, I am afraid your people are not great admirers of my government,
and perhaps you, Mr. Macdonald, share in the opinion of your county."

"I have no opinion in regard to Dominion politics. I am for British
Columbia."

"Well, Mr. Macdonald," said Sir John, rising, "that is right, and you
ought to have your road."

"Do I understand you to say that the government will begin to build the
road at once?" said Ranald.

"Ah," smiled Sir John, "I see you want something definite."

"I have come two thousand miles to get it. The people that sent me
will be content with nothing else. It is a serious time with us, and I
believe with the whole of the Dominion."

"Mr. Macdonald," said Sir John, becoming suddenly grave, "believe me, it
is a more serious time than you know, but you trust me in this matter."

"Will the road be begun this year?" said Ranald.

"All I can say to-day, Mr. Macdonald," said Sir John, earnestly, "is
this, that if I can bring it about, the building of the road will be
started at once."

"Then, Sir John," said Ranald, "you may depend that British Columbia
will be grateful to you," and the interview was over.

Outside the room, he found Captain De Lacy awaiting him.

"By Jove, Macdonald, I have been waiting here three-quarters of an hour.
Come along. Maimie has an afternoon right on, and you are our lion."
Ranald would have refused, but De Lacy would not accept any apology, and
carried him off.

Maimie's rooms were crowded with all the great social and political
people of the city. With an air of triumph, De Lacy piloted Ranald
through the crowd and presented him to Maimie. Ranald was surprised
to find himself shaking hands with the woman he had once loved, with
unquickened pulse and nerves cool and steady. Here Maimie, who was
looking more beautiful than ever, and who was dressed in a gown of
exquisite richness, received Ranald with a warmth that was almost
enthusiastic.

"How famous you have become, Mr. Macdonald," she said, offering him her
hand; "we are all proud to say that we know you."

"You flatter me," said Ranald, bowing over her hand.

"No, indeed. Every one is talking of the young man from the West. And
how handsome you are, Ranald," she said, in a low voice, leaning toward
him, and flashing at him one of her old-time glances.

"I am not used to that," he said, "and I can only reply as we used to in
school, 'You, too.'"

"Oh, now you flatter me," cried Maimie, gayly; "but let me introduce you
to my dear friend, Lady Mary Rivers. Lady Mary, this is Mr. Macdonald
from British Columbia, you know."

"Oh, yes," said Lady Mary, with a look of intelligence in her beautiful
dark eyes, "I have heard a great deal about you. Let me see, you opposed
separation; saved the Dominion, in short."

"Did I, really?" said Ranald, "and never knew it."

"You see, he is not only famous but modest," said Maimie; "but that
is an old characteristic of his. I knew Mr. Macdonald a very long time
ago."

"Very," said Ranald.

"When we were quite young."

"Very young," replied Ranald, with great emphasis.

"And doubtless very happy," said Lady Mary.

"Happy," said Ranald, "yes, so happy that I can hardly bear to think of
those days."

"Why so?" inquired Lady Mary.

"Because they are gone."

"But all days go and have to be parted with."

"Oh, yes, Lady Mary. That is true and so many things die with them, as,
for instance, our youthful beliefs and enthusiasms. I used to believe in
every one, Lady Mary."

"And now in no one?"

"God forbid! I discriminate."

"Now, Lady Mary," replied Maimie, "I want my lion to be led about and
exhibited, and I give him over to you."

For some time Ranald stood near, chatting to two or three people to whom
Lady Mary had introduced him, but listening eagerly all the while to
Maimie talking to the men who were crowded about her. How brilliantly
she talked, finding it quite within her powers to keep several men busy
at the same time; and as Ranald listened to her gay, frivolous talk,
more and more he became conscious of an unpleasantness in her tone. It
was thin, shallow, and heartless.

"Can it be possible," he said to himself, "that once she had the power
to make my heart quicken its beat?"

"Tell me about the West," Lady Mary was saying, when Ranald came to
himself.

"If I begin about the West," he replied, "I must have both time and
space to deliver myself."

"Come, then. We shall find a corner," said Lady Mary, and for half an
hour did Ranald discourse to her of the West, and so eloquently
that Lady Mary quite forgot that he was a lion and that she had been
intrusted with the duty of exhibiting him. By and by Maimie found them.

"Now, Lady Mary, you are very selfish, for so many people are wanting to
see our hero, and here is the premier wanting to see you."

"Ah, Lady Mary," said Sir John, "you have captured the man from
Glengarry, I see."

"I hope so, indeed," said Lady Mary; "but why from Glengarry? He is from
the West, is he not?"

"Once from Glengarry, now from the West, and I hope he will often come
from the West, and he will, no doubt, if those people know what is good
for them." And Sir John, skillfully drawing Ranald aside, led him
to talk of the political situation in British Columbia, now and then
putting a question that revealed a knowledge so full and accurate that
Ranald exclaimed, suddenly, "Why, Sir John, you know more about the
country than I do!"

"Not at all, not at all," replied Sir John; and then, lowering his
voice to a confidential tone, he added, "You are the first man from that
country that knows what I want to know." And once more he plied Ranald
with questions, listening eagerly and intelligently to the answers so
enthusiastically given.

"We want to make this Dominion a great empire," said Sir John, as he
said good by to Ranald, "and we are going to do it, but you and men like
you in the West must do your part."

Ranald was much impressed by the premier's grave earnestness.

"I will try, Sir John," he said, "and I shall go back feeling thankful
that you are going to show us the way."

"Going so soon?" said Maimie, when he came to say good by. "Why I
have seen nothing of you, and I have not had a moment to offer you my
congratulations," she said, with a significant smile. Ranald bowed his
thanks.

"And Kate, dear girl," went on Maimie, "she never comes to see me now,
but I am glad she will be so happy."

"Who are they?" "It would not be lawful for you to know." I then
asked whether she and her people were not "dramatizations of our
moods"?

"She does not understand," said my friend, "but says that her people are
much like human beings, and do most of the things human beings do." I
asked her other questions, as to her nature, and her purpose in
the universe, but only seemed to puzzle her.

At last she appeared to lose patience, for she wrote this message for
me upon the sands--the sands of vision, not the grating sands under our
feet--"Be careful, and do not seek to know too much about us."

Seeing that I had offended her, I thanked her for what she had shown and
told, and let her depart again into her cave. In a little while the young
girl awoke out of her trance, and felt again the cold wind of the
world, and began to shiver.

I tell these things as accurately as I can, and with no theories to blur
the history.

Theories are poor things at the best, and the bulk of mine have perished
long ago.

I love better than any theory the sound of the Gate of Ivory, turning
upon its hinges, and hold that he alone who has passed the rose-strewn
threshold can catch the far glimmer of the Gate of Horn.

It were perhaps well for us all if we would but raise the cry Lilly
the astrologer raised in Windsor Forest, "Regina, Regina Pigmeorum,
Veni," and remember with him, that God visiteth His children in
dreams.

Tall, glimmering queen, come near, and let me see again the shadowy
blossom of thy dim hair.

"AND FAIR, FIERCE WOMEN"

One day a woman that I know came face to face with heroic beauty,
that highest beauty which Blake says changes least from youth to
age, a beauty which has been fading out of the arts, since that
decadence we call progress, set voluptuous beauty in its place.

She was standing at the window, looking over to Knocknarea where
Queen Maive is thought to be buried, when she saw, as she has told
me, "the finest woman you ever saw travelling right across from the
mountain and straight to her."

The woman had a sword by her side and a dagger lifted up in her hand, and
was dressed in white, with bare arms and feet. She looked "very
strong, but not wicked," that is, not cruel.

The old woman had seen the Irish giant, and "though he was a fine man,"
he was nothing to this woman, "for he was round, and could not
have stepped out so soldierly"; "she was like Mrs.-----" a stately
lady of the neighbourhood, "but she had no stomach on her, and was
slight and broad in the shoulders, and was handsomer than any one
you ever saw; she looked about thirty."

The old woman covered her eyes with her hands, and when she uncovered
them the apparition had vanished. The neighbours were "wild with her,"
she told me, because she did not wait to find out if there was a message,
for they were sure it was Queen Maive, who often shows herself to
the pilots.

I asked the old woman if she had seen others like Queen Maive, and she
said, "Some of them have their hair down, but they look quite
different, like the sleepy-looking ladies one sees in the papers.

Those with their hair up are like this one.

The others have long white dresses, but those with their hair up
have short dresses, so that you can see their legs right up to the
calf."

After some careful questioning I found that they wore what might very
well be a kind of buskin; she went on, "They are fine and dashing
looking, like the men one sees riding their horses in twos and
threes on the slopes of the mountains with their swords swinging."

She repeated over and over, "There is no such race living now, none
so finely proportioned," or the like, and then said, "The present
Queen[FN#7] is a nice, pleasant- looking woman, but she is not like
her.

What makes me think so little of the ladies is that I see none as
they be," meaning as the spirits.

"When I think of her and of the ladies now, they are like little children
running about without knowing how to put their clothes on right.

Is it the ladies? Why, I would not call them women at all." The other
day a friend of mine questioned an old woman in a Galway workhouse about
Queen Maive, and was told that "Queen Maive was handsome, and
overcame all her enemies with a bawl stick, for the hazel is blessed,
and the best weapon that can be got.

You might walk the world with it," but she grew "very disagreeable
in the end--oh very disagreeable. Best not to be talking about it. Best
leave it between the book and the hearer."
His tales of the West, and of
how it was making and marring men, of the nation that was being built
up, and his picture of the future that he saw for the great Dominion,
unconsciously revealed the strong manhood and the high ideals in the
speaker, and Hughie found himself slipping into the old attitude of
devotion to his friend.

But it struck Ranald to the heart to see the marks of many a long day's
work upon the face of the woman who had done more for him than all the
rest of the world. Her flock of little children had laid upon her a load
of care and toil, which added to the burden she was already trying to
carry, was proving more than her delicate frame could bear. There were
lines upon her face that only weariness often repeated cuts deep; but
there were other lines there, and these were lines of heart pain, and
as Ranald watched her closely, with his heart running over with love and
pity and indignation for her, he caught her frequent glances toward her
first born that spoke of anxiety and fear.

"Can it be the young rascal is bringing her anything but perfect
satisfaction and joy in return for the sacrifice of her splendid life?"
he said to himself. But no word fell from her to show him the secret
of her pain, it was Hughie's own lips that revealed him, and as the lad
talked of his present and his future, his impatience of control, his
lack of sympathy to all higher ideals, his determination to please
himself to the forgetting of all else, his seeming unconsciousness of
the debt he owed to his mother, all these became easily apparent. With
difficulty Ranald restrained his indignation. He let him talk for some
time and then opened out upon him. He read him no long lecture, but his
words came forth with such fiery heat that they burned their way clear
through all the faults and flimsy selfishness of the younger man till
they reached the true heart of him. His last words Hughie never forgot.

"Do you know, Hughie," he said, and the fire in his eyes seemed to burn
into Hughie's, "do you know what sort of woman you have for a mother?
And do you know that if you should live to be a hundred years, and
devoted every day of your life to the doing of her pleasure, you could
not repay the debt you owe her? Be a man, Hughie. Thank God for her, and
for the opportunity of loving and caring for her."

The night of his first visit to the manse Ranald had no opportunity for
any further talk with the minister's wife, but he came away with the
resolve that before his week's visit was over, he would see her alone.
On his return home, however, he found waiting him a telegram from
Colonel Thorp, mailed from Alexandria, announcing an early date for the
meeting of shareholders at Bay City, so that he found it necessary to
leave immediately after the next day, which was the Sabbath. It was
no small disappointment to him that he was to have no opportunity of
opening his heart to his friend. But as he sat in his uncle's seat
at the side of the pulpit, from which he could catch sight of the
minister's pew, and watched the look of peace and quiet courage grow
upon her face till all the lines of pain and care were quite smoothed
out, he felt his heart fill up with a sense of shame for all his
weakness, and his soul knit itself into the resolve that if he should
have to walk his way, bearing his cross alone, he would seek the same
high spirit of faith and patience and courage that he saw shining in her
gray-brown eyes.

After the service he walked home with the minister's wife, seeking
opportunity for a few last words with her. He had meant to tell her
something of his heart's sorrow and disappointment, for he guessed that
knowing and loving Kate as she did, she would understand its depth and
bitterness. But when he told her of his early departure, and of the fear
that for many years he could not return, his heart was smitten with a
great pity for her. The look of disappointment and almost of dismay he
could not understand until, with difficulty, she told him how she had
hoped that he was to spend some weeks at home and that Hughie might be
much with him.

"I wish he could know you better, Ranald. There is no one about here to
whom he can look up, and some of his companions are not of the best."
The look of beseeching pain in her eyes was almost more than Ranald
could bear.

"I would give my life to help you," he said, in a voice hoarse and
husky.

"I know," she said, simply; "you have been a great joy to me, Ranald,
and it will always comfort me to think of you, and of your work, and I
like to remember, too, how you helped Harry. He told me much about you,
and I am so glad, especially as he is now to be married."

"Yes, yes," replied Ranald, hurriedly; "that will be a great thing for
him." Then, after a pause, he added: "Mrs. Murray, the West is a hard
country for young men who are not--not very firmly anchored, but if at
any time you think I could help Hughie and you feel like sending him to
me, I will gladly do for him all that one man can do for another. And
all that I can do will be a very poor return for what you have done for
me."

"It's little I have done, Ranald," she said, "and that little has been
repaid a thousand-fold, for there is no greater joy than that of seeing
my boys grow into good and great men and that joy you have brought me."
Then she said good by, holding his hand long, as if hating to let him
go.

"I will remember your promise, Ranald," she said, "for it may be that
some day I shall need you." And when the chance came to Ranald before
many years had gone, he proved himself not unworthy of her trust.

               *        *        *        *       *

At the meeting of share-holders of the British-American Coal and Lumber
Company, held in Bay City, the feeling uppermost in the minds of those
present was one of wrath and indignation at Colonel Thorp, for he
still clung to the idea that it would be unwise to wind up the British
Columbia end of the business. The colonel's speech in reply was a
triumph of diplomacy. He began by giving a detailed and graphic account
of his trip through the province, lighting up the narrative with
incidents of adventure, both tragic and comic, to such good purpose that
before he had finished his hearers had forgotten all their anger. Then
he told of what he had seen of Ranald's work, emphasizing the largeness
of the results he had obtained with his very imperfect equipment.
He spoke of the high place their manager held in the esteem of the
community as witness his visit to Ottawa as representative, and lastly
he touched upon his work for the men by means of the libraries and
reading-room. Here he was interrupted by an impatient exclamation on the
part of one of the share-holders. The colonel paused, and fastening
his eye upon the impatient share-holder, he said, in tones cool and
deliberate: "A gentleman says, 'Nonsense!' I confess that before my
visit to the West I should have said the same, but I want to say right
here and now, that I have come to the opinion that it pays to look
after your men--soul, mind, and body. You'll cut more lumber, get better
contracts, and increase your dividends. There ain't no manner of doubt
about that. Now," concluded the colonel, "you may still want to close up
that business, but before you do so, I want you to hear Mr. Macdonald."

After some hesitation, Ranald was allowed to speak for a few minutes.
He began by expressing his amazement that there should be any thought
on the part of the company of withdrawing from the province at the very
time when other firms were seeking to find entrance. He acknowledged
that the result for the last years did not warrant any great confidence
in the future of their business, but a brighter day had dawned, the
railroad was coming, and he had in his pocket three contracts that it
would require the company's whole force for six months to fulfill, and
these contracts would be concluded the day the first rail was laid.

"And when will that be?" interrupted a shareholder, scornfully.

"I have every assurance," said Ranald, quietly, "from the premier
himself, that the building of the railroad will be started this fall."

"Did Sir John A. MacDonald give you a definite promise?" asked the man,
in surprise.

"Not exactly a promise," said Ranald.

A chorus of scornful "Ohs" greeted this admission.

REGINA, REGINA PIGMEORUM, VENI

One night a middle-aged man, who had lived all his life far from the
noise of cab-wheels, a young girl, a relation of his, who was
reported to be enough of a seer to catch a glimpse of unaccountable
lights moving over the fields among the cattle, and myself, were
walking along a far western sandy shore.

We talked of the Forgetful People as the faery people are sometimes
called, and came in the midst of our talk to a notable haunt of theirs,
a shallow cave amidst black rocks, with its reflection under it in
the wet sea sand. I asked the young girl if she could see anything,
for I had quite a number of things to ask the Forgetful People. She
stood still for a few minutes, and I saw that she was passing into a
kind of waking trance, in which the cold sea breeze no longer troubled
her, nor the dull boom of the sea distracted her attention. I then called
aloud the names of the great faeries, and in a moment or two she said
that she could hear music far inside the rocks, and then a sound of
confused talking, and of people stamping their feet as if to applaud
some unseen performer. Up to this my other friend had been walking
to and fro some yards off, but now he passed close to us, and as he did
so said suddenly that we were going to be interrupted, for he heard the
laughter of children somewhere beyond the rocks. We were, however,
quite alone. The spirits of the place had begun to cast their influence
over him also. In a moment he was corroborated by the girl, who said
that bursts of laughter had begun to mingle with the music, the confused
talking, and the noise of feet.

She next saw a bright light streaming out of the cave, which seemed to
have grown much deeper, and a quantity of little people,[FN#6] in
various coloured dresses, red predominating, dancing to a tune which she
did not recognize.

[FN#6] The people and faeries in Ireland are sometimes as big as we
are, sometimes bigger, and sometimes, as I have been told, about
three feet high.

The Old Mayo woman I so often quote, thinks that it is something
in our eyes that makes them seem big or little.

I then bade her call out to the queen of the little people to come
and talk with us. There was, however, no answer to her command. I
therefore repeated the words aloud myself, and in a moment a very
beautiful tall woman came out of the cave.

I too had by this time fallen into a kind of trance, in which what we
call the unreal had begun to take upon itself a masterful reality,
and was able to see the faint gleam of golden ornaments, the shadowy
blossom of dim hair.

I then bade the girl tell this tall queen to marshal her followers
according to their natural divisions, that we might see them. I found as
before that I had to repeat the command myself. The creatures then
came out of the cave, and drew themselves up, if I remember rightly, in
four bands. One of these bands carried quicken boughs in their hands,
and another had necklaces made apparently of serpents' scales, but
their dress I cannot remember, for I was quite absorbed in that
gleaming woman.
But his letter was full of warm, frank, brotherly congratulation and
good will.

The dinner at the Albert was in every way worthy of the club and of the
occasion, but Ranald was glad to get it over. He was eager to get away
from the city associated in his mind with so much that was painful.

At length the last speech was made, and the last song was sung, and the
men in a body marched to the station carrying their hero with them.
As they stood waiting for the train to pull out, a coachman in livery
approached little Merrill.

"A lady wishes to see Mr. Macdonald, sir," he said, touching his hat.

"Well, she's got to be quick about it," said Merrill. "Here, Glengarry,"
he called to Ranald, "a lady is waiting outside to see you, but I say,
old chap, you will have to make it short, I guess it will be sweet
enough."

"Where is she?" said Ranald to the coachman.

"In here, sir," conducting him to the ladies' waiting-room, and taking
his place at the door outside. Ranald hurried into the room, and there
stood Kate.

What the natives told D'Urville about it was in the main accurate. The
apteryx, with the tail of a fowl and a plumage of a reddish-brown,
has an affinity to the ostrich; it inhabits damp and gloomy woods,
and never comes out even in search of food except in the evening.

She stood up looking so
brave and proud, but in spite of her, her lips quivered.

"I have waited to see you so long," she said, "and now you are going
away again."

"Don't speak like that, Kate," said Ranald, "don't say those things. I
want to tell you how you have helped me these three lonely years, but I
can't, and you will never know, and now I am going back. I hardly dared
to see you, but I wish you everything that is good. I haven't seen Harry
either, but you will wish him joy for me. He is a very lucky fellow."

By this time Ranald had regained control of himself, and was speaking
in a tone of frank and brotherly affection. he pray's poem to can.

lips and the dark eyes shining with tears she was too brave to let fall,
he felt that he was fast losing his grip of himself.

"Oh, Kate," he cried, in a low, tense voice, "I must go. You have been
more to me than you will ever know. May you both be happy."

"Both?" echoed Kate, faintly.

"Yes," cried Ranald, hurriedly, "Harry will, I'm sure, for if any one
can make him happy, you can."

"I?" catching her breath, and beginning to laugh a little hysterically.

"What's the matter, Kate? You are looking white."

"Oh," cried Kate, her voice broken between a sob and a laugh, "won't
Harry and Lily enjoy this?"

Ranald gazed at her in fear as if she had suddenly gone mad.

"Lily?" he gasped.

"Merrill," said Ranald, solemnly, "tell the fellows I'm not going on
this train."

"Hoorah!" cried little Merrill, "I guess I'll tell 'em you are gone. May
I tell the fellows, Kate?"

"What?" said Kate, blushing furiously.

"Yes, Merrill," cried Ranald, in a voice strident with ecstasy, "you may
tell them. Tell the whole town."

Merrill rushed to the door. "I say, fellows," he cried, "look here."

The men came trooping at his call, but only to see Ranald and Kate
disappearing through the other door.

"He's not going," cried Merrill, "he's gone. By Jove! They've both
gone."

"I say, little man," said big Starry Hamilton, "call yourself together

"And you, you wretch, won't let me go on with the beautiful poem.

cried Starry Hamilton, as the carriage
drove away, and after the three cheers and the tiger, little Merrill's
voice led them in the old battle-cry, heard long ago on the river, but
afterward on many a hard-fought foot-ball field, "Glengarry forever!"
