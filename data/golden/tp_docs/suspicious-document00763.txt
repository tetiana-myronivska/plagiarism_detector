"O Christalan! my son," she answered him,
"Knighthood is in the spirit and the soul;
The deeds that show the knighthood to the world
Are but the chance and circumstance of fate;
And no knight could be truer than you proved
Yourself in self-forgetting, nor more brave
Than in foregoing knighthood for a knight.
You will be far more valiant, if you bear
This sorrow without murmur or complaint,
Than you could prove in any battle won.
At the left-hand corner is Daniel in the
lion's den, the lion opening his mouth in
six-eight time, and an angel with
outspread wings, but securely transfixed
through the loins by a revolving brass pivot, shutting it again
to the same lively movement.

To the right of Daniel is the Grand Turk,
seated in his divan, and brandishing a dagger
over a prostrate slave, who only ventures to rise when the dagger
is withdrawn.

Next to him is Nebuchadnezzar on all fours,
eating painted grass, with a huge gold crown
on his head, which he bobs for a bite every
other bar. In the right-hand corner is a
sort of cavern, the abode of some supernatural
and mysterious being of the fiend or vampire
school, who gives an occasional fitful start,
and turns an ominous-looking green glass-eye
out upon the spectators. All these are in the background.

In the front of the stage stands Napoleon, wearing
a long sword and cocked hat, and the conventional
gray smalls--his hand of course stuck in his
breast. At his right are Tippoo Saib
and his sons, and at his left, Queen
Victoria and Prince Albert.

After a score or so of bars, the measure
of the music suddenly alters--Daniel's guardian
angel flies off--the prophet and the lion
lie down to sleep together--the Grand Turk sinks into the arms of
the death-doomed slave.

Nebuchadnezzar falls prostrate on the ground,
and the fiend in the gloomy cavern whips
suddenly round and glares with his green
eye, as if watching for a spring upon the
front row of actors, who have now taken up their
cue and commenced their performance.
"List ye, Greane,"
He said one day with ardour of brave youth
Aglow for bravery; "I met a man
Who once had seen the great Sir Launcelot,
And told me of him. crack! bang! at a tremendous
crash of gongs and grumbling of bass-notes,
the fiend in the corner rushes forth from
his lair with a portentous howl. Away,
neck or nothing, flies Napoleon, and Tippoo
scampers after him, followed by the terrified
attendants; but lo! at the precise nick of time, Queen
Victoria draws a long sword from beneath
her stays, while up jumps the devouring
beast from the den of the prophet, and like a
true British lion--as he doubtless
was all the while--flies at the throat of the fiend, straight as
an arrow to its mark.And, Greane, bend down and let me speak to you:
I saw at Camelot the great white tomb
Of sweet Elaine, and not in all the court
Saw I a maiden half so fair as she.
She lies there carved in marble, pure and white;
And, by our blessed Lord, my heart is sure
That, were she living, I should love her well."

"O Christalan! you would not love a maid
That lost her maiden pride and dignity,
Giving her love unasked?" said Greane, in scorn.

"Alas, Greane! have you, hidden from the world,
Learned the world's jargon and false estimates?
Do you not know that love is more than pride,
And beating heart more than cold dignity?

Slowly the shadow on his way grew less
Eclipsing, the brave spirit that was ripe
For doing deeds came to fulfil itself
In the far harder task of doing naught,
The courage ready for activity
But changed its course, as he forebore and smiled
And yet he oft would hasten from the sight
Of Greane and Agathar, and seek the wood,
Where he was hidden from the tender eyes
So quick to see his struggle. Lying prone
Upon the grass, he stretched his fragile form
Its fullest length to cheat himself with thought
That he was stalwart, then he closed his eyes
To generous summer's lavish golden glow
Of shimmering sunshine playing everywhere,
And the fair world of beauty, flowering;
Shut from his hearing caroling of bird,
The liquid rhythm of rivulet, the song
Of wind amid the tree-tops, all the notes
Of nature's melody; and heard alone,
With inward ear, the clanging clash of arms
And shouts of victory  Through the long hours
He lay and fought his fight imaginary,
To rise, more wan, to wage his war with pain.

Spring on him unawares, and take his life,
And have revenge for justice done to them.

With arms uplifted and imploring eyes,
Until words come, between sharp gasps of pain.
