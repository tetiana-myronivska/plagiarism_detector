Now England is conscious why she entered the war. She knows now that
somebody else pushed her into this Avar, and that she is fighting for
somebody else's cause. She implored the blessing of the Queen of Heaven,
on herself, her fellow-laborers in the schools of Montreal, and her
present undertaking, and then set to work to accomplish her end. She
visited some of the old friends of M. de Maisonneuve, who were all
persons of merit and high social position, and were known to have much
influence at court, in order to induce them to procure her the favor of
an interview with his majesty. These people had not at all forgotten her,
and had several letters of recommendation in her favor.

They knew the good she was capable of effecting, and made it a point of
honor to assist her. The King was in due course of time informed of the
matter, and seemed to be rather favorably inclined to grant her
request, yet six weary months elapsed without his giving a decisive
answer. Learning that his majesty was at Dunkirk in the May of
1671, she repaired thither, to renew solicitations, and at last
obtained the long-sought letters, which contained Catholic sentiments
worthy of the great French monarch. Being authorized by the royal patent,
she next tried to procure a new corps of volunteers, who would, like
the first heroic band, generously renounce home, family, and country,
without hope of ever returning, who would be willing to cross the great
ocean, then but imperfectly known, and devote their future lives to the
instruction of wild savages, as much as to the advancement of the French
colonists, expecting also that the relentless Iroquois would repay their
Christian love with the tomahawk or the scalping-knife, and in those
days how often was the expectation verified. Yet these considerations
were precisely what attracted a great number of talented young
girls, fully capable of sustaining and perfecting the enterprise,
and worthy to share with the holy Foundress the labor, the glory,
and the success that awaited the Congregation in Ville-Marie.

She procured her postulants in the towns that lie scattered between
Troyes and Paris, and she as often travelled on foot carrying her
little bundle of poor clothing, as she did in the public conveyances,
that were disagreeable to her, because the roads were rough, and
the companions she met were frequently dissolute libertines, although
her modest exterior and edifying conversation frequently silenced
their licentious discourses.

Such silent
suffering is the severe judge of the world who makes all rich people
poor, all proud humble, all pleasure bitter, all human progress abased.
There is something wrong about this life. What may it be? I do not know,
but suffering reminds us every day that there is something wrong with
this world. Suffering from surrounding nature is not the worst,--nature
can be governed by us; nor the suffering from God,--God can be touched
by our prayer; but the worst of all is our suffering from ourselves.
Thousands and thousands of serpents live in Serbia. Yet all the
serpents throughout the Serbian history, from the time of the Druids on
this island till the time of Tennyson and Kipling, effected not such a
poisonous devastation of men and cattle in Serbia as lately a host of
invaders did, who boastfully regarded themselves to be at the summit of
human civilisation. But as the population increased the extent of her
foot-journeys covered a vast tract of country, and the number of
children she instructed was greater than one teacher could attend
to.
Although her strength and courage never flagged, she evidently required
assistance, which Almighty God provided in His own mysterious and
adorable manner, as will soon be related.

CHAPTER VII.

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SISTERS OF THE CONGREGATION OF NOTRE DAME AT
VILLE-MARIE.

Sister Bourgeois had now lived four years in Ville-Marie, during which
time she had practised the most heroic virtues. Her zeal for the glory
of God was ever increasing, her only desire being to win souls to His
service, and to love and imitate the virtues of His divine Mother. About
this period she felt interiorly inspired to build a church in honor of
Mary, in which she might at times assemble her little pupils for
instruction, in order to effect greater good among them. Hitherto
she had literally to run after them from house to house, which
unavoidably caused a great loss of her precious time. Yet, obedient
to the inspirations of grace, she first consulted her confessor,
Father Pizart, a Jesuit, who was then the only priest in Ville-Marie.
To test her firmness he represented and exaggerated the difficulties
she would have to encounter, but her zealous determination overcame
his objections, and he approved of her design, not doubting that
God would assist her to accomplish it.Yet Serbia is silent in her tragedy. I
myself would prefer to be silent too. But I cannot, being not only an
unhappy survivor of a horrible shipwreck, but above all a priest and
servant of God.

If our national pride bids us Serbs be silent in this shipwreck, my
Christian honour and pride bids me cry out and protest. I am a surviving
protest of my murdered country. CHAPTER XI. SISTER BOURGEOIS' HAPPY

dead were solemly chanted, while the celebrant carried the cherished
relic in his own hands to its final resting place, which was a
kind of niche, cut in stone, and placed it in the middle of the
long oriental panel of the choir, where the Sisters usually assembled
to perform their religious exercises.

There the heart of one of earth's noblest and purest daughters was deposited,
with aspergings and incense, after which the opening was securely
closed with a plate of lead, on which were engraven the following
words:--
"The heart that is covered by this stone Renounced the earth to
live for God alone, It had no other treasure than the band Of
Christian virgins, who at the command Left home and country for a
foreign land."Your working people possess a healthy sense of
