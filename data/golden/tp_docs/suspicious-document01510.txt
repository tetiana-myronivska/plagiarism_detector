"You's boun' to find it," directed auntie, "if you don't keah nuffin
'bout de road, and go fo' de sun-down."

A brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of the
camp, just as the stars came out.  Unfortunately, these views were not
disappointed: conviction, interest, or fear, prevailed on many to
take the oath; while doubt, worldly improvidence, or a scrupulous piety,
deterred others. A schism took place between the jurors and nonjurors--the
people became equally divided, and adhered either to the one or the
other, as their habits or prepossessions directed them. Neither party, as
it may be imagined, could see themselves deprived of any portion of the
public esteem, without concern, perhaps without rancour; and their
mutual animosity, far from gaining proselytes to either, contributed
only to the immediate degradation and future ruin of both.

Those, however, who had not taken the prescribed oath, were in general more
popular than what were called the constitutionalists, and the influence
they were supposed to exert in alienating the minds of their followers
from the new form of government, supplied the republican party
with a pretext for proposing their banishment.*
*The King's exertion of the power vested in him by the constitution,
by putting a temporary negative on this decree, it is well known,
was one of the pretexts for dethroning him.

At the King's deposition this decree took place, and such of the nonjuring
priests as were not massacred in the prisons, or escaped the search,
were to be embarked for Guiana. The wiser and better part of those
whose compliances entitled them to remain, were, I believe, far
from considering this persecution of their opponents as a triumph--to
those who did, it was of short duration.

The Convention, which had hitherto attempted to disguise its hatred of the
profession by censure and abuse of a part of its members, began now
to ridicule the profession itself: some represented it as useless--others
as pernicious and irreconcileable with political freedom; and a discourse*
was printed, under the sanction of the Assembly, to prove, that the only
feasible republic must be supported by pure atheism.
, It was the first time he had
ever slept on the ground.
