A life of this kind cannot fail to be of benefit to the health; and,
after all, the work of a healthy man is likely to be of greater value
than that of one who is anæmic or out of condition. The incident had
happened to himself, and he urged me to put it into verse, for humanity's
sake. The humbleness, meanness if you like, of the subject,
together with the homely mode of treating it, brought upon me a world of
ridicule by the small critics, so that in policy I excluded it from
many editions of my poems, till it was restored at the request
of some of my friends, in particular my son-in-law, Edward Quillinan.

It was only excluded from the editions of 1820, 1827, and 1832. In
the edition of 1807 it was placed amongst a group of "Poems composed
during a Tour, chiefly on foot." In 1815, in 1836, and afterwards,
it was included in the group "referring to the Period of Childhood."

In Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal, the following reference to
this poem occurs:

"Feb. 16, 1802.--Mr. Graham said he wished William had been with him
the other day. He was riding in a post-chaise, and he heard a strange
cry that he could not understand. The sound continued, and he called to
the chaise-driver to stop. It was a little girl that was crying
as if her heart would burst.

She had got up behind the chaise, and her cloak had been caught by the
wheel, and was jammed in, and it hung there. She was crying after it,
poor thing. Mr. Graham took her into the chaise, and her cloak
was released from the wheel, but the child's misery did not cease,
for her cloak was torn to rags. It had been a miserable cloak before;
but she had no other, and it was the greatest sorrow that could
befall her.

Her name was Alice Fell. She had no parents, and belonged to the
next town. At the next town Mr. G. left money to buy her a new cloak."

"Friday (March 12).--In the evening after tea William wrote 'Alice
Fell'."
"Saturday Morning (13th March).--William finished 'Alice Fell'...."

In the third place, a museum is a permanent exhibition for the
instruction of the public, and for the enlightenment of students
desirous of obtaining comparative knowledge in any one branch of their
work, and for this purpose it should be well supplied not so much with
original antiquities as with casts, facsimiles, models, and
reproductions of all sorts.

To be a serviceable exhibition both for the student and the public a
museum does not need to possess only original antiquities. I met
this woman near the Wishing-gate, on the high road that then led
from Grasmere to Ambleside. Her appearance was exactly as here
described, and such was her account, nearly to the letter.--I.F.]
One of the "Poems founded on the Affections."To do so is to encourage the
straying of other objects. The curator so often labours under the
delusion that it is his first business to collect together as large a
number as possible of valuable masterpieces. In reality that is a very
secondary matter. Met, and described to me by my sister, near the quarry

The following are Dorothy Wordsworth's references to this poem in her
Grasmere Journal. They justify the remark of the late Bishop of
Lincoln,
"his poems are sometimes little more than poetical versions of her
descriptions of the objects which she had seen, _and he treated them
as seen by himself_."I would not have had you up i. dogs in." See' Letters of Lamb'
