            The Monks of Catalonia
            The Cradle


                    THE MONKS OF CATALONIA


          TO you, my friends, allow me to detail,
          The feats of monks in Catalonia's vale,
          Where oft the holy fathers pow'rs displayed,
          And showed such charity to wife and maid,
          That o'er their minds sweet fascination reigned,
          And made them think, they Paradise had gained.

          And yet, as you embodied this Company
          to all these people, and so made for the
          fanatical loyalty that is destroying me, I
          suppose you and I are enemies!" He shrugged
          his shoulders whimsically and turned
          away.

          
          Thence he cast a fleeting glance out the
          window at the long reach of the Moose and the
          blue bay gleaming in the distance. He
          tried the outside door. It was locked. Taken
          with a new idea he proceeded at once to the third
          door of the apartment. It opened.
          

          He found himself in a small and much-littered
          room containing a desk, two chairs, a vast
          quantity of papers, a stuffed bird or so,
          and a row of account-books. Evidently the Factor's
          private office,
          Ned Trent returned to the main room and listened
          intently for several minutes. After that
          he ran back to the office and began hastily to open and rummage,
one after another, the drawers of the desk.

          He discovered and concealed several bits of
          string, a desk-knife, and a box of
          matches. Then he uttered a guarded
          exclamation of delight. He had found a small
          revolver, and with it part of a box of
          cartridges.
          
          "A chance!" he exulted: "a chance!"

          The game would be desperate. He would be forced
          first of all to seek out and kill the men detailed
          to shadow him--a toy revolver against
          rifles; white man against trained savages.
          And after that he would have, with the cartridges
          remaining, to assure his subsistence. Still
          it was a chance.
          
          He closed the drawers and the door, and resumed
          his seat in the arm-chair by the council
          table.
          
          For over an hour thereafter he awaited
          the next move in the game.
          He was already swinging up the pendulum
          arc. The case did not appear utterly hopeless. He resolved, through
Me-en-gan, whom he divined as a friend of the girl's, to smuggle a
message to Virginia bidding her hope. Already his imagination had
conducted him to Quebec, when in August he would search her out and
make her his own.
Soon one of the Indian servants entered the room for the purpose
of conducting him to a smaller apartment, where he was left alone
for some time longer. Food was brought him. He ate heartily, for
he considered that wise. Then at last the summons for which he had
been so long in readiness. Me-en-gan himself entered the room, and
motioned him to follow.
Ned Trent had already prepared his message on the back of an envelope,
writing ft with the lead of a cartridge. He now pressed the bit of
paper into the Indian's palm.

"For O-mi-mi," he explained.Four times a year, exactly to a day,
          Each wife this tithe should personally pay
          Our holy saint requires that you submit:
          'Tis founded on decrees of holy writ.
          All Nature carefully the law reveres,
          That gratitude and fealty endears.

          NOW marriage works we rank as an estate,
          And tithe is due for that at any rate.
          We'll take it patiently, whate'er the toil:
          Nor be o'er nice about the justful spoil.
          Our order have not, you must surely know,
          By many comforts, what we wish below.

          'TIS right, however, that I now suggest,
          Whatever passes must not be expressed;
          But naught to husbands, parents, friends, reveal;
          From ev'ry one the mysterious conceal.
          Three words th' apostle taught: be these your care;
          FAITH, CHARITY, and PRUDENCE learn to share.

          To Columbus, passing out at sea on his
          first voyage, the cloudcap appeared shining
          like burnished silver in the morning sun.
          He took it to be snow until closer
          investigation disclosed its true nature, whereupon
          he named the mountain Monte Plata, or Silver
          Mount, and the port at the base was afterwards
          called Puerto Plata. The mountain is said to
          have been given its present name, Isabel de
          Torres, in honor of the wife of a prominent
          settler, Diego de Ocampo, domiciled in
          Santiago in the early days, after whom the great
          mountain near that city was named. According
          to a local legend, this couple, although
          blessed with worldly goods, was also mutually
          possessed of such a nagging spirit and
          ungovernable temper that a separation became
          necessary, the husband remaining in
          Santiago, the wife removing to Puerto Plata.
          When leagues intervened between them their conduct
          was so charming that the inhabitants of the
          two cities gave their names to the high mountains
          near the respective towns. "If you doubt the
          story," the legend concludes, "there are the mountains to prove
it."

          The principal mountain range, the Cordillera
          Central, begins at the extreme eastern point
          of the island, traverses the center of
          the Republic, crosses into Haitian territory
          and sinks into the sea at Mole St. Nicolas
          to reappear in Cuba, on the other side of
          the Windward Passage. It constitutes a part
          of the great ridge which forms the
          backbone of all the islands bounding the Caribbean
          Sea on the north. In the eastern part of Santo Domingo
          the range consists merely of a chain of
          high hills which rarely reach an altitude
          of more than 900 feet, but in the center and west
          of the Republic it assumes much greater magnitude, sending out
branches which are important mountain chains in themselves, and
several of its peaks are over 6000 feet in height.

          The highest point in the island and in the
          West Indies is Mt.
          Tina, with an altitude of 10,300 feet, a
          magnificent outpost of that branch of the
          central range which traverses the
          south-central portion of the Republic. The
          next highest point, is Yaque Peak, 9700
          feet high, nearly at the center of the
          island. The dense jungle covering the
          rugged slopes of these giants has so far baffled
          the few attempts at exploration of their
          summits. To the west of Yaque Peak is Mt.
          Cucurucho, 7400 feet high, and to the
          northwest Mt. Entre los Rios, 8000 feet and
          Mt. Gallo, 8200 feet in height. It must be
          remembered that in the absence of any
          careful measurements, the altitudes
          given are mere approximations.
The Cordillera Central is peculiar in its numerous branches which
are often more intricate in their ramifications and comprise loftier
peaks than the parent range. The most important of these branches
are those which extend from Mt. Banilejo to the southern coast, and
fill the district between San Cristobal and Azua with a jumble of
mountains.
Besides Mt. Tina, already mentioned, their principal peaks are Mt.
Rio Grande, 6900 feet, overlooking the beautiful Constanza Valley,
and Mt.IT happened that one night a married dame,
          Desirous to convey the monks their claim,
          And walking with her spouse just by the spot,
          Where dwelled the arch contrivers of the plot,
          Good Heavens! said she, I well remember now,
          I've business with a friar here, I vow;
          'Twill presently be done if you'll but wait;
          Religious duties we must ne'er abate.
          What duties? cried the husband with surprise;
          You're surely mad:--'tis midnight I surmise;
          Confess yourself to-morrow if required;
          The holy fathers are to bed retired.
          That makes no difference, the lady cried.--
          I think it does, the husband straight replied,
          And thither I'll not let you go to-night:--
          What heinous sins so terribly affright,
          That in such haste the mind you wish to ease?
          To-morrow morn repair whene'er you please:

          YOU do me wrong, rejoined the charming fair;
          I neither want confession nor a prayer,
          But anxiously desire what is due to pay;
          For if incautiously I should delay,
          Long time 'would be ere I the monk should see,
          With other matters he'll so busy be.

          While others would the place with fire surround,
          And burn the house with those within it found.
          Some wished to drown them, bound within their dress;
          With various other projects you may guess;
          But all agreed that death should be their lot,
          And those for burning had most voices got.

          A citizen his barn for this arranged;
          The crafty crew together were confined,
          And in the blaze their wretched lives resigned,
          While round the husbands danced at sound of drum,
          And burnt whatever to their hands had come;
          Naught 'scaped their fury, monks of all degrees,
          Robes, mantles, capuchins, and mock decrees:
