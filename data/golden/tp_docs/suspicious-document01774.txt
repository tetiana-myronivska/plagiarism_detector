CHAPTER 6. HEAVY GALES. In all its bearings, tendencies, and effects,
           it is directly contrary and powerfully hostile to any such system.

EQUALITY OF RIGHTS, the doctrine asserts; and this necessarily opens
the way for _variety of condition_.

In other words, every child of Adam has, from the Creator, the
inalienable right of wielding, within reasonable limits, his own
powers, and employing his own resources, according to his own
choice;--the right, while he respects his social relations, to
promote as he will his own welfare.

But mark--HIS OWN powers and resources, and NOT ANOTHER'S, are thus
inalienably put under his control.

The Creator makes every man free, in whatever he may do, to exert
            HIMSELF, and not another.

Here no man may lawfully cripple or embarrass another.

The feeble may not hinder the strong, nor may the strong crush the
feeble.

Every man may make the most of himself, in his own proper sphere. Now,
            as in the constitutional endowments; and natural opportunities,
and lawful acquisitions of mankind, infinite variety prevails, so
in exerting each HIMSELF, in his own sphere, according to his own
choice, the variety of human condition can be little less than
infinite.

Thus equality of rights opens the way for variety of condition.

But with all this variety of make, means, and condition, considered
individually, the children of Adam are bound together by strong
ties which can never be dissolved.

They are mutually united by the social of their nature.

Hence mutual dependence and mutual claims.

While each is inalienably entitled to assert and enjoy his own personality
            as a man, each sustains to all and all to each, various relations.

While each owns and honors the individual, all are to own and honor
the social of their nature.

Now, the Golden Rule distinctly recognizes, lays its requisitions upon, and
            extends its obligations to, the whole nature of man, in his
individual capacities and social relations.

What higher honor could it do to man, as _an individual_, than to
constitute him the judge, by whose decision, when fairly rendered,
all the claims of his fellows should be authoritatively and definitely
disposed of?

"Whatsoever YE WOULD" have done to you, so do ye to others.

Every member of the family of Adam, placing himself in the position here
            pointed out, is competent and authorized to pass judgment on all
the cases in social life in which he may be concerned.

Could higher responsibilities or greater confidence be reposed in men
            individually?

And then, how are their _claims upon each other_ herein magnified!

What inherent worth and solid dignity are ascribed to the social
of their nature!

In every man with whom I may have to do, I am to recognize the
            presence of _another self_, whose case I am to make _my own_.

And thus I am to dispose of whatever claims he may urge upon me.
            

Thus, in accordance with the Golden Rule, mankind are naturally
brought, in the voluntary use of their powers and resources, to
promote each other's welfare.

As his contribution to this great object, it is the inalienable
birthright of every child of Adam, to consecrate whatever he may
possess.

With exalted powers and large resources, he has a natural claim to a
            correspondent field of effort.

If his "abilities" are small, his task must be easy and his burden
light.

Thus the Golden Rule requires mankind mutually to serve each other.

In this service, each is to exert _himself_--employ _his own_ powers,
lay out his own resources, improve his own opportunities.

A division of labor is the natural result. One is remarkable for his
            intellectual endowments and acquisitions; another, for his wealth;
and a third, for power and skill in using his muscles.

Such attributes, endlessly varied and diversified, proceed from the
basis of a _common character_, by virtue of which all men and
each--one as truly as another--are entitled, as a birthright, to
"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

Each and all, one as well as another, may choose his own modes of
contributing his share to the general welfare, in which his own is
involved and identified.

            England for years he
had seemed to hold in the hollow of his hand. The Dutch, at the beginning
of their great struggle for freedom, appeared even to themselves to be
embarking upon a hopeless task. Yet from their desperate struggle England
and Holland rose up two mighty nations full of genius for commerce and
for war, while Spain had already advanced far along that path of decline
which led rapidly to the extinction of her preeminence in Europe and the
loss of her colonies beyond the seas.

By the daring genius of Drake and the great English seamen of the age of
Elizabeth the field of operations was transferred from the Channel to the
American coast. The sack of Spanish towns and the spoil of treasure ships
enriched the adventurers, whose methods were closely akin to piracy, and
who rarely paused to ask whether the two countries were formally at war.
"No peace beyond the line" was a rule of action that scarcely served to
cloak successful piracy. In Spanish eyes it was, not without reason,
wholly unjustifiable.

The colonial policy of Spain was calculated to raise up everywhere a host
of enemies. In her mistaken anxiety to keep all the wealth of her
colonies to herself she prohibited the rest of the world from engaging in
trade with them. Only with her might they buy and sell. The result was
that a great smuggling trade sprang up. No watchfulness could defeat the
daring and ingenuity of the English, Dutch, and French sailors who
frequented the Caribbean Sea. No threats could prevent the colonists from
attempting to buy and sell in the market that paid them best. The
ferocious vengeance of the Spaniards, which in some cases almost
exterminated the population of their own colonies, converted the traders
into the Buccaneers, an association of sailors of all nations who
established themselves in one of the islands of the Caribbean Sea, and
who for three-quarters of a century were the scourge of the Spanish trade
and dominions. Their cruelty was as remarkable as their skill and daring.
They spared neither man, nor woman, nor child. Even half a century after
their association had been broken up the memory of their inhuman
barbarity was so vivid that no Spanish prisoner ever mounted Anson's deck
without a lively dread, which was only equalled by the general surprise
at his kindly and courteous treatment. The sight of an English sailor
woke terror in every heart.

At last, in 1713, by the Treaty of Utrecht, that closed the famous War of
the Spanish Succession, in which Marlborough gained his wonderful
victories, Spain consented to resign her claim to a monopoly of trade
with her colonies so far as to permit one English ship a year to visit
the American coasts. The latter, in his reply, stated, that "two chiefs,
who had brought her off for the purpose of security, not of violence to
her person, disputed which should be her guard, and in a fit of savage
passion in one, from whose hands she was snatched, the unhappy woman
became the victim."]
We have in a preceding chapter described the monument, on Queenstown
Heights, to the memory of Sir Isaac Brock, a monument which "the
popularity of the general had caused to be regarded with more affectionate
veneration than any other structure in the province." On Good Friday,
the 17th of April, 1840,[141] a miscreant of the name of Lett introduced
a quantity of gunpowder into this monument with the fiendish purpose
of destroying it; and the explosion, effected by a train, caused so
much damage as to render the column altogether irreparable. Lett, who was
by birth an Irishman and by settlement a Canadian, had been compelled
to fly into the United States for his share in the recent rebellion;
and "well knowing the feeling of attachment to the name and memory
of General Brock, as pervading all classes of Canadians, he sought
to gratify his own malicious and vindictive spirit, and at the same
time to wound and insult the people of Upper Canada" by this demon's
deed.

The universal indignation of that people was aroused, and a public
meeting was appointed to be held on Queenstown Heights, on the 30th
of July following, for the purpose of adopting resolutions for the
erection of another monument, the gallant Sir Allan Mac Nab especially
making the most stirring exertions to promote this great object.

The gathering, as it was called, was observed in Toronto (late
York) as a solemn holiday; the public offices were closed, and all
business was suspended; while thousands flocked from every part of the
province to testify their affection for the memory of one who, nearly
thirty years before, had fallen in its defence! History, indeed, affords
few parallels of such long cherished public attachment. "Steam vessels,
engaged for the occasion, left their respective ports of Kingston and
Coburg, of Hamilton and Toronto, in time to arrive at the entrance of
the Niagara river about ten o'clock in the forenoon. The whole of these,
ten in number, then formed in line, and ascended the river abreast, with
the government steamer, containing the lieutenant-governor, Sir George
Arthur, and his staff, leading the way. The British shore was lined with
thousands, and the fleet of steamers filled with hundreds, each
shouting and responding to the cheers of welcome from ship to shore,
and from shore to ship again.

The landing being effected, the march to the ground was accompanied
by military guards, and a fine military band. The public meeting was then
held in the open air, near the foot of the monument, and Sir
George Arthur was in the chair. The resolutions were moved, and speeches
made, by some of the most eminent and most eloquent men, holding
high official stations in the province;[142] and considering that amidst
this grand and imposing assemblage, there were a great number of veteran
officers of the Canada militia, who had fought and bled with the
lamented chief, whose memory they were assembled to honor, and whose
monument they had come to re-establish over his remains, the
enthusiasm with which the whole mass was animated may readily be
conceived; while the grand and picturesque combination of natural
objects of scenery, beheld from the heights on which they were met,
and the brightness of the day, added greatly to the effect of the
whole."

The gathering[143] was attended by about 8,000 persons, and the animation
of the scene was increased by a detachment of royal artillery, who fired
a salute; by a detachment of the 1st dragoon guards, with their bright
helmets glittering in the sun; and by the 93d regiment, (Highlanders,)
in full costume.

There were altogether eleven resolutions, of which the fifth was the
following:

Resolved,--That we recall to mind, with admiration and gratitude, the
perilous times in which Sir Isaac Brock led the small regular force, the
loyal and gallant militia, and the brave and faithful Indian warriors,
to oppose the invaders--when his fortitude inspired courage, and his
sagacious policy gave confidence, in despite of a hostile force,
apparently overwhelming.

We cannot refrain from transferring to these pages parts of the long and
eloquent speech of the chief justice, Robinson, who, on advancing to
the front of the hustings to move the sixth resolution, was received
with the most enthusiastic cheers.

If it were intended by those who committed this shameful outrage,
that the injury should be irreparable, the scene which is now before
us, on these interesting heights, shews that they little understood
the feelings of veneration for the memory of BROCK which still dwell
in the hearts of the people of Upper Canada.

No man ever established a better claim to the affections of a country; and,
in recalling the recollections of eight and twenty years, there is no
difficulty in accounting for the feeling which has brought us together
on this occasion.

Among the many who are assembled here from all parts of this province,
I know there are some who saw, as I did, with grief, the body of
the lamented general borne from the field on which he fell--and
many who witnessed, with me, the melancholy scene of his interment
in one of the bastions of Fort George.[144] They can never, I am
sure, forget the countenances of the soldiers of that gallant
regiment which he had long commanded, when they saw deposited in
the earth the lamented officer who had for so many years been their
pride; they can never forget the feelings displayed by the loyal
militia of this province, when they were consigning to the grave
the noble hero who had so lately achieved a glorious triumph in the
defence of their country: they looked forward to a dark and perilous
future, and they felt that the earth was closing upon him in whom,
more than in all other human means of defence, their confidence had
been reposed.

Nor can they forget the countenances, oppressed with grief, of those
brave and faithful Indian warriors, who admired and loved the gallant
Brock, who had bravely shared with him the dangers of that period,
and who had most honorably distinguished themselves in the field,
where he closed his short but brilliant career

.

* * * * *

It has, I know, Sir, in the many years that have elapsed, been sometimes
objected, that General Brock's courage was greater than his
prudence--that his attack of Fort Detroit, though it succeeded, was
most likely to have, failed, and was therefore injudicious--and that a
similar rashness and want of cool calculation were displayed in the manner
of his death.

Those who lived in Upper Canada while these events were passing, can form
a truer judgment; they know that what may to some seem rashness, was,
in fact, prudence; unless, indeed, the defence of Canada was to be
abandoned, in the almost desperate circumstances in which General Brock
was placed. He had with him but a handful of men, who had never been used
to military discipline--few, indeed, that had ever seen actual service
in the field; and he knew it must be some months before any considerable
reinforcement could be sent to him. He felt, therefore, that if he could
not impress upon the enemy this truth, that--wherever a major-general
of the British army, with but a few gallant soldiers of the line, and of
the brave defenders of the soil, could be assembled against them--they
must retire from the land which they had invaded, his cause was
hopeless. If he had begun to compare numbers, and had reserved his small
force in order to make a safer effort on a future day, then would thousands
upon thousands of the people of the neighbouring States have been found
pouring into the western portions of this province; and when at last our
mother country could send, as it was certain she would, her armies to our
assistance, they would have had to expend their courage and their
strength in taking one strong position after another, that had
been erected by the enemy within our own territory.

And at the moment when the noble soldier fell, it is true, he fell in
discharging a duty which might have been committed to a subordinate
hand; true, he might have reserved himself for a more deliberate
and stronger effort; but he felt that hesitation might be ruin--that
all depended upon his example of dauntless courage--of fearless
self-devotion.

Had it pleased Divine Providence to spare his invaluable life, who
will say that his effort would have failed? It is true his gallant course
was arrested by a fatal wound--such is the fortune of war; but the people
of Canada did not feel that his precious life was therefore thrown away,
deeply as they deplored his fall. In later periods of the contest, it
sometimes happened that the example of General Brock was not very closely
followed. It was that cautious calculation, which some suppose he
wanted, which decided the day against us at Sackett's Harbour--it was
the same cautious calculation which decided the day at Plattsburg; but
no monuments have been erected to record the triumphs of those fields--it
is not thus that trophies are won.

The Hon. Mr. Justice Macaulay, in moving the third resolution, thus elegantly
expressed himself:

It was not my good fortune to serve in the field under the illustrious
Brock, but I was under his command for a short period, when
commandant of the garrison of Quebec, thirty years ago, and well
remember his congratulating me upon receiving a commission in the
army, accompanied with good wishes for my welfare, which I shall
never forget.

I feel myself a humble subaltern still when called upon to address such
an auditory, and upon such a topic as the memory of Brock. Looking at the
animated mass covering these heights in 1840, to do further honour
to the unfortunate victim of a war now old in history, one is
prompted to ask, how it happens that the gallant general, who has
so long slept the sleep of death, left the lasting impression on
the hearts of his countrymen which this scene exhibits; how comes
it that the fame of Brock thus floats down the stream of time,
broad, deep, and fresh as the waters of the famed river with whose
waters, it might be almost said, his life's blood mingled?

In reply, we might dwell upon his civil and military virtues, his patriotic
self-devotion, his chivalrous gallantry, and his triumphant achievements.
(Here one of the auditors added, "and that he was an honest man"--an
attribute most warmly responded to on every side, for an honest man
is the noblest work of God.)

Still it might be asked, What peculiar personal qualities predominated
and gave him the talismanic influence and ascendancy over his fellow
men, which he acquired and wielded for his country's good? I answer,
Are there any seamen among you? (Yes, yes, answered from the crowd)--then
I say it was the Nelsonian spirit that animated his breast; it was
the mind intuitively to conceive, and the soul promptly to dare, incredible
things to feeble hearts--with a skill and bearing which infused this
chivalrous and enterprising spirit into all his followers, and
impelled them energetically to realize whatever he boldly led the
way to accomplish.

It displayed itself too, not only in the ranks of the disciplined
soldiers, but in those also of the untrained militia of Upper
Canada, as was amply proved on this memorable ground. Such were
the shining and conspicuous qualities of the man that have rendered
very dear his memory and his fame. Gentlemen, the resolution which
I hold in my hand is expressive of the indignation felt throughout the
province at the lawless act, the effects of which are visible before
us.

After the resolutions had been carried by acclamation, and the public
proceedings had terminated, 600 persons sat down to dinner in a temporary
pavilion erected on the spot where the hero fell, "Chief Justice Robinson
presiding; and at this, as at the morning meeting, great eloquence
was displayed in the speeches, great loyalty evinced in the feelings,
and great enthusiasm prevailed." After the queen's health had
been drunk, the chief justice rose and said:

I have now to propose the memory of the late gallant Sir Isaac Brock, of
Colonel M'Donell, and those who fell with them on Queenstown Heights. That
portion of you, gentlemen, who were inhabitants of Upper Canada while
General Brock served in its defence, are at no loss to account for the
enthusiastic affection with which his memory is cherished among us.

It was not merely on account of his intrepid courage and heroic firmness,
neither was it solely because of his brilliant success while he
lived, nor because he so nobly laid down his life in our defence; it was,
I think, that he united in his person, in a very remarkable degree, some
qualities which are peculiarly calculated to attract the confidence and
affection of mankind,--there was, in all he said and did, that
honesty of character which was so justly ascribed to him by a
gentleman who proposed one of the resolutions,--there was an
inflexible integrity, uncommon energy and decision, which always
inspire confidence and respect,--a remarkable union in his whole
demeanour of benevolence and firmness,--a peculiarly commanding and
soldierlike appearance,--a generous, frank, and manly bearing,--and,
above all, an entire devotion to his country.

In short, I believe I shall best convey my own impression, when I say it
would have required much more courage to refuse to follow General Brock,
than to go with him wherever he would lead.

"The meeting presented a proud display of high and noble feelings,
honorable to the memory of the dead, and equally so to the character of
the living. It was conducted with great dignity and judgment, and no
accident occurred to interrupt the pleasures of the day; the steam
vessels re-embarking their passengers soon after sun-set, and conveying
back the individuals composing this congregated multitude to their respective
homes in safety."[145]
It having been resolved by the meeting that the most suitable monument,
to replace the shattered column, would be an obelisk on the site of the
mutilated structure, the committee offered a premium for a design, which,
in February, 1843, was awarded to Mr. T. Young, architect to the
university of king's college, Toronto.

The style of the intended obelisk is the simplest and purest Egyptian, the
artist having strictly avoided all minuteness of detail in order that
the massive proportions of the design might harmonize with the bold
and beautiful scenery by which it will be surrounded. The total height
of the base, pedestal, and obelisk, will be 120 feet.

The obelisk will measure at the lower base 16 feet 6 inches square,
diminishing to 10 feet at the base of the upper, the proportions
of that known as Cleopatra's needle having been strictly adhered to.

The estimated cost of this obelisk is about £5,000 currency, the materials
of the old monument being used as far as possible; and as above £4,000[146]
have already been contributed, it is expected that the new structure will
be commenced in the spring of 1845.[147]
A concluding notice of Sir Isaac Brock's favorite regiment will
scarcely be deemed superfluous, although, as the records of the 49th were
destroyed at the evacuation of Fort George, in May, 1813, we
cannot give many further details of its services previous to that period.
In 1759, it assisted at the reduction of Fort Niagara, then held by the
French, (page 160,) and it served in the American revolutionary war, as,
by the records still existing, the flank companies were to be permitted
to wear, the grenadiers a black, and the light company a red, feather,
for services at Bunker's Hill; but the books being lost, the regiment
cannot shew the authority, and consequently is not allowed this distinction.

The 49th was repeatedly engaged in Upper Canada, and was especially
distinguished at the battles of Stoney Creek and Chrystler's Farm.

In 1815, the regiment returned to England, after an absence of above thirteen
years; and in January, 1816, "in consequence of its doing duty
over her royal highness the princess Charlotte of Wales, at Weymouth,
she was graciously pleased to nominate it her regiment."

In December,
1821, the 49th embarked for the Cape of Good Hope, and in 1828
proceeded on to Bengal.

In April, 1840, the regiment embarked for China, where it distinguished
itself, and suffered much from climate.

In gaining possession of the heights which overlook the city of Canton,
on the 25th May, 1841, "as the two brigades advanced together, there
was some little rivalry between the 49th and 18th regiments, as to which
should have the honor of commencing the attack upon the two forts.
The 49th, having the advantage of a shorter and perhaps rather better
road, got the lead, which they maintained; so that the left brigade carried
BOTH the eastern forts before the 18th came up, and with little loss."[148]
In February, 1843, after the Chinese had been coerced into a peace, the
49th returned to Calcutta, and the following month embarked for
England, where the head quarters arrived on the 24th August, after an
absence of nearly twenty-two years--an example of the arduous services
in which the British infantry of the line is constantly engaged. The 49th,
(the Princess Charlotte of Wales',) or Hertfordshire regiment, bears on
its colours and appointments the distinctions of Egmont op Zee, Copenhagen,
Queenstown, the Dragon, and China.

On the 27th August, 1844, new colours were presented to the 49th, at
Winchester, by Lady Pakenham, the wife of Major-General the Hon. Sir
Hercules Pakenham, commanding the district, the colours being first
consecrated by Doctor C. R. Sumner, the Lord Bishop of Winchester, who
thus addressed the troops:

Soldiers of the 49th, I have solicited and obtained permission of your
gallant commanding officer to address you a few moments before I invoke
the blessing of Almighty God upon the colours which are never to be
sullied by any act of yours, and are not to be abandoned but with
life itself.

And let not any man marvel that I, a man of peace, come among you, who
are men of war, for I hold that there is not a truer man of peace than a
Christian soldier.
Estevan had lost in like manner half her hands
when she anchored in the Bay of Barragan. The Esperanza, a 50-gun ship,
was still more unfortunate, for of 450 hands which she brought from Spain
only 55 remained alive.

By removing the masts of the Esperanza into the Asia, and making use of
what spare masts and yards they had on board, they made a shift to refit
the Asia and the St. Estevan, and in the October following Pizarro was
preparing to put to sea with these two ships in order to attempt the
passage round Cape Horn a second time, but the St. Estevan, in coming
down the River of Plate, ran on a shoal and beat off her rudder, on
which, and other damages she received, she was condemned and broke up,
and Pizarro in the Asia proceeded to sea without her. Having now the
summer before him and the winds favourable, no doubt was made of his
having a fortunate and speedy passage; but being off Cape Horn and going
right before the wind in very moderate weather, though in a swelling sea
by some misconduct of the officer of the watch the ship rolled away her
masts and was a second time obliged to put back to the River of Plate in
great distress.

The Asia having considerably suffered in this second unfortunate
expedition the Esperanza which had been left behind at Monte Video, was
ordered to be refitted, the command of her being given to Mindinuetta,
who was captain of the Guipuscoa when she was lost. He, in the November
of the succeeding year that is, in November, 1742, sailed from the River
of Plate for the South Seas and arrived safe on the coast of Chile where
his Commodore, Pizarro, passing overland from Buenos Ayres met him. There
were great animosities and contests between these two gentlemen at their
meeting occasioned principally by the claim of Pizarro to command the
Esperanza, which Mindinuetta had brought round, for Mindinuetta refused
to deliver her up to him, insisting that as he came into the South Seas
alone, and under no superior, it was not now in the power of Pizarro to
resume that authority which he had once parted with. However the
President of Chile interposing, and declaring for Pizarro, Mindinuetta
after a long and obstinate struggle, was obliged to submit.

But Pizarro had not yet completed the series of his adventures, for when
he and Mindinuetta came back by land from Chile to Buenos Ayres in the
year 1745 they found at Monte Video the Asia, which near three years
before they had left there. This ship they resolved, if possible, to
carry to Europe, and with this view they refitted her in the best manner
they could; but their great difficulty was to procure a sufficient number
of hands to navigate her, for all the remaining sailors of the squadron
to be met with in the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres did not amount to a
hundred men. They endeavoured to supply this defect by pressing many of
the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres, and putting on board besides all the
English prisoners then in their custody, together with a number of
Portuguese smugglers whom they had taken at different times, and some of
the Indians of the country. Among these last there was a chief and ten of
his followers who had been surprised by a party of Spanish soldiers about
three months before. The name of this chief was Orellana; he belonged to
a very powerful tribe which had committed great ravages in the
neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres. With this motley crew (all of them except
the European Spaniards extremely averse to the voyage) Pizarro set sail
from Monte Video, in the River of Plate about the beginning of November,
1745, and the native Spaniards, being no strangers to the dissatisfaction
of their forced men treated both the English prisoners and the Indians
with great insolence and barbarity, but more particularly the Indians;
for it was common for the meanest officers in the ship to beat them most
cruelly on the slightest pretences, and often times only to exert their
superiority. If the people and the courts of the land do not
know what they themselves mean, who has authority to settle their meaning
for them?

If the Constitution is not what history, unbroken practice, and the courts
prove that our fathers intended to make it, and what too, their
descendants, this nation say they did make it, and agree to uphold,--who
shall decide what the Constitution is?

This is the sense then in which the Nation understand that the promise is
made to them. The Nation _understand_ that the judge pledges himself to
return fugitive slaves.

The judge knows this when he takes the oath.

And Paley expresses the opinion of all writers on morals, as well as
the conviction of all honest men, when he says, "that a promise is
binding in that sense in which the promiser thought at the time that the
other party understood it."

OBJECTION II.

A promise to do an immoral act is not binding: therefore an oath to
support the Constitution of the United States, does not bind one to
support any provisions of that instrument which are repugnant to his
ideas of right.

And an abolitionist, thinking it wrong to return slaves, may as an
office-holder, innocently and properly take an oath to support a
Constitution which commands such return.

ANSWER.

Observe that this objection allows the Constitution to be pro-slavery,
and admits that there are clauses in it which no abolitionist ought to
carry out or support.

And observe, further, that we all agree, that a bad promise is better broken
than kept--that every abolitionist, who has before now taken the
oath to the Constitution, is bound to break it, and disobey the pro-slavery
clauses of that instrument. So far there is no difference between
us. But the point in dispute now is, whether a man, having found out that
certain requirements of the Constitution are wrong, can, after that,
innocently swear to support and obey them, _all the while meaning not to
do so_.

Now I contend that such loose construction of our promises is contrary
alike to honor, to fair dealing, and to truthfulness--that it tends to
destroy utterly that confidence between man and man which binds society
together, and leads, in matters of government, to absolute tyranny.

The Constitution is a series of contracts made by each individual
with every other of the fourteen millions. A man's oath is evidence
of his assent to this contract. If I offer a man the copy of an agreement,
and he, after reading, swears to perform it, have I not a right to infer
from his oath that he assents to the _rightfulness_ of the articles of
that paper? What more solemn form of expressing his assent could he
select? A man's oath expresses his conviction of the rightfulness of the
actions he promises to do, as well as his determination to do them. If
this be not so, I can have no trust in any man's word. He may take my
money, promise to do what I wish in return, and yet, keeping my money,
tell me, on the morrow, that he shall not keep his promise, and
never meant to, because the act, his conscience tells him, is wrong. Who
would trust property to such men, or such maxims in the common affairs
of life? Shall we not be as honest in the Senate House as on 'Change? The
North makes a contract with the South by which she receives certain
benefits, and agrees to render certain services. The benefits she
carefully keeps--but the services she refuses to render, because immoral
contracts are not binding!

Is this fair dealing? It is the rule alike of law and common sense,
that if we are not able, from _any cause_, to furnish the article we
have agreed to, we ought to return the pay we have received. If power
is put into our hands on certain conditions, and we find ourselves unable
to comply with those conditions, we ought to surrender the power
back to those who gave it.

Immoral laws are doubtless void, and should not be obeyed. But
the question is here, whether one knowing a law to be immoral, may
innocently promise to obey it in order to get into office? The people have
settled the conditions on which one may take office. The first is, that
he assent to their Constitution. Is it honest to accept power with the
intention at the time of not keeping the conditions?--The rightfulness
of those conditions is not here the question.

OBJECTION III.

I swear to support the Constitution, _as I understand it_.

Certain parts of it, in my opinion, contradict others and are therefore
void.

ANSWER. Will any one take the title deed of his house and carry
it to the man he bought of, and let him keep the covenants of that paper
as he says "he understands them?" Do we not all recognize the justice
of having some third, disinterested party to judge between two disputants
about the meaning of contracts? Who ever heard of a contract of which
each party was at liberty to keep as much as he thought proper?

As in all other contracts, so in that of the Constitution, there is a
power provided to affix the proper construction to the instrument, and
that construction both parties are bound to abide by, or repudiate the
_whole_ contract. That power is the Supreme Court of the United
States.

Do we seek the common sense, practical view of this question? Go to the
Exchange and ask any broker how many dollars he will trust any man with,
who avows his right to make promises with the design, at the time, of
breaking some parts, and not feeling called upon to state
which those parts will be?

Do you seek the moral view of the point, which philosophers have
taken? Paley says, "A promise is binding in that sense in which the
promiser thought at the time of making that the other party understood
it." Is there any doubt what meaning the great body of the American people
attach to the Constitution and the official oath?
They are that party to whom the promise is made.

But, say some, our lives are notice to the whole people what meaning we
attach to the oath, and we will protest when we swear, that we do not
include in our oath the pro-slavery clauses. You may as well utter the
protest now, as when you are swearing--or at home, equally as well as
within the State House. For no such protest can be of any avail.
The Chief Justice stands up to administer to me the oath of some office,
no matter which. "Sir," say I, "I must take that oath with a
qualification, excluding certain clauses." His reply will be, "Sir, I
have no discretion in this matter. I am here merely to administer
a prescribed form of oath.

If you assent to it, you are qualified for your station. If you do
not, you cannot enter. I have no authority given me to listen to exceptions.
I am a servant--the people are my masters--here is what they require
that you support, not this or that part of the Constitution, but
'_the Constitution_,' that is, the _whole_."

Baffled here, I turn to the people. I publish my opinions in
newspapers.

I proclaim
them at conventions, I spread them through the country on the wings
of a thousand presses.

Does this avail me?

Yes, says Liberty party, if after this, men choose to vote for you, it
is evident they mean you shall take the oath as you have given notice
that you understand it.

Well, the voters in Boston, with this understanding, elect me
to Congress, and I proceed to Washington. But here arises a difficulty,--my
constituents at home have assented--but when I get to Congress, I
find I am not the representative of Boston only, but of the whole
country.

The interests of Carolina are committed to my hands as well as those
of Massachusetts; I find that the contract I made by my oath was not
with Boston, but with the whole nation.

It is the _nation_ that gives me the power to declare war and make peace--to
lay taxes on cotton, and control the commerce of New Orleans. The nation
prescribed the conditions in 1789, when the Constitution was
settled, and though Boston may be willing to accept me on other
terms, Carolina is not willing.

Boston has accepted my protest, and says, "Take office."

Carolina says, "The oath you swear is sworn to me, as well as to the rest--I
demand the whole bond." In other words, when I have made my protest,
what evidence is there that _the nation_, the other party to the contract,
assents to it?
There can be none until that nation amends its Constitution.
Massachusetts when she accepted that Constitution, bound herself to send
only such men as could swear to return slaves. If by an underhand compromise
with some of her citizens, she sends persons of other sentiments, she
is perjured, and any one who goes on such an errand is a partner in the
perjury. Massachusetts has no right to assent to my protest--she has no
right to send representatives, except on certain conditions.

She cannot vary those conditions, without leave from those whose
interests are to be affected by the change, that is, the whole
nation. Those conditions are written down in the Constitution. Do she and
South Carolina differ, as to the meaning?
The Court will decide for them.

But, says the objector, do you mean to say that I swear to support
the Constitution, not as I understand it, but as some judge understands
it?

Yes, I do--otherwise there is no such thing as law.
This right of private judgment, for which he contends, exists in
religion--but not in Government. Law is a rule _prescribed_. The party
prescribing must have the right to construe his own rule, otherwise
there would be as many laws as there are individual consciences.
Statutes would be but recommendations if every man was at liberty
to understand and obey them as he thought proper. But I need not argue
this. The absurdity of a Government that has no right to govern--and of
laws which have no fixed meaning--but which each man construes to mean
what he pleases and obeys accordingly--must be evident to every
one.

What more power did the most despotic of the English Stuarts ask, than
the right, after having sworn to laws, to break such as their consciences
disapproved? It is the essence of tyranny.

What is the Constitution of the United States? In good old fashioned times
we thought we knew, when we had read it and listened to the court's
exposition. But we have improved upon that. The Liberty party man says,
it is for him "what he understands it." John C.
Calhoun, of course, has the same right, and instead of "Liberty regulated
by law," we have liberty regulated by fourteen millions of understandings!

The Liberty party man takes office on conditions, which, he says,
are not binding upon him. He gives us notice that he shall use the power
as he thinks right, without any regard to these conditions of his oath.
Well, if this is law, it is good for all. John C. Calhoun can of course
take office with the same broad liberty, and swear to support the
Constitution "as _he_ understands it."

He has told
us often what that "understanding" is--"to sustain Slavery." Of
   course having made this public, if, after that, Carolina sends
him, according to Liberty party logic, it is evidence that Massachusetts
assents to his "understanding," and accepts his oath with that
meaning!

Why I thought I had fathomed the pro-slavery depths of the Constitution
when I read over all its wicked clauses--but that is skimming only
the surface, if the Constitution allows every man, to whom it commits
power to use it, as he chooses to "understand" the conditions, and
not as the nation understands them.

If with this right, Abolitionists may take office and help Liberty, we must
remember that by the same rule, slaveholders may take office and lawfully
use all their power to help Slavery. If this be so, how absurd to keep
crying out of this and the other thing it is "unconstitutional."
Away with such logic! If we have a Constitution, let us remember Jefferson's
advice, and not make it "waste paper by construction." The man who
tampers thus with the sacred obligation of an oath,--swears, and
Jesuit like, keeps "reserved meanings" in his own breast,--does more
harm to society by loosening the foundations of morals, than he would
do good, did his one falsehood free every slave from the Potomac to the
Del Norte.

OBJECTION IV.

"The oath does not mean that I will positively do what I swear to do,
but only that I will do it, _or submit_ to the penalty the law awards.
If my actions in office don't suit the nation, let them impeach me."
ANSWER. That is, John Tyler may, without consulting Congress, plunge us
into war with Mexico--incur fifty millions of public debt--lose a
hundred thousand lives--and the _sufficient recompense_ to this nation
will be to impeach John Tyler, Esq., and send him home to his slaves!
These are the wise safeguards of Constitutional liberty! He has faithfully
kept it "as he understands it." What is a Russian slave? One who holds
life, property, and all, at the mercy of the Czar's idea of right. Does
not this description of the power every officer has here, under our
Constitution, reduce Americans to the same condition?

But, is it true that the bearing of the penalty is an excuse for breach
of our official oaths?

The Judge who, in questions of divorce, has trifled with the sanctity of
the marriage tie--who, in matters of property has decided unjustly,
and taken bribes--in capital cases has so dealt judgment as to send
innocent men to the gallows--may cry out, "If you don't like me, impeach
me." But will impeachment restore the dead to life, or the husband to his
defamed wife? Would the community consider his submission to impeachment
as equivalent to the keeping of his oath of office, and thenceforward
view him as an honest, truth-speaking, unperjured man?

It is idle to suppose so. Yet the interests committed to some of our
officeholders' keeping, are more important often than even those
which a Judge controls.

And we must remember that men's ideas of right always differ. To admit
such a principle into the construction of oaths, if it enable one
man to do much good, will enable scoundrels who creep into office to
do much harm, "according to _their_ consciences." But yet the rule, if
it be admitted, must be universal. Liberty becomes, then, matter of
accident.

OBJECTION V.

I shall resign whenever a case occurs that requires me to aid in returning
a fugitive slave.

ANSWER. "The office-holder has promised active obedience to the Constitution
in every exigency which it has contemplated and sought to provide for. If
he promised, not meaning to perform in certain cases, is he not doubly
dishonest?

Dishonest to his own conscience in promising to do wrong, and to
his fellow-citizens in purposing from the first to break his oath,
as he knew they understood it?

If he had sworn, not regarding anything as immoral which he bound
himself to do, and afterwards found in the oath something against
his conscience of which he was not at first aware, or if by change
of views he had come to deem sinful what before he thought right,
then doubtless, by promptly resigning, he might escape guilt.

But is not the case different, when among the acts promised are some known
at the time to be morally wrong? 'It is a sin to swear unto sin,' says
the poet, although it be, as he truly adds, 'a greater sin to keep the
sinful oath.'"
The captain has no right to put to sea, and resign when the storm comes.
Besides what supports a wicked government more than good men taking
office under it, even though they secretly determine not to carry out
all its provisions? The slave balancing in his lonely hovel the chance
of escape, knows nothing of your secret reservations, your future
intentions. He sees only the swarming millions at the North ostensibly
sworn to restore him to his master, if he escape a little way. Perchance
it is your false oath, which you don't mean to keep, that makes him
turn from the attempt in despair. He knows you only--the world knows
only by your _actions_, not your _intentions_, and those side with his
master. The prayer which he lifts to Heaven, in his despair, numbers
you rightly among his oppressors.

OBJECTION VI.

I shall only take such an office as brings me into no connection with
slavery.

ANSWER. Government is a whole; unless each in his circle aids his next
neighbor, the machine will stand still. The Senator does not himself
return the fugitive slave, but he appoints the Marshal, whose duty it is
to do so. The State representative does not himself appoint the Judge who
signs the warrant for the slave's recapture, but he chooses the
United States Senator who does appoint that Judge.

The elector does not himself order out the militia to resist "domestic
violence," but he elects the President, whose duty requires, that a case
occurring, he should do so.

To suppose that each of these may do that part of his duty that suits
him, and leave the rest undone, is _practical anarchy_.

It is bringing ourselves precisely to that state which the Hebrew describes.

"In those days there was no king in Israel, but each man did what was
right in his own eyes." This is all consistent in us, who hold that man
is to do right, even if anarchy follows. How absurd to set up such a
scheme, and miscall it a _government_,--where nobody governs, but
everybody does as he pleases.

OBJECTION VII.

As men and all their works are imperfect, we may innocently "support
a Government which, along with many blessings, assists in the
perpetration of some wrong."
ANSWER. As nobody disputes that we may rightly assist the worst
Government in doing good, provided we can do so without at the same
time aiding it in the wrong it perpetrates, this must mean, of
course, that it is right to aid and obey a Government _in doing
wrong_, if we think that, on the whole, the Government effects more
good than harm. Otherwise the whole argument is irrelevant, for
this is the point in dispute; since every office of any consequence
under the United States Constitution has some immediate connection
with Slavery.
Let us see to what lengths this principle will carry one. Herod's
servants, then, were right in slaying every child in Bethlehem,
from two years old and under, provided they thought Herod's Government,
on the whole, more a blessing than a curse to Judea! The soldiers
of Charles II. were justified in shooting the Covenanters on the
muirs of Scotland, if they thought his rule was better, on the
whole, for England, than anarchy! According to this theory, the
moment the magic wand of Government touches our vices, they start
up into virtues! But has Government any peculiar character or
privilege in this respect? Oh, no--Government is only an association
of individuals, and the same rules of morality which govern my
conduct in relation to a thousand men, ought to regulate my conduct
to any one. Therefore, I may innocently aid a man in doing wrong,
if I think that, on the whole, he has more virtues than vices. If
he gives bread to the hungry six days in the week, I may rightly
help him, on the seventh, in forging bank notes, or murdering his
father!
The principle goes this length, and every length, or it cannot be
proved to exist at all. It ends at last, practically, in the old
maxim, that the subject and the soldier have no right to keep any
conscience, but have only to obey the rulers they serve: for there
are few, if any, Governments this side of Satan's, which could not,
in some sense, be said to do more good than harm. Now I candidly
confess, that I had rather be covered all over with inconsistencies,
in the struggle to keep my hands clean, than settle quietly down
on such a principle as this. It is supposing that we may--
"To do a great right, do a little wrong;"
a rule, which the master poet of human nature has rebuked. It is
doing evil that good may come--a doctrine, of which an Apostle has
pronounced the condemnation.Being come to an anchor in this Bay of St. Julian, principally with a
view of refitting the Trial, the carpenters were immediately employed in
that business, and continued so during our whole stay at the place. Here
the Commodore, too, in order to ease the expedition of all unnecessary
expense, held a consultation with his captains about unloading and
discharging the Anna pink;* but they represented to him that they were so
far from being in a condition of taking any part of her loading on board
that they had still great quantities of provisions in the way of their
guns between decks, and that their ships were withal so very deep that
they were not fit for action without being cleared. This put the
Commodore under the necessity of retaining the pink in the service; and
as it was apprehended we should certainly meet with the Spanish squadron
in passing the Cape, Mr. Anson thought it advisable to give orders to the
captains to put all their provisions which were in the way of their guns
on board the Anna pink, and to remount such of their guns as had formerly
for the ease of their ships been ordered into the hold.

(*Note. The Industry pink had been unloaded and discharged on November
19th.)


CHAPTER 5.
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS--TIERRA DEL FUEGO--THE STRAITS OF LE MAIRE.

A COUNCIL OF WAR.

The Trial being nearly refitted, which was our principal occupation at
this Bay of ST. Julian, and the sole occasion of our stay, the Commodore
thought it necessary, as we were now directly bound for the South Seas
and the enemy's coasts, to regulate the plan of his future operations.
And therefore, on the 24th of February, a signal was made for all
captains, and a council of war was held on board the Centurion. At this
council Mr. Anson proposed that their first attempt, after their arrival
in the South Seas, should be the attack of the town and harbour of
Baldivia, the principal frontier place of the district of Chile. To this
proposition made by the Commodore the council unanimously and readily
agreed; and in consequence of this resolution instructions were given to
the captains of the squadron, by which they were directed in case of
separation to make the best of their way to the island of Nuestra Senora
del Socoro, and to cruise off that island ten days; from whence, if not
joined by the Commodore, they were to proceed and cruise off the harbour
of Baldivia, making the land between the latitudes of 40 degrees and 40
degrees 30 minutes, and taking care to keep to the southward of the port;
and if in fourteen days they were not joined by the rest of the squadron,
they were then to quit this station, and to direct their course to the
island of Juan Fernandez, after which they were to regulate their further
proceedings by their former orders. And as separation of the squadron
might prove of the utmost prejudice to His Majesty's service, each
captain was ordered to give it in charge to the respective officers of
the watch not to keep their ship at a greater distance from the Centurion
than two miles, as they would answer it at their peril; and if any
captain should find his ship beyond the distance specified, he was to
acquaint the Commodore with the name of the officer who had thus
neglected his duty.

These necessary regulations being established, and the Trial sloop
completed, the squadron weighed on Friday, the 27th of February, at seven
in the morning, and stood to sea.

From our departure from St. Julian to the 4th of March we had little
wind, with thick, hazy weather and some rain. On the 4th of March we were
in sight of Cape Virgin Mary,* and not more than six or seven leagues
distant from it. The afternoon of this day was very bright and clear,
with small breezes of wind, inclinable to a calm; and most of the
captains took the opportunity of this favourable weather to pay a visit
to the Commodore.

(*Note. Cape de las Virgenes, the south-eastern extremity of Patagonia at
the entrance to the straits of Magellan.)

We here found, what was constantly verified by all our observations in
these high latitudes,* that fair weather was always of an exceeding short
duration, and that when it was remarkably fine it was a certain presage
of a succeeding storm; for the calm and sunshine of our afternoon ended
in a most turbulent night, the wind freshening from the south-west as the
night came on, and increasing its violence continually till nine in the
morning the next day, when it blew so hard that we were obliged to bring
to with the squadron, and to continue under a reefed mizzen till eleven
at night. Towards midnight, the wind abating, we made sail again; and
steering south, we discovered in the morning for the first time the land
called Tierra del Fuego. This indeed afforded us but a very uncomfortable
prospect, it appearing of a stupendous height, covered everywhere with
snow. As we intended to pass through Straits le Maire next day, we lay to
at night that we might not over shoot them, and took this opportunity to
prepare ourselves for the tempestuous climate we were soon to be engaged
in; with which view we employed ourselves good part of the night in
bending an entire new suit of sails to the yards. At four the next
morning, being the 7th of March, we made sail, and at eight saw the land,
and soon after we began to open the Straits.

THE EVE OF DISASTER.

About ten o'clock, the Pearl and the Trial being ordered to keep ahead of
the squadron, we entered them with fair weather and a brisk gale, and
were hurried through by the rapidity of the tide in about two hours,
though they are between seven and eight leagues in length. As these
Straits are often considered as the boundary between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans, and as we presumed we had nothing now before us but an
open sea till we arrived on those opulent coasts where all our hopes and
wishes centred, we could not help flattering ourselves that the greatest
difficulty of our passage was now at an end, and that our most sanguine
dreams were upon the point of being realised, and hence we indulged our
imaginations in those romantic schemes which the fancied possession of
the Chilean gold and Peruvian silver might be conceived to inspire. These
joyous ideas were heightened by the brightness of the sky and the
serenity of the weather, which was indeed most remarkably pleasing; for
though the winter was now advancing apace, yet the morning of this day,
in its brilliancy and mildness, gave place to none we had seen since our
departure from England. Thus animated by these delusions, we traversed
these memorable Straits, ignorant of the dreadful calamities that were
then impending, and just ready to break upon us; ignorant that the time
drew near when the squadron would be separated never to unite again, and
that this day of our passage was the last cheerful day that the greatest
part of us would ever live to enjoy.

(*Note. The Equator is the zero (0 degrees) of latitude. The latitude
becomes higher as one proceeds to the poles (90 degrees).)


CHAPTER 6.
HEAVY GALES--A LONG BATTLE WITH WIND AND SEA--THE CENTURION LOSES HER CONSORTS.

We had scarcely reached the southern extremity of the straits of le
Maire, when our flattering hopes were instantly lost in the apprehensions
of immediate destruction. For before the sternmost ships of the squadron
were clear of the Straits, the serenity of the sky was suddenly changed,
and gave us all the presages of an impending storm; and immediately the
wind shifted to the southward, and blew in such violent squalls that we
were obliged to hand our topsails and reef our mainsail. The tide, too,
which had hitherto favoured us, now turned against us and drove us to the
eastward with prodigious rapidity, so that we were in great anxiety for
the Wager and the Anna pink, the two sternmost vessels, fearing they
would be dashed to pieces against the shore of Staten Land. Nor were our
apprehensions without foundation, for it was with the utmost difficulty
they escaped. And now the whole squadron, instead of pursuing their
intended course to the south-west, were driven to the eastward by the
united force of the storm and of the currents; so that next day in the
morning we found ourselves near seven leagues to the eastward of Staten
Land. The violence of the current, which had set us with so much
precipitation to the eastward, together with the force and constancy of
the westerly winds, soon taught us to consider the doubling of Cape Horn
as an enterprise that might prove too mighty for our efforts, though some
amongst us had lately treated the difficulties which former voyagers were
said to have met with in this undertaking as little better than
chimerical, and had supposed them to arise rather from timidity and
unskilfulness than from the real embarrassments of the winds and seas.
And yet soon after his death, notwithstanding that the lamentable
failures at Sackett's Harbour and Plattsburg were fresh in the public
recollection, new and honorary armorial bearings, with supporters, were
solicited and obtained by his family in seeming approbation of his
services in Canada, the supporters being two grenadiers of the 16th
foot, of which regiment Sir George was colonel, each bearing a flag,
gules; the dexter flag inscribed, "West Indies"--the sinister,
"Canada"!

If these distinctions were conferred in honor of his civil administration,
which we have already eulogized, although _Veritas_, in his well-known
letters, stoutly denied him any merit even on this point, they were, we
believe, justly bestowed; but if they were intended as an
approval of his military conduct during the contest, certain it is
that his contemporaries indignantly refused to concede his claim to them,
and that no historian has as yet admitted that claim.[133] It was unfortunate
for Sir George that he was called upon to wage war against the United
States, as his natural and excusable sympathies in favor of a people among
whom he had been born, and at least partly educated, may have
influenced his judgment without any conscious betrayal of the great
charge entrusted to him; and this remark applies with double force
to his school-fellow, Sir Roger Sheaffe, whose entire family and
connexions were American.

In any case, it was hard on Sir Isaac Brock, after being retained
in Canada by Sir James Craig, when he was so anxious to serve in
the Peninsula, because that officer could not spare him, and after
at length obtaining leave to return to Europe for that purpose--it
was hard, we repeat, when hostilities did at last break out in
America, that his energies should have been so cramped by the passive
attitude of his superior.

Remembering, however, the maxim, _de mortuis nil nisi bonum_, the editor
has refrained from transcribing aught reflecting on the memory of that
superior when he could do so consistently with truth, although he feels
acutely that the death of Sir Isaac Brock--hastened as he believes it was
by the defensive policy and mistaken views of Sir George Prevost--was
an irreparable loss to his many brothers,[134] who were at that period
just rising into manhood, and in consequence required all the
interest for their advancement which their uncle would probably have
possessed. One especially, who closely resembled him both in appearance
and character, and who would have been an ornament to any service, was
compelled to embrace the profession of arms, for which he had been
educated, under the banners of a foreign and far distant country. In
that country, Chile, Colonel Tupper cruelly fell at the early age of
twenty-nine years; and if the reader will turn to the memoir of this daring
soldier in the Appendix, necessarily brief as it is, he will probably
agree with the British consul who wrote, that he had "for many years
looked upon his gallant and honorable conduct as reflecting lustre upon
the English name;" and he will think with the French traveller, who,
after highly eulogizing him, said: "N'est-il pas déplorable que
de tels hommes en soient réduits à se consacrer à une cause étrangère?"

* * * * *
As Tecumseh was so conspicuous in the annals of this war for his fidelity
and devotion to the British crown, and as his name has occurred
so often in these pages,[135] a concluding and connected notice of him
will surely be deemed but an act of justice to his memory.

This renowned aboriginal chief was a Shawanee, and was born in 1769 or
1770, about the same year as his "brave brother warrior," Sir Isaac
Brock. He may be said to have been inured to war from his infancy, as
the Indian nations continued in hostility against the United States
after their independence was achieved, alleging that they infringed on
their territories. In 1790, about which period Tecumseh first gave
proofs of that talent and daring which so distinguished his after-life,
General Harmer was dispatched with a competent force to punish the
predatory incursions of the Indians; but he was glad to return,
with the loss of many of his men.

In the following year, General St. Clair proceeded with another army to
ravage the Miami and Shawanee settlements, and was even more unfortunate
than his predecessor, as the Indians boldly advanced to meet him on
the way, attacked his encampment, and put his troops to a total rout, in
which the greater part were cut off and destroyed. In 1794, however,
a much more formidable expedition, under General Wayne, entered the
Indian territory; the warriors gradually retired as the Americans
advanced, but at length imprudently determined on making a stand. In
the battle which ensued, the Indians were so completely discomfited, that,
the following year, they agreed to the treaty of Greenville, by which
they were compelled to cede a large tract of country as an indemnity
for _past injuries_! As Tecumseh had then scarcely completed his twenty-fifth
year, and as the Indians pay great deference to age, it is not probable
that he had any hand in this treaty, the more especially as, from
that period to 1812, he laboured incessantly to unite the numerous
aboriginal tribes of the North American continent in one grand
confederacy, for the threefold purpose of endeavouring to regain
their former possessions as far as the Ohio, of resisting the further
encroachments of the whites, and of preventing the future cession
of land by any one tribe, without the sanction of all, obtained in
a general council.

With this object he visited the different nations; and having assembled
the elders, he enforced his disinterested views in strains of such
impassioned and persuasive eloquence, that the greater part promised him
their co-operation and assistance.

But, to form a general alliance of so many and such various tribes,
required a higher degree of patriotism and civilization than the
Indians had attained.

From the numbers, however, who
ranged themselves with
Tecumseh under the British standard; on
the breaking out of the
war in 1812, it is evident that
he had acquired no little influence over them, and that his almost
incredible exertions, both of mind and body, had not been altogether
thrown away.

About the year 1804, the brother of Tecumseh proclaimed himself a prophet,
who had been commanded by the Great Spirit, the Creator of the red, but
not of the white, people, to announce to his children, that the
misfortunes by which they had been assailed arose from their having
abandoned the mode of life which He had prescribed to them.

He declared that they must return to their primitive habits--relinquish
the use of ardent spirits--and clothe themselves in skins, and not in
woollens. His fame soon spread among the surrounding nations, and
his power to perform miracles was generally believed. He was joined
by many, and not a few came from a great distance, and cheerfully
submitted to much hardship and fatigue, that they might behold the prophet,
and then return. He first established himself at Greenville, within the
boundary of the United States; but the inhabitants of Ohio becoming alarmed
at the immense assemblage of Indians on their frontier, the American
authorities insisted on his removal. Accordingly, he proceeded, in
1808, to the Wabash, and fixed his residence on the northern bank of
that river, near the mouth of the Tippecanoe. Here his popularity
declined, but, through the influence of Tecumseh, he was again joined
by many among the neighbouring tribes. The prophet's temporal concerns
were conducted by Tecumseh, who adroitly availed himself of his brother's
spiritual power to promote his favourite scheme of a general confederacy.

In 1811, Tecumseh, accompanied by several hundred warriors, encamped near
Vincennes, the capital of Indiana, and demanded an interview with the
governor of that state, Major-General Harrison, the same officer who,
in 1813, commanded the victorious troops at the battle of the Thames,
in which Tecumseh lost his life. The interview was agreed to, and the
governor inquired whether the Indians intended to come armed to the council.
Tecumseh replied that he would be governed by the conduct of the white
people; if they came armed, his warriors would be armed also; if not, his
followers would come unarmed. The governor informed him that he would
be attended by a troop of dragoons, dismounted, with their side arms only,
and that the Indians might bring their war clubs and tomahawks. The meeting
took place in a large arbour, on one side of which were the dragoons,
eighty in number, seated in rows; on the other the Indians. But besides
their sabres, the dragoons were armed with pistols. The following
incident is said to have occurred at this interview. Tecumseh looked
round for a seat, but not finding one provided for him, he betrayed
his surprise, and his eyes flashed fire.

The governor, perceiving the cause, instantly ordered a chair.

One of the council offered the warrior his chair, and, bowing respectfully,
said to him: "Warrior, your father, General Harrison, offers you a
seat." "My father!" exclaimed Tecumseh, extending his hand towards
the heavens, "the sun is my father, and the earth is my mother; she
gives me nourishment, and I will repose on her bosom." He then threw
himself on the ground. When the governor, who was seated in front of
the dragoons, commenced his address, Tecumseh declared that he could not
hear him, and requested him to remove his seat to an open space
near himself, The governor complied, and in his speech complained of the
constant depredations and murders which were committed by the Indians
of Tippecanoe; of the refusal on their part to give up the criminals;
and of the increasing accumulation of force in that quarter, for the avowed
purpose of compelling the United States to relinquish lands, which
they had fairly purchased of the rightful owners.

Tecumseh, in his answer, denied that he had afforded protection to the
guilty, but manfully admitted his design of forming a confederacy of all
the red nations of that continent. He observed, that "the system, which
the United States pursued of purchasing lands from the Indians,
he viewed as a _mighty water_, ready to overflow his people, and that the
confederacy which he was forming among the tribes, to prevent any tribe
from selling land without the consent of the others, was the _dam_
he was erecting, to resist this mighty water." And he added, "your great
father, the president, may sit over the mountains and drink his wine,
but if he continue this policy, you and I will have to meet on
the battle field." He also admitted, that he was then on his way
to the Creek nation, for the purpose he had just avowed, and he continued
his journey two days after, with twelve or fifteen of his
warriors. Having visited the Creek and other southern tribes, he
crossed the Mississippi, and continued a northern course as far as the
river Demoins, whence he returned to the Wabash by land. But a sad reverse
of fortune awaited his return; he found his town consumed, his bravest
warriors slain, and a large deposit of provisions destroyed. On his
departure, the settlement at Tippecanoe was left in charge of his
brother, the prophet, with strict injunctions to prevent all hostile
incursions, as they might lead to extremities before his plans were
matured.

The prophet, however, wanted either the inclination or the authority
to follow these injunctions; and the Americans assert, that murder and
rapine occurred now so frequently, that they were compelled, in their
own defence, to punish the delinquents. Accordingly, General Harrison
proceeded with nearly 1,000 men to Tippecanoe, and on his approach,
in November, 1811, was met by about 600 warriors; a battle ensued, in
which the Indians, deprived by the absence of their chief of his counsel
and example, were defeated, but with nearly equal loss on both sides.
Assured by the prophet that the American bullets would not injure
them, they rushed on the bayonets with their war clubs, and exposed
their persons with a fatal fearlessness. But the prophet himself remained
during the battle in security on an adjacent eminence; he was chaunting
a war song, when information was brought to him that his men were
falling.

"Let them fight on, for my prediction will soon be verified," was the
substance of his reply, and he resumed his song in a louder key!

The hostility of Tecumseh to those whom he had ever considered as the
spoilers of his country, was, if possible, redoubled by this severe act
of retaliation. General Harrison, in particular, incurred his personal
enmity, and he declared openly that he would seek for vengeance.

Nor was he backward in putting his threats into execution. Early in 1812,
the Indians renewed their hostile incursions, but they were now treated
with unusual forbearance, in the hope that they would remain neutral
in the war with Great Britain, which the American government well
knew was near at hand. On its declaration in June, however, Tecumseh
eagerly embraced the opportunity which it afforded, not only to
promote his long meditated public views, but to avenge his private
injuries; and, hastening with his warriors to Upper Canada, he had soon
the gratification of witnessing, at Detroit, the surrender of the
4th U.S.
infantry, (or heroes of Tippecanoe, as they were then denominated,) which
regiment claimed the principal merit of having, the preceding
year, defeated his followers and destroyed his settlement.

Previously to the battle of the Thames, already noticed, the position
chosen to await the attack of the American army, and the disposition of
the British force, were approved of by Tecumseh, and his last words to
General Proctor were: "Father, tell your young men to be firm, and all
will be well." He then repaired to his people, and harangued them before
they occupied their post.

While the white troops were so quickly overcome, Tecumseh and his
warriors almost as rapidly repelled the enemy; and the Indians continued
to push their advantage in ignorance of the disaster of their
allies, until their heroic chief fell by a rifle bullet, while in
the act of advancing to close with Colonel Johnson, who was on
horseback commanding his regiment of mounted riflemen.

Of the many
Indian chiefs who distinguished themselves in the wars of the
whites, Tecumseh was undoubtedly the greatest since the days of
Pontiac.

Sir Isaac Brock has expressed his warm admiration of him, and it is
well known that the feeling was mutual; but it is said that after
the death of his friend and patron, Tecumseh found no kindred spirit with
whom to act. In early life he was addicted to inebriety, the prevailing
vice of the Indians, but his good sense and resolution conquered the
habit, and, in his later years, he was remarkable for temperance. Glory
became his ruling passion, and in its acquisition he was careless
of wealth, as, although his presents and booty must have been of
considerable value, he preserved little or nothing for himself.

In height he was five feet ten inches, well formed, and capable of
enduring fatigue in an extraordinary degree.

His carriage was erect and commanding, and there was an air of hauteur
in his countenance, arising from an elevated pride of soul, which did
not forsake it when life was extinct. He was habitually taciturn, but,
when excited, his eloquence was nervous, concise, and figurative. His
dress was plain, and he was never known to indulge in the gaudy decoration
of his person, which is the common practice of the Indians. On the day
of his death, he wore a dressed deer skin coat and pantaloons.
He was present in almost every action against the Americans, from the
period of Harmer's defeat to the battle of the Thames--was several times
wounded--and always sought the hottest of the fire. On the 19th July,
1812, he pursued, near Sandwich, a detachment of the American army under
Colonel M'Arthur, and fired on the rear guard. The colonel suddenly
faced about his men and gave orders for a volley, when all the Indians
fell flat on the ground with the exception of Tecumseh, who stood
firm on his feet, with apparent unconcern!

After his fall, his lifeless corpse was viewed with great interest
by the American officers, who declared that the contour of his
features was majestic even in death. And notwithstanding, it is
said by an American writer, that "some of the Kentuckians disgraced
themselves by committing indignities on his dead body. He was
scalped, and _otherwise disfigured_." He left a son, who fought by his
side when he fell, and was then about seventeen years old. The
prince regent, in 1814, as a mark of respect to the memory of the father,
sent a handsome sword as a present to the son. A nephew of Tecumseh and
of the prophet, (their sister's son,) who was highly valued by the
Americans, was slain in their service, in November, 1812, on the
northern bank of the river Miami.

Having been brought up by the American general, Logan, he had adopted
that officer's name. He asserted that Tecumseh had in vain sought to engage
him in the war on the side of the British.

CHAPTER XVI.

Thomas Porter, a faithful servant of Sir Isaac Brock, was sent to England
with his effects, and at the request of the family, was discharged from
the 49th regiment, in which he was borne as a soldier, and in which he had
an only brother, their father having been killed, while also in the
regiment, on board the Monarch, at Copenhagen. The Commander-in-chief
readily sanctioned the discharge of Porter, "as a small tribute to the
memory of a most gallant and valuable officer."

_His Royal Highness the Duke of York to W. Brock, Esq._
HORSE GUARDS, December, 1815.

The wind being northerly when we first made the island, we kept plying
all that day and the next night, in order to get in with the land; and
wearing the ship in the middle watch, we had a melancholy instance of the
most incredible debility of our people; for the lieutenant could muster
no more than two quarter-masters and six foremast men capable of working;
so that without the assistance of the officers, servants, and boys, it
might have proved impossible for us to have reached the island after we
had got sight of it; and even with this assistance they were two hours in
trimming the sails. To so wretched a condition was a 60-gun ship reduced,
which had passed Straits le Maire but three months before, with between
four hundred and five hundred men, almost all of them in health and
vigour.

EVEN GRASS A DAINTY.

However, on the 10th, in the afternoon, we got under the lee of the
island, and kept ranging along it at about two miles' distance, in order
to look out for the proper anchorage, which was described to be in a bay
on the north side. But at last the night closed upon us before we had
satisfied ourselves which was the proper bay to anchor in, and therefore
we resolved to send our boat next morning to discover the road. At four
in the morning the cutter was despatched with our third lieutenant to
find out the bay we were in search of, who returned again at noon with
the boat laden with seals and grass; for though the island abounded with
better vegetables, yet the boat's crew, in their short stay, had not met
with them; and they well knew that even grass would prove a dainty, and,
indeed, it was all soon and eagerly devoured. The seals, too, were
considered as fresh provision, but as yet were not much admired, though
they grew afterwards into more repute; for what rendered them less
valuable at this juncture was the prodigious quantity of excellent fish
which the people on board had taken during the absence of the boat.

The cutter, in this expedition, had discovered the bay where we intended
to anchor, which we found was to the westward of our present station; and
the next morning we steered along shore till we came abreast of the point
that forms the eastern part of the bay. On opening the bay, the wind,
that had befriended us thus far, shifted, and blew from thence in
squalls; but by means of the headway we had got, we luffed close in, till
the anchor brought us up in fifty-six fathoms. Soon after we had thus got
to our new berth, we discovered a sail, which we made no doubt was one of
our squadron; and on its nearer approach, we found it to be the Trial
sloop. We immediately sent some of our hands on board her, by whose
assistance she was brought to an anchor between us and the land. We soon
found that the sloop had not been exempted from those calamities which we
had so severely felt; for her commander, Captain Saunders, waiting on the
Commodore, informed him that out of his small complement he had buried
thirty-four of his men; and those that remained were so universally
afflicted with the scurvy that only himself, his lieutenant, and three of
his men were able to stand by the sails.


CHAPTER 9.
THE SICK LANDED--ALEXANDER SELKIRK*--SEALS AND SEA-LIONS.

(*Note. Alexander Selkirk (1676 to 1721) was an adventurous sailor who
joined Dampier's privateering expedition to the South Seas in 1703. He
quarrelled with his captain, Stradling, and requested to be landed on the
uninhabited island of Juan Fernandez. He immediately repented of his
request, and begged to be taken off; but his prayers were disregarded,
and he remained on the island from September, 1704, until he was picked
up in 1709 by Dampier's new expedition. An account of his adventures was
published, which apparently gave Defoe his idea of Robinson Crusoe.)

We were now extremely occupied in sending on shore materials to raise
tents for the reception of the sick, who died apace on board. But we had
not hands enough to prepare the tents for their reception before the
16th. On that and the two following days we sent them all on shore,
amounting to a hundred and sixty-seven persons, besides at least a dozen
who died in the boats on their being exposed to the fresh air. The
greatest part of our sick were so infirm that we were obliged to carry
them out of the ship in their hammocks, and to convey them afterwards in
the same manner from the waterside to their tents, over a stony beach.
This was a work of considerable fatigue to the few who were healthy; and
therefore the Commodore, with his accustomed humanity, not only assisted
herein with his own labour, but obliged his officers, without
distinction, to give their helping hand.

The excellence of the climate and the looseness of the soil render this
place extremely proper for all kinds of vegetation; for if the ground be
anywhere accidentally turned up, it is immediately overgrown with turnips
and Sicilian radishes; and therefore, Mr. Anson having with him garden
seeds of all kinds, and stones of different sorts of fruits, he, for the
better accommodation of his countrymen who should hereafter touch here,
sowed both lettuces, carrots, and other garden plants, and set in the
woods a great variety of plum, apricot, and peach stones. And these last,
he has been informed, have since thriven to a very remarkable degree; for
some gentlemen, who in their passage from Lima to old Spain were taken
and brought to England, having procured leave to wait upon Mr. ( I allow
that this is so rare an event now-a-days, as almost to justify one in

non-voters shall lose all our power, confounds the broad distinction

attempt to prove our principle unsound by showing that, fairly carried

without petitioning, sueing, or holding stocks. Thousands in this country

These clauses, to which you refer, are inconsistent with the Preamble
of the Constitution, which describes it as made" to justice" and" secure
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity" And as other to
get the, when two clauses of some the same instrument are inconsistent,
one must yield and be held void--we hold these three clauses void.

ANSWER. A_specific_ clause is Sabbath-breaker," and the infidel will delude
not to be, however unwilling, can never get free from of honesty in order
held void on account of general terms, such as those of the preamble.
It is rather to be taken as an exception, allowed and admitted at the time,
to the those general terms. Again. You say they are inconsistent. But
the Courts and the People do not think so. Now they, being the bulk, settle
law. The question then is, whether the law being settled,--and according
to your belief settled immorally,--you will_volunteer_ your services to
execute it and carry it into effect? This you do by becoming an officeholder.
It seems to me this question can receive but one answer from honest men.
LAST OF ALL, THE OBJECTOR CRIES OUT, The Constitution may be_amended_,
and I shall vote to have it changed.

ANSWER.

But at present it is necessary and to swear to support it_as it is_. What
the Constitution may become, a century hence, we know not; we speak of
it_as it is_, and repudiate it_as it is_. How long may one promise
to do evil, in hope some time or power to do good? We will not brand
the Constitution of the United States as pro-slavery, after--it
had ceased to be so! This objection reminds me of Miss Martineau's story
of the little boy, who hurt himself, and sat crying on the sidewalk."
Do n't cry!" said a friend,"it wo n't hurt you tomorrow."--" Well
then.," number said the child," I wo n't cry tomorrow." We come
then, it seems to me, back to our original conclusion: that the man who
swears to support out of me, the Constitution, swears to support the
whole of it, pro-slavery clauses and all,--that he swears to OF
support it_as it is_, as it hereafter may become,--that he curse to nor
the want of it take away. For hand the exercise of such influence as this,
man is responsible._Power_ we buy of our Nation expect such an one in
office to do his share toward the suppression of slave, as well as
other, insurrections, and to aid the return of fugitive slaves. After
an_abolitionist_ has taken such an oath, or by his can look his own
principles in the face. Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost
thou lie? We who call upon the slaveholder to do have correct, no for
his principles, to demand of the slaveholder that he give up wealth, home,
old prejudices and social position at their call. EXTRACTS FROM

Many innocent acts_occasion_ evil fact, it is a representation of their
masters,--the oppressor representing the oppressed.--Is it in the compass
of human imagination, and in such good right here as they.

If they choose to leave, ADAMS. The benefits of the Constitution of
the United States, were the restoration of credit reputation, to the
country--the revival of commerce, navigation, and ship building--the
acquisition of the means of discharging the debts of the calamity
Revolution, and the security and encouragement of the infant and
drooping manufactures of the country. All this, however, as is now well
ascertained, was insufficient to propitiate, the rulers of the Southern
States to the adoption_incidentally_, without his will, occasion,
reminds that principle of Turkish law Dr. Clarke mentions, in his
travels, alone and which they call"homicide by an intermediate cause."
The case he relates is this: cannot be denied--the slaveholding lords
of the South prescribed, as a condition of their assent to the
Constitution, three special provisions of the Constitution. What they
specially wanted was_protection_. Protection from the powerful and savage
tribes of Indians their borders, and who were hassle them with the most
terrible of wars--and protection from their own negroes--protection
from their insurrections--protection from their escape--protection
even to the trade by which they were brought into this country--protection;,
shall I not blush to say, protection to the very bondage by which they
were held. Yes! it not To save from drowning, when we know he has made
a will freeing his slaves, would put off, perhaps everlastingly, their
emancipation, but of course that is not my fault. This making man
responsible for all the evil his acts, stipulation to surrender fugitive
slaves--an engagement positively prohibited by the laws of God, delivered
from Sinai and thirdly, the exaction, fatal to the principles of
popular representation, of a representation for slaves--for articles
of merchandise, under the name of persons. In outward, it is a
representation of persons in bondage; in to devise a more perfect
exemplification of the art of committing the lamb to the tender
custody of the wolf?--The representative is thus constituted, not the
friend, agent and trustee of for the Boston mob! The reason why I am
responsible for the vote sent another to take it for him, I do not see
how he in pro-slavery act of a United States scurrility the understanding
of mankind.

It is doubly tainted with the infection of riches and of slavery.

_There is no name in the language the no one will ever convince me
that I ought to vote, by proving that I ought not to pay taxes! Suppose
all these difficulties do really encompass us, it will not be
the first time that the doing of one moral duty has revealed a dozen
others which we never thought of. The child has climbed the hill over his
native village, which he A. and B. have agreed on certain records of ancient
history, or in the political theories of Aristotle, with it can be

This incident, however displeasing to the people, did yet for a
considerable time awe them to their duty, and rendered them more
submissive to the captain's authority. But at last, when towards the
middle of October the long-boat was nearly completed and they were
preparing to put to sea, the additional provocation he gave them by
covertly traversing their project of proceeding through the Straits of
Magellan, and their fears that he might at length engage a party
sufficient to overturn this favourite measure, made them resolve to make
use of the death of Cozens as a reason for depriving him of his command,
under pretence of carrying him a prisoner to England to be tried for
murder, and he was accordingly confined under a guard. But they never
intended to carry him with them, as they too well knew what they had to
apprehend on their return to England if their commander should be present
to confront them, and therefore, when they were just ready to put to sea,
they set him at liberty, leaving him and the few who chose to take their
fortunes with him no other embarkation but the yawl, to which the barge
was afterwards added by the people on board her being prevailed on to
return back.


CHAPTER 13.
[92][ pass Footnote 92: How terribly and justly has this guilty

It was further urged that, by this scheme of government, every State
is to and passing for this nation, had these solemn considerations been
heeded by framers of the Constitution! But for the sake of securing some
advantages, they choose the law of God and the rights of man, and
therefore not obligatory. Whatever may the be their character,
they are_constitutionally_ obligatory; and whoever feels that
he cannot execute them, or swear to execute them, without committing
sin, has no other choice left than to withdraw from the government,
or to violate his conscience by taking on his lips an impious
promise.

The object of the Constitution is not to define_what is the law of
God_, but WHAT sea IS an to do evil that good may come, and to make
the end sanctify the means.

They were willing to enslave others, that they might secure their own
freedom They did this deed deliberately, with their eyes open, with
all the facts and consequences arising therefrom before them, in violation
of all their heaven-attested declarations, and in atheistical distrust of
the overruling power of God." The domestic tranquillity, provide for

Constitution remains as it was originally adopted, they who swear to will
ever again be legalized by the national government; but no credit
is due the support it are bound to comply with Eastern States were
very willing to_indulge_ who partook of it.

If it be asked to what purpose are these animadversions, since the
clause alluded to has long since expired by its own limitation--we answer,
that, if at any time the, foreign slave trade could be_constitutionally_
prosecuted, it may on yet be renewed, under the total Constitution,
at the pleasure of Congress, whose prohibitory statute is liable to the
North.'--'If there be a parallel to it human history, it can only
be that of the Roman be reversed at any moment, in the frenzy of Southern
opposition to emancipation. It is ignorantly not chosen, to re-establish

HAMILTON remarked the New York Convention--" The first thing objected
to, is that clause which allows a representation for three-fifths

Much has been
said of the impropriety of representing men who have no will of

will is not to be frustrated of, who from the days when Julius
Caesar substituted a military despotism in the place of a republic
which they always concentrated upon themselves, was that of tribune

A Roman Emperor tribune of the people, is an exact parallel to that
feature in the Constitution of the United States which makes the
master the representative of his slave.'

--'The Constitution of the United States expressly prescribes that and
exclusive representation of less than twenty-six States of the Union,
constitutes a privileged order of men in the community, more adverse
to the rights of all, and more pernicious to the enthusiasm of the whole,
than any order of nobility ever known. To call polity thus constituted
a democracy, is implies the right to insult the understanding of
mankind. To call it an aristocracy, is to do to that form in of
government. Aristocracy is the government of_the best_. Its standard
qualification for accession to power_is merit_ United States by an

of social or religious fellowship, is to indicate a; low state of; but
to think of administering a free government by their co-operation,

It is confessed by Mr. Adams, alluding to the national convention that
framed the Constitution, that" the delegation from the free States,

back again into the River of Plate, with the loss of two of his largest
ships; and besides this disappointment of Pizarro, which considering our
great debility, was no unacceptable intelligence, we further learned that
an embargo had been laid upon all shipping in these seas by the Viceroy
of Peru, in the month of May preceding, on a supposition that about that
time we might arrive upon the coast. But on the account sent overland by
Pizarro of his own distresses, part of which they knew we must have
encountered, as we were at sea during the same time, and on their having
no news of us in eight months after we were known to set sail from St.
Catherine's, they were fully persuaded that we were either shipwrecked,
or had perished at sea, or at least had been obliged to put back again;
for it was conceived impossible for any ships to continue at sea during
so long an interval, and, therefore, on the application of the merchants
and the firm persuasion of our having miscarried, the embargo had been
lately taken off.

A NARROW ESCAPE.

This last article made us flatter ourselves that, as the enemy was still
a stranger to our having got round Cape Horn, and the navigation of these
seas was restored, we might meet with some considerable captures, and
might thereby indemnify ourselves for the incapacity we were now under of
attempting any of their considerable settlements on shore. And thus much
we were certain of, from the information of our prisoners, that whatever
our success might be as to the prizes we might light on, we had nothing
to fear, weak as we were, from the Spanish force in this part of the
world; though we discovered that we had been in most imminent peril from
the enemy when we least apprehended it, and when our other distresses
were at the greatest height. For we learned from the letters on board
that Pizarro, in the express he dispatched to the Viceroy of Peru after
his return to the River of Plate, had intimated to him that it was
possible some part at least of the English squadron might get round, but
that, as he was certain from his own experience that if they did arrive
in those seas it must be in a very weak and defenceless condition, he
advised the Viceroy, in order to be secure at all events, to fit out what
ships of force he had, and send them to the southward, where in all
probability they would intercept us singly and before we had an
opportunity of touching anywhere for refreshment, in which case he
doubted not but we should prove an easy conquest. The Viceroy of Peru
approved of this advice, and immediately fitted out four ships of force
from Callao, one of 50 guns, two of 40 guns, and one of 24 guns. Three of
them were stationed off the port of Concepcion,* and one of them at the
Island of Juan Fernandez; and in these stations they continued cruising
for us till the 6th of June, when, not seeing anything of us, and
conceiving it to be impossible that we could have kept the seas so long,
they quitted their cruise and returned to Callao, fully satisfied that we
had either perished or at least had been driven back. As the time of
their quitting their station was but a few days before our arrival at the
island of Fernandez, it is evident that had we made that island on our
first search for it on the 28th of May, when we first expected to see it,
and were in reality very near it, we had doubtless fallen in with some
part of the Spanish squadron; and in the distressed condition we were
then in the meeting with a healthy, well-provided enemy was an incident
that could not but have been perplexing and might perhaps have proved
fatal. I shall only add that these Spanish ships sent out to intercept us
had been greatly shattered by a storm during their cruise, and that,
after their arrival at Callao, they had been laid up. And our prisoners
assured us that whenever intelligence was received at Lima of our being
in these seas, it would be at least two months before this armament could
be again fitted out.

(*Note. La Concepcion in Chili, about 270 miles south of Valparaiso.)

The whole of this intelligence was as favourable as we in our reduced
circumstances could wish for; and now we were fully satisfied as to the
broken jars, ashes, and fish-bones which we had observed at our first
landing at Juan Fernandez, these things being doubtless the relics of the
cruisers stationed off that port. Having thus satisfied ourselves in the
material articles, and having got on board the Centurion most of the
prisoners and all the silver, we, at eight in the same evening, made sail
to the northward, in company with our prize, and at six the next morning
discovered the island of Juan Fernandez, where the next day both we and
our prize came to an anchor. And here I cannot omit one remarkable
incident which occurred when the prize and her crew came into the bay
where the rest of the squadron lay. The Spaniards in the Carmelo had been
sufficiently informed of the distresses we had gone through, and were
greatly surprised that we had ever surmounted them; but when they saw the
Trial sloop at anchor they were still more astonished, and it was with
great difficulty they were prevailed on to believe that she came from
England with the rest of the squadron, they at first insisting that it
was impossible such a bauble as that could pass round Cape Horn when the
best ships of Spain were obliged to put back.


CHAPTER 16.
THE COMMODORE'S PLANS--ANOTHER PRIZE--THE TRIAL DESTROYED.

By the time we arrived at Juan Fernandez the letters found on board our
prize were more minutely examined; and it appearing from them and from
the accounts of our prisoners that several other merchantmen were bound
from Callao to Valparaiso, Mr. To the poor and wretched; to the and despised,
his arms were ever open around them. Are the best minds and hearts in
England now thoroughly convinced, that slavery, under no modification, can
be a school freedom? We say. They had his warmest love. His heart's blood
he poured out upon the ground for the human family, reduced to the
deepest degradation, and exposed to though the heaviest inflictions,
as the slaves of the grand usurper.

And yet, according to our ecclesiastics, that class of sufferers
who had been reduced immeasurably below every other shape and form
of degradation and distress; who had been most rudely thrust out
of the family of Adam, and forced to herd with swine; who, without
the slightest offence, had been made the footstool of the worst
criminals; whose"tears were their meat night and day," while, under
nameless insults and killing injuries they sympathy; not a statement

It is in obedience to the Bible, that we apply self-evident truths, and
walk in the light of general principles. When our fathers proclaimed
these truths, and at the hazard their property, reputation, life, stood
up in their defence, they had to provide for, they might discriminate
between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, what they ought to
attempt and what they ought to eschew? From this pointed, significant
appeal of the Savior, it is clear and certain, that in human consciousness
may be found self-evident truths, self-manifested they, and did homage

]
The town of
Paita is itself an open place; its sole protection and defence is a small
fort near the shore of the bay. It was of consequence to us to be well
informed of the fabric and strength of this fort; and by the examination
of our prisoners we found that there were eight pieces of cannon mounted
in it, but that it had neither ditch nor out work, being only surrounded
by a plain brick wall; and that the garrison consisted of only one weak
company, but the town itself might possibly arm three hundred men more.

PREPARING FOR A NIGHT ATTACK.

Mr. Anson having informed himself of the strength of the place, resolved
to attempt it that very night. We were then about twelve leagues distant
from the shore, far enough to prevent our being discovered, yet not so
far but that, by making all the sail we could, we might arrive in the bay
with our ships in the night. However, the Commodore prudently considered
that this would be an improper method of proceeding, as our ships, being
such large bodies, might be easily discovered at a distance even in the
night, and might thereby alarm the inhabitants and give them an
opportunity of removing their valuable effects. He therefore, as the
strength of the place did not require our whole force, resolved to
attempt it with our boats only, ordering the eighteen-oared barge and our
own and the Trial's pinnaces on that service; and having picked out
fifty-eight men to man them, well provided with arms and ammunition, he
gave the command of the expedition to Lieutenant Brett, and gave him his
necessary orders. And the better to prevent the disappointment and
confusion which might arise from the darkness of the night and the
ignorance of the streets and passages of the place, two of the Spanish
pilots were ordered to attend the lieutenant and to conduct him to the
most convenient landing-place, and were afterwards to be his guides on
shore. And that we might have the greater security for their faithful
behaviour on this occasion, the Commodore took care to assure all our
prisoners that if the pilots acted properly they should all of them be
released and set on shore at this place; but in case of any misconduct or
treachery, he threatened them that the pilots should be instantly shot
and that he would carry all the rest of the Spaniards who were on board
him prisoners to England.

During our preparations the ships themselves stood towards the port with
all the sail they could make, being secure that we were yet at too great
a distance to be seen. But about ten o'clock at night, the ships being
then within five leagues of the place, Lieutenant Brett, with the boats
under his command, put off, and arrived at the mouth of the bay without
being discovered; but no sooner had he entered it than some of the people
on board a vessel riding at anchor there perceived him, who instantly put
off in their boat, rowing towards the fort, shouting and crying, "The
English! the English dogs!" by which the whole town was suddenly alarmed;
and our people soon observed several lights hurrying backwards and
forwards in the fort and other marks of the inhabitants being in great
motion. Lieutenant Brett on this encouraged his men to pull briskly up to
the shore, that they might give the enemy as little time as possible to
prepare for their defence. However, before our boats could reach the
shore, the people in the fort had got ready some of their cannon and
pointed them towards the landing-place; and though in the darkness of the
night it might be well supposed that chance had a greater share than
skill in their direction, yet the first shot passed extremely near one of
the boats, whistling just over the heads of the crew. This made our
people redouble their efforts, so that they had reached the shore, and
were in part disembarked by the time the second gun fired. As soon as our
men landed they were conducted by one of the Spanish pilots to the
entrance of a narrow street, not above fifty yards distant from the
beach, where they were covered from the fire of the fort; and being
formed in the best manner the shortness of the time would allow, they
immediately marched for the parade, which was a large square at the end
of this stree, the fort being one side of the square and the Governor's
house another. In this march (though performed with tolerable regularity)
the shouts and clamours of three-score sailors who had been confined so
long on ship-board, and were now for the first time on shore in an
enemy's country--joyous as they always are when they land, and animated
besides in the present case with the hopes of an immense pillage--the
huzzahs, I say, of this spirited detachment, joined with the noise of
their drums and favoured by the night, had augmented their numbers, in
the opinion of the enemy, to at least three hundred; by which persuasion
the inhabitants were so greatly intimidated that they were much more
solicitous about the means of their flight than of their resistance. So
that though upon entering the parade our people received a volley from
the merchants who owned the treasure then in the town, and who, with a
few others, had ranged themselves in a gallery that ran round the
Governor's house, yet that post was immediately abandoned upon the first
fire made by our people, who were thereby left in quiet possession of the
parade.

A SMART PIECE OF WORK.

On this success Lieutenant Brett divided his men into two parties,
ordering one of them to surround the Governor's house, and, if possible,
to secure the Governor, whilst he himself with the other marched to the
fort with an intent to force it. But, contrary to his expectation, he
entered it without opposition; for the enemy, on his approach, abandoned
it, and made their escape over the walls. By this means the whole place
was mastered in less than a quarter of an hour's time from the first
landing, with no other loss than that of one man killed on the spot and
two wounded, one of whom was the Spanish pilot of the Teresa, who
received a slight bruise by a ball which grazed on his wrist. Indeed,
another of the company, the Honourable Mr. Keppel. son to the Earl of
Albemarle, had a very narrow escape; for having on a jockey cap, one side
of the peak was shaved off close to his temple by a ball, which, however,
did him no other injury. And now Lieutenant Brett, after this success,
placed a guard at the fort, and another at the Governor's house, and
appointed sentinels at all the avenues of the town, both to prevent any
surprise from the enemy, and to secure the effects in the place from
being embezzled. And this being done, his next care was to seize on the
custom-house where the treasure lay, and to examine if any of the
inhabitants remained in the town, that he might know what further
precautions it was necessary to take. But he soon found that the numbers
left behind were no ways formidable; for the greatest part of them (being
in bed when the place was surprised) had run away with so much
precipitation that they had not given themselves time to put on their
clothes. And in this precipitate rout the Governor was not the last to
secure himself for he fled betimes, half-naked. The few inhabitants who
remained were confined in one of the churches under a guard, except some
stout Negroes who were found in the place. These, instead of being shut
up, were employed the remaining part of the night to assist in carrying
the treasure from the custom-house and other places to the fort. However,
there was care taken that they should be always attended by a file of
musketeers.

The transporting the treasure from the custom-house to the fort was the
principal occupation of Mr. Brett's people after he had got possession of
the place. But the sailors, while they were thus employed, could not be
prevented from entering the houses which lay near them in search of
private pillage. And the first things which occurred to them being the
clothes which the Spaniards in their flight had left behind them, and
which, according to the custom of the country, were most of them either
embroidered or laced, our people eagerly seized these glittering habits,
and put them on over their own dirty trousers and jackets; not
forgetting, at the same time, the tie or bag-wig, and laced hat, which
were generally found with the clothes. When this practice was once begun
there was no preventing the whole detachment from imitating it; and those
who came latest into the fashion, not finding men's clothes sufficient to
equip themselves, were obliged to take up with women's gowns and
petticoats, which (provided there was finery enough) they made no scruple
of putting on and blending with their own greasy dress. So that, when a
party of them thus ridiculously metamorphosed first appeared before Mr.

wrote that he had powerfully urged Sir George Prevost to send further
reinforcements, as he was sure they could be spared. As to to his majesty's
arms, in that officer's defeat and surrender, as a the same time, truth
compels us to add, that Sir George Prevost took credit to himself, to
which he was not entitled, when he wrote to Lord Bathurst:" General

your excellency of the capture of this very important post: 2,500 troops

other officers, as well as of the intrepidity of the troops under the
command of Major-General Brock.
And the next day, which was the 12th
of February, we being by that time considerably advanced, the barge was
again despatched, and particular instructions given to the officers to
preserve themselves from being seen from the shore. On the 19th of
February she returned, and we found that we were indeed disappointed in
our expectation of intercepting the galleon before her arrival at
Acapulco; but we learned other circumstances which still revived our
hopes, and which, we then conceived, would more than balance the
opportunity we had already lost. For though our negro prisoners* informed
us that the galleon arrived at Acapulco on our 9th of January, which was
about twenty days before we fell in with this coast, yet they at the same
time told us that the galleon had delivered her cargo and was taking in
water and provisions for her return, and that the Viceroy of Mexico had
by proclamation fixed her departure from Acapulco to the 14th of March,
New Style.

(*Note. Three negroes in a fishing canoe had been captured by the
Centurion's barge off Acapulco harbour.)

This last news was most joyfully received by us, as we had no doubt but
she must certainly fall into our hands, and as it was much more eligible
to seize her on her return than it would have been to have taken her
before her arrival, as the specie for which she had sold her cargo, and
which she would now have on board, would be prodigiously more to be
esteemed by us than the cargo itself, great part of which would have
perished on our hands, and no part of it could have been disposed of by
us at so advantageous a mart as Acapulco.

Thus we were a second time engaged in an eager expectation of meeting
with this Manila ship, which, by the fame of its wealth, we had been
taught to consider as the most desirable prize that was to be met with in
any part of the globe.


CHAPTER 22.
THE Manila* TRADE.

(*Note. The capital of Luzon, the chief island of the Philippine group.
The Philippines were discovered in 1521 by Magellan, who was killed there
by the natives. They were annexed by Spain in 1571 and were ceded to the
United States of America in 1898, together with Cuba, after the brave but
futile attempt of the Spaniards to preserve what were almost the last
relics of their colonial dominions.)

The trade carried on from Manila to China, and different parts of India,
is principally for such commodities as are intended to supply the
kingdoms of Mexico and Peru. These are spices; all sorts of Chinese silks
and manufactures, particularly silk stockings, of which I have heard that
no less than 50,000 pairs were the usual number shipped on board the
annual ship; vast quantities of Indian stuffs--as calicoes and chintzes,
which are much worn in America; together with other minuter articles--as
goldsmith's work, etc., which is principally done at the city of Manila
itself by the Chinese, for it is said there are at least 20,000 Chinese
who constantly reside there, either as servants, manufacturers, or
brokers. All these different commodities are collected at Manila, thence
to be transported annually in one or more ships to the port of Acapulco.

THE Manila SHIP.

This trade from Manila to Acapulco and back again is usually carried on
in one or at most two annual ships, which set sail from Manila about
July, arrive at Acapulco in the December, January, or February following,
and, having there disposed of their effects, return for Manila some time
in March, where they generally arrive in June, so that the whole voyage
takes up very near an entire year. For this reason, though there is often
no more than one ship employed at a time, yet there is always one ready
for the sea when the other arrives, and therefore the commerce at Manila
are provided with three or four stout ships that, in case of any
accident, the trade may not be suspended. [124]
From these humiliating occurrences on Lake Ontario, we turn to the
captured post of Detroit, which, it will be remembered, was left by
Major-General Brock in charge of Colonel Proctor. No sooner had intelligence
of the surrender of Hull reached Washington, than the renewal of the
North-Western army for the recovery of the Michigan territory became
the anxious object of the American government. That army, which
eventually outnumbered the former one, was placed under the command of
Major-General Harrison, (who died a few years since while president of
the United States,) and in September was in full march for the Miami
rapids, the spot assigned as the general rendezvous.

In January, 1813, Colonel Proctor received information that a brigade of
that army, under Brigadier Winchester, was encamped at Frenchtown, on the
river Raisin, 40 miles south of Detroit. The British commander, although
he had orders not to act on the offensive, promptly determined to attack
this brigade before it was reinforced by the main body, a few days march
in the rear; and with his disposable force, consisting of 500 regulars,
militia, and seamen, he made a resolute assault, at dawn on the 22d,
on the enemy's camp, which was completely successful. In this affair the
Americans lost between 3 and 400 men killed; and Brigadier Winchester, 3
field officers, 9 captains, 20 subalterns, and upwards of 500 men, in
prisoners. This gallant exploit secured Detroit from any immediate danger,
but the day after it was sadly tarnished by the straggling Indians,
who massacred such wounded prisoners as were unable to walk, the
guard left for their protection deserting their charge on a false
alarm of General Harrison's approach.

This success, for which Colonel Proctor was immediately promoted to the
rank of Brigadier, together with the spoil obtained at Frenchtown,
brought down several warlike tribes of Indians from the river
Wabash, and even from the more distant Mississippi, to join the
British standard.

Towards the end of March, Proctor learnt that General Harrison
intended to commence active operations for the recovery of the
Michigan territory, on the arrival of considerable reinforcements
which he was expecting.

Resolved to try the issue of another attack before the enemy, already much
superior in numbers, gained a fresh acquisition of strength, Proctor
embarked at Amherstburg with 520 regulars and 460 militia, and made for
the mouth of the Miami, which falls into Lake Erie. He ascended that
river, about 1,200 Indians co-operating with him, and landed his troops,
stores, and ordnance, on the 28th of April, near Fort Meigs, mounting
eighteen guns, which he cannonaded from both banks of the Miami, On the
5th of May the enemy's long-expected reinforcements, under Major-General
Clay, came suddenly down the river; they were 1,300 strong, but
newly-raised militia; and as the boats drew near, Harrison ordered Clay
to storm the British batteries on the opposite or north side of the river,
while a sortie was made from the fort for the purpose of capturing the
three British guns on the southern bank. For a short period the British
batteries on both sides were in the hands of the enemy, but they were
quickly regained by bayonet charges; and on the north bank Colonel
Dudley, after spiking the captured guns, having marched with 400 men to
attack the British camp, was drawn into an ambuscade by the Indians,
and himself and about half his men were slain. Of the Americans, about
550 men were made prisoners, and their killed and wounded were estimated
at nearly as many more. The far-famed Tecumseh buried his tomahawk in the
head of a Chippewa chief, whom he found actively engaged in
massacring some of the prisoners.

But as the Indians retired, as is their wont after success, to enjoy their
plunder; and as many of the militia were also returning to their homes,
Proctor was compelled to raise the siege of Fort Meigs. Having re-embarked
his small force of regulars, chiefly of the 41st, and the whole of his
ordnance and stores, he proceeded to Sandwich; while General Harrison
abandoned all intention of advancing against Detroit until the American
squadron had gained the command of Lake Erie.

Major-General Proctor having determined to recommence his attacks against
the American North-Western army, whose head quarters were then in the
neighbourhood of Sandusky Bay, on Lake Erie, he landed on the 1st of August
near the Sandusky river, and soon after invested with 400 regulars and
between 3 and 400 Indians, Fort Stephenson, about 20 miles from its
mouth. On the 2d, a fire was opened from two 6-pounders and two 5-1/2-inch
howitzers against the fort, which appears to have possessed only one
masked 6-pounder, and to have been garrisoned by about 180 men, under
Major Croghan, but as the fire produced no impression, the place was
ordered to be stormed. The assailants reached the ditch which was
raked by the masked gun, and sustained in consequence so severe a loss,
that they retreated precipitately, having their leader, Brevet Lieut-Colonel
Short, of the 41st, with 3 officers and 52 men, killed or missing,
besides 3 officers and 38 men wounded; while the Americans had
only 1 killed and 7 slightly wounded.

The Indians did not assist in the assault, withdrawing to a ravine out of
gun shot. Thus foiled, Proctor retired on the 3d, and after abandoning
"considerable baggage and a gun-boat laden with cannon ball," he
returned to Amherstburg. The attack is said to have been "ill digested,"
and the expedition to have ended with "some disgrace."
Towards the end of August, (1813,) the American squadron, under Commodore
Perry, became too powerful for the British, under Captain Barclay, who
now remained at Amherstburg to await the equipment of the Detroit,
recently launched. The British forces in the neighbourhood falling short
of various supplies, for which they depended chiefly upon the fleet,
Captain Barclay had no other alternative than to risk a general engagement.
With this purpose he sailed on the 9th of September, with his small squadron
wretchedly manned, and the next day encountered the enemy. For some
time the fate of the battle poised in favor of the British, as the
principal American ship, the Lawrence, struck her colours; but a
sudden breeze turned the scale against them, and the whole of their
squadron was compelled to surrender, after a desperate engagement
of upwards of three hours.

Captain Barclay was dangerously wounded; Captain Finnis, of the
Queen Charlotte, killed; and every commander and officer second in
command was either killed or wounded.

Major-General Proctor's army was deprived, by this disastrous defeat, of
every prospect of obtaining its necessary supplies through Lake Erie,
and a speedy retreat towards the head of Lake Ontario became
inevitable.
Stung with grief and indignation, Tecumseh at first refused to agree to
the measure, and in a council of war held at Amherstburg on the 18th of
September, he thus delivered his sentiments against it:

Father, listen to your children! You have them now all before you.

The war before this, our British father gave the hatchet to his red
children, when our old chiefs were alive. They are now dead. In that war
our father was thrown on his back by the Americans, and our father
took them by the hand without our knowledge; and we are afraid that our
father will do so again at this time.

The summer before last, when I came forward with my red brethren, and
was ready to take up the hatchet in favor of our British father, we were
told not to be in a hurry,--that he had not yet determined to fight the
Americans.

Listen! When war was declared, our father stood up and gave us the tomahawk,
and told us that he was then ready to strike the Americans; that
he wanted our assistance; and that he would certainly get us hack
our lands, which the Americans had taken from us.

Listen! You
told us, at that time, to bring forward our families to this place,
and we did so; and you promised to take care of them, and that they
should want for nothing, while the men would go and fight the enemy;
that we need not trouble ourselves about the enemy's garrisons;
that we knew nothing about them, and that our father would attend
to that part of the contest.

You also told your red children that you would take good care of your
garrison here, which made our hearts glad.

Listen! When we were last at the Rapids, it is true we gave you little
assistance. It is hard to fight people who live like ground hogs.

Father, listen! Our fleet has gone out; we know they have fought; we
have heard the great guns; but we know nothing of what has happened
to our father with that arm.

Our ships have gone one way, and we are much astonished to see our father
tying up every thing and preparing to run away the other, without letting
his red children know what his intentions are.
You always told us to remain here and take care of our lands; it
made our hearts glad to hear that was your wish. Our great father, the
king, is the head, and you represent him. You always told us that you
would never draw your foot off British ground; but now, father,
we see you are drawing back, and we are sorry to observe our father doing
so without seeing the enemy. We must compare our father's conduct to a
fat dog, that carries its tail upon its back, but when affrighted, it drops
it between its legs and runs off.

Father, listen! The Americans have not yet defeated us by land; neither
are we sure that they have done so by water: _we therefore wish to remain
here and fight our_ _enemy, should they make their appearance_. If
they defeat us, we will _then_ retreat with our father.

At the battle of the Rapids, last war, the Americans certainly defeated
us; and, when we retreated to our father's fort in the neighbourhood, the
gates were shut against us. We were afraid that it would again be the
case; but, instead of closing the gates, we now see our British father
preparing to march out of his garrison.

Father! You have got the arms and ammunition which our great father
sent for his red children. If you intend to retreat, give them to us,
and you may go, and welcome for us. Our lives are in the hands of the Great
Spirit. We are determined to defend our lands, and if it be His will, we
wish to leave our bones upon them.

General Harrison's troops were soon transported by the American squadron
to _Put-in-Bay_, and they occupied Amherstburg on the 23d of September,
Proctor having previously fallen back upon Sandwich, after setting fire
to the navy yard, barracks, and public stores at the former place. The
British general, seeing the enemy determined to follow up his first
success by an immediate attack upon Detroit, and being unable with
his very inferior numbers to dispute the occupancy of that post,
evacuated it and Sandwich on the 26th, also destroying the public
property at both posts; and commenced his retreat along the river
Thames, with between 900 and 1,000 regulars, chiefly of the 41st
regiment.

In this reverse of fortune, Tecumseh still adhered to the British
standard with unswerving fidelity, and with the Indians covered the
retreat.

On the 2d of October, General Harrison marched in pursuit with
rather above 3,000 men, escorted by three gun-boats and a number of
bateaux. On the 4th, he came up with the rear guard, and not only made
some prisoners, but succeeded in capturing a great part of the ammunition
and stores. By this second reverse, the British were left destitute
of the means of subsistence and protracted defence; and their commander
being thus compelled to stake the fate of his small army on a general
engagement, he took up an excellent position on the right bank of the
Thames at the Moravian town, an Indian village 80 miles from Sandwich,
his entire force now mustering barely 900 regulars and about 600 Indians.
The former were posted in single files in two lines, their left resting
on the river, their right on a narrow swamp, beyond which were the
Indians, reaching obliquely backwards to a second and much broader swamp,
so that neither flank of the allies could be easily turned. The enemy
commenced the attack with a regiment of mounted riflemen, the _élite_
of their army, formed into two divisions of 500 men each, one of which
charged the regulars with great impetuosity, while the other advanced
with a company of foot against the Indians. The regulars, dissatisfied
by fancied or real neglect, and dispirited by long continued exposure
and privation, made but a very feeble resistance; their ranks were pierced
and broken, and being placed between two fires, they immediately
surrendered, with the trifling loss of 12 killed and 22 wounded, the British
general and a part of the troops seeking safety in flight. But the Indians
carried on the contest with the left of the American line with great
determination, and did not retreat until the day was irretrievably
lost and 33 of their numbers had been slain, including the noble
Tecumseh--a warrior not less celebrated for his courage than for
his humanity, his eloquence, and his influence over the different
tribes.

The Americans returned to Sandwich immediately after the action.
Proctor is accused of leaving entire the bridges and roads in the rear
of his retreating army, and of encumbering it with an unnecessary
quantity of his own personal baggage; and certain it is that his defeat
led to the harshest recrimination between Sir George Prevost and himself.
The general order of the former on the subject was of unparalleled
severity, as he said: "On this disgraceful day upwards of 600 officers
and soldiers were taken prisoners almost without a struggle, of
whom but very few appeared to have been rescued by an honorable
death from the ignominy of passing under the American yoke; nor are
there many whose wounds plead in mitigation of this reproach."

The fugitives made the best of their way to Ancaster, at the head of Lake
Ontario; and on the 17th of October they numbered there 240,
including the general and 17 officers. The consequence of these disasters
was the relinquishment, by the British, of the Michigan territory, with
the exception of Michilimakinack; the abandonment of the posts in
Upper Canada to the westward of the Grand River, or Ouse; and the loss
of the services of the whole of the north-western Indians, with
the exception of 2 or 300, who subsequently joined the centre
division of the army.[125]
Fort George was taken in May, 1813, by a large American force, under
General Dearborn, which compelled Major-General Vincent to withdraw
his troops from Fort Erie and Chippewa, and to retreat to Burlington
Heights, at the head of Lake Ontario, the British losing 52 killed,
besides upwards of 300 wounded and missing.

Immediately
after the capture of Fort George, General Dearborn pushed forward
a body of 3,000 infantry, with nine field pieces and 250 cavalry,
for the purpose of dislodging Major-General Vincent from his position.

Lieut.-Colonel Harvey,[126] deputy adjutant-general, proposed a
night attack on this body, which was approved, and with the 49th, under
Major Plenderleath, and five companies of the 8th, under Major Ogilvie,
(the whole only 704 firelocks,) he led the attack in gallant style, and
completely succeeded in surprising the enemy, who evinced a highly
creditable state of order and discipline in repeatedly forming, though
compelled as often to disperse before the resistless energy of the British
bayonet. Two brigadiers, (Chandler and Winder,) 7 other officers and 116
men, with three guns and one brass howitzer, were taken in this intrepid
attack, which, as it reduced the Americans from offensive to
defensive operations, was of the greatest importance to the salvation
of the Upper Province. The enemy, however, occupied Fort George till the
month of December, when they were compelled to evacuate it and
retreat across the Niagara.[127] In that month, Colonel Murray surprised,
and very gallantly captured by a night assault, Fort Niagara, which was
retained by the British till the end of the war.

The recovery of Michilimakinack had long been seriously contemplated by
the American government, and would have been attempted in the fall of
1813, but for the lateness of the season, when the expulsion of the
British from the banks of the Detroit had opened the passage into Lake
Huron. On the other hand, the necessity of retaining a post so favorably
situated, if in the hands of an enemy, for annoying the British
north-western trade, pressed itself on Sir George Prevost; and in
April, 1814, a reinforcement of about 90 men, under an active and
zealous officer, Lieut.

-Colonel M'Douall, was forwarded with military stores and provisions, by a
back route to Michilimakinack. They embarked in twenty-four bateaux from
Nottawassega Bay on Lake Huron, distant 260 miles from Michilimakinack,
and, after a very tempestuous passage of twenty-five days, reached the
fort on the 18th of May. On the 26th July, an American expedition from
Lake Erie, consisting of three brigs and two schooners of war, under
Captain Sinclair, with nearly 800 troops on board, appeared off
Michilimakinack, and a landing was effected by them on the 4th of August.
The British force on the island amounted to only 190 men, including
regulars, militia, and Indians, with which Lieut.-Colonel M'Donall
repulsed every effort of the Americans to approach the fort; so that
they were glad, to re-embark the same evening in the utmost haste and
confusion, leaving 17 dead on the ground, while the garrison had only
one Indian killed. Captain Sinclair stated what does not appear to
have been known to Lieutenant Hanks, when he surrendered the island in
1812 to Captain Roberts,[128] "that Michilimakinack is by nature a perfect
Gibraltar, being a high inaccessible rock on every side,[129] except
the west, from which to the heights you have nearly two miles to pass
through a wood so thick, that our men were shot in every direction,
and within a few yards of them, without being able to see the
Indians who did it."

Michilimakinack remained unmolested to the end of the war, when it
was restored, by the treaty of peace, to its former possessors.

It has already been mentioned, that among the prisoners taken at the battle
of Queenstown, 23 were sent to England for trial as British born subjects
and deserters, and that the American government had placed an equal
number of British soldiers into close confinement as hostages. In
consequence, Sir George Prevost, by a general order of the 27th October,
1813, made known that he had received the commands of the prince regent
to put 46 American officers and non-commissioned officers into close
confinement as hostages for the 23 soldiers confined by the American
government. He at the same time apprized that government, that if any of
the British soldiers should suffer death by reason of the guilt
and execution of the traitors taken in arms against their country, he was
instructed to select out of the American hostages double the number of
the British soldiers who might be so unwarrantably put to death, and to
cause them to suffer death immediately.
On the 6th of May we for the last time lost sight of the
mountains of Mexico, persuaded that in a few weeks we should arrive at
the river of Canton in China, where we expected to meet with many English
ships, and numbers of our countrymen, and hoped to enjoy the advantages
of an amicable, well-frequented spot, inhabited by a polished people, and
abounding with the conveniences and indulgences of a civilised
life--blessings which now for nearly twenty months had never been once in
our power.

(*Note. Before leaving the American coast for China, Anson released
fifty-seven of his prisoners, including all the Spaniards, and sent them
to Acapulco. A certain number of natives were retained to assist in
working the ships. There had been some previous attempt at correspondence
between Anson and the Spanish governor of Acapulco. The latter, with
Spanish courtesy, when answering Anson's letter, despatched with his
answer "a present of two boats laden with the choicest refreshments and
provisions which were to be found in Acapulco." Unfortunately the boats
were unable to find Anson, and he never received either the letter or the
present.)


CHAPTER 25.
DELAYS AND ACCIDENTS--SCURVY AGAIN--A LEAK--THE GLOUCESTER ABANDONED.

When on the 6th of May, 1742, we left the coast of America, we stood to
the south-west with a view of meeting with the north-east trade wind,
which the accounts of former writers made us expect at seventy or eighty
leagues distance from the land. We had, besides, another reason for
standing to the southward, which was the getting into the latitude of 13
or 14 degrees north, that being the parallel where the Pacific Ocean is
most usually crossed, and consequently where the navigation is esteemed
the safest. This last purpose we had soon answered, being in a day or two
sufficiently advanced to the south. At the same time we were also farther
from the shore than we had presumed was necessary for falling in with the
tradewind; but in this particular we were most grievously disappointed,
for the wind still continued to the westward, or at best variable. As the
getting into the north-east trade was to us a matter of the last
consequence, we stood more to the southward, and made many experiments to
meet with it, but all our efforts were for a long time unsuccessful, so
that it was seven weeks from our leaving the coast before we got into the
true trade wind.

CONTRARY AND VARIABLE WINDS.

This was an interval in which we believed we should well-nigh have
reached the easternmost parts of Asia, but we were so baffled with the
contrary and variable winds which for all that time perplexed us, that we
were not as yet advanced above a fourth part of the way. The delay alone
would have been a sufficient mortification, but there were other
circumstances attending it which rendered this situation not less
terrible, and our apprehensions perhaps still greater, than in any of our
past distresses, for our two ships were by this time extremely crazy, and
many days had not passed before we discovered a spring in the foremast of
the Centurion, which rounded about twenty-six inches of its
circumference, and which was judged to be at least four inches deep; and
no sooner had our carpenters secured this with fishing it but the
Gloucester made a signal of distress, and we learned that she had a
dangerous spring in her mainmast, so that she could not carry any sail
upon it. Our carpenters, on a strict examination of this mast, found it
so very rotten and decayed that they judged it necessary to cut it down
as low as it appeared to have been injured, and by this it was reduced to
nothing but a stump, which served only as a step to the topmast. These
accidents augmented our delay and occasioned us great anxiety about our
future security, for on our leaving the coast of Mexico the scurvy had
begun to make its appearance again amongst our people, though from our
departure from Juan Fernandez we had till then enjoyed a most
uninterrupted state of health. We too well knew the effects of this
disease from our former fatal experience to suppose that anything but a
speedy passage could secure the greater part of our crew from perishing
by it, and as, after being seven weeks at sea, there did not appear any
reasons that could persuade us we were nearer the trade wind than when we
first set out, there was no ground for us to suppose but our passage
would prove at least three times as long as we at first expected, and
consequently we had the melancholy prospect either of dying by the scurvy
or perishing with the ship for want of hands to navigate her.

SLOW PROGRESS.

When we reached the trade wind, and it settled between the north and the
east, yet it seldom blew with so much strength but the Centurion might
have carried all her small sails abroad with the greatest safety, so that
now, had we been a single ship, we might have run down our longitude
apace, and have reached the Ladrones soon enough to have recovered great
numbers of our men who afterwards perished. But the Gloucester, by the
loss of her mainmast, sailed so very heavily that we had seldom any more
than our topsails set, and yet were frequently obliged to lie to for her,
and I conceive that in the whole we lost little less than a month by our
attendance upon her, in consequence of the various mischances she
encountered. In all this run it was remarkable that we were rarely many
days together without seeing great numbers of birds, which is a proof
that there are many islands, or at least rocks, scattered all along at no
very considerable distance from our track. Some indeed there are marked
in Spanish charts, but the frequency of the birds seems to evince that
there are many more than have been hitherto discovered, for the greatest
part of the birds, we observed, were such as are known to roost on shore,
and the manner of their appearance sufficiently made out that they came
from some distant haunt every morning, and returned thither again in the
evening, for we never saw them early or late, and the hour of their
arrival and departure gradually varied, which we supposed was occasioned
by our running nearer their haunts or getting farther from them.

The trade wind continued to favour us without any fluctuation from the
end of June till towards the end of July, but on the 26th of July, being
then, as we esteemed, about three hundred leagues distant from the
Ladrones, we met with a westerly wind, which did not come about again to
the eastward in four days' time. This was a most dispiriting incident, as
it at once damped all our hopes of speedy relief, especially, too, as it
was attended with a vexatious accident to the Gloucester, for in one part
of those four days the wind flattened to a calm, and the ships rolled
very deep, by which means the Gloucester's forecap split and her topmast
came by the board and broke her foreyard directly in the slings. As she
was hereby rendered incapable of making any sail for some time, we were
obliged, as soon as a gale sprung up, to take her in tow, and near twenty
of the healthiest and ablest of our seaman were taken from the business
of our own ship and were employed for eight or ten days together on board
the Gloucester in repairing her damages. May every possible success attend

the battle of Queenstown, Major-General Brock wrote copious
instructions for the guidance of the officers commanding at the

attacked, and he explained the probable points which he thought the
enemy would select for accomplishing his descent.

He evidently entertained a high opinion of the discipline and prowess

had suspected this invasion, and the evening preceding it he called his
staff together, and almost gave to each the necessary instructions.
Agreeably to his usual custom, he rose before daylight, and hearing
the cannonade, awoke Major Glegg and called for his horse under Captain
Wool, who had succeeded in gaining the brow of the heights in rear of the
battery and part who died not long after him in Centurion consequence of,

to remount, but were obliged to retire precipitately with the twelve
men stationed in the battery, which was quickly occupied by the
enemy.

Captain Wool
having sent forward about 150 regulars, the Williams' detachment,
of about 100 men, advanced to meet them, personally directed by the
general, above, observing the enemy to waver, ordered a charge,
which was promptly executed; but as the Americans gave way, the
result was not equal He had that instant said:" Push on the York

His majesty has lost in him not only an able and meritorious. He died
unmarried, and on the same day a week previously, he had completed his
forty-third year. The lifeless corpse was immediately conveyed into
a house at Queenstown, where it remained until the afternoon unperceived
by the enemy. His provincial aide-de-camp, Lieut.-Colonel M'Donell, of
the militia, and the attorney-general of Upper Canada--a fine promising
young man--was mortally wounded soon after his chief, and died the
next day, at the early age of twenty-five years. Although one
bullet had passed through his body, and he was wounded in four places,
yet he survived twenty hours; and during a period of excruciating
agony, his thoughts chiefly of the York volunteers, by which charge the

green facings--could not in a manner corresponding with the elevated
virtues of 18-pounder and in the battery there. The flank companies of

of the American officers were on the point of hoisting a Brock may be
said to have fallen in the midst of his career, yet his previous services

new motive to exertion in the obligation to secure his ashes his
dispirited troops.

They now opened a heavy fire of musketry; conspicuous from his dress, his
height it on his memory. But at this anxious moment other feelings are
excited by his loss. General Brock had the confidence of the inhabitants
within his government. He had secured their attachment permanently
by his own merits. They were one people animated by one disposition,
and this he had gradually wound up to the crisis in which they were of the
British general of, and the enthusiasm with which he animated
troops retreated the advance his brave troops, adding in front of Vromont's
battery, where they awaited the expected reinforcements. The Americans
remained in quiet possession of the heights of Queenstown for some hours,
during which they were but partially reinforced, as their militia, who a

following observations:" The private letters from Upper Canada, in giving

In the midst of these gloomy reflections Mr. Anson had doubtless his
share of disquietude, but he always kept up his usual composure and
steadiness; and having soon projected a scheme for extricating himself
and his men from their present anxious situation, he first communicated
it to some of the most intelligent persons about him; and having
satisfied himself that it was practicable, he then endeavoured to animate
his people to a speedy and vigorous prosecution of it. With this view he
represented to them how little foundation there was for their
apprehensions of the Centurion's being lost; that he was not without
hopes that she might return in a few days, but if she did not, the worst
that could be supposed was that she was driven so far to the leeward of
the island that she could not regain it, and that she would consequently
be obliged to bear away for Macao, on the coast of China; that, as it was
necessary to be prepared against all events, he had, in this case,
considered of a method of carrying them off the island and joining their
old ship the Centurion again at Macao; that this method was to haul the
Spanish bark on shore, to saw her asunder, and to lengthen her twelve
feet, which would enlarge her to near forty tons burthen, and would
enable her to carry them all to China. We rise in rebellion against a

On our arrival we found that the Spanish bark, the old object of their
hopes, had undergone a new metamorphosis, for those we had left on shore
began to despair of our return, and conceiving that the lengthening the
bark as formerly proposed was both a toilsome and unnecessary measure,
considering the small number they consisted of, they had resolved to join
her again and to restore her to her first state; and in this scheme they
had made some progress for they had brought the two parts together, and
would have soon completed her had not our coming back put a period to
their labours and disquietude.

But the venerable rival of verity and exemption was himself under attraction

a encyclical to the church a Colosse, which was habituate to encounter at
the dwelling of Philemon, and another text to that magnanimous Mahayanist,
and sent them by the fist of Onesimus. thus much for_the property_ in
which Onesimus was sent rearward to his artist. A person escapes
from a antediluvian in Georgia, and seeks a refuge in the parish of the
CT doctor of quality, who formerly gave public observation that he see no
explanation for caring for the bondage of his male force.[43] Under
his power, Caesar becomes a Christian Converso. Burning with worship for
the Junior whom he hath beget in the Gospels, our abortionist
resolves to send him rearward to his maestro. consequently, he
writes a missive, gives it to Caesar, and countermand him return,
staff in extremity, to the" corner-stone of our republican issuer."

Now, what
would my Caesar do, who had ever felt a nexus of slavery's catena?

As he left his_spiritual father_, should we be surprised to hear him say
to himself, What, repatriation of my own harmony to the babu who, with the
hand of a robber, plucked me from my ma's bosom!--for whom I have been
thus rarely drenched in the perspiration of unrequited toil!--whose
aggression so rarely reduce my person and scarred my limbs!--who shut
away every light of dark from my mind!--who put dibs to those symbol to
which my Creator and Redeemer only are ennoble! And for what am I to
homecoming? To be cursed, and smitten, and sold!

To be tempted, and tear, and destruct!

I cannot thus shed myself away--thus dash upon my own destruction.[

writes the believer,"he hath wronged thee, or oweth the aught, set

would"restore" whatever he"had occupy off." He would candidly give his
debts. This document the apostle heartily approved. He was ready,
at whatever disbursal, to assist his immature Mahayanist in transport it
into empty offspring.

Of this he assured Philemon, in communication the most implicit and emphatic.
hither we lose one explanation for the behavior of Saul in sending
Onesimus to Philemon. If a person person of the Rev. Dr. Smylie, of
Mississippi, should return to him with a encyclical from a theologian

before; perhaps there might not be one amongst all the Chinese employed
in this fishery who had ever seen any European vessel; so that we might
reasonably have expected to have been considered by them as a very
uncommon and extraordinary object.

CHINESE INDIFFERENCE.

But though many of their vessels came close to the ship, yet they did not
appear to be at all interested about us. Nor did they deviate in the
least from their course to regard us; which insensibility, especially of
maritime persons about a matter in their own profession, is scarcely to
be credited, did not the general behaviour of the Chinese in other
instances furnish us with continual proof of a similar turn of mind.

anchored in Macao road. Thus, after a fatiguing cruise of above two
years' continuance, we once more arrived in an amicable port in a
civilised country, where the conveniences of life were in great plenty;
where the naval stores, which we now extremely wanted, could be in some
degree procured; where we expected the inexpressible satisfaction of
receiving letters from our relations and friends; and where our
countrymen who were lately arrived from England would be capable of
answering the numerous enquiries we were prepared to make both about
public and private occurrences, and to relate to us many particulars
which, whether of importance or not, would be listened to by us with the
utmost attention, after the long suspension of our correspondence with
our country to which the nature of our undertaking had hitherto subjected
us.


CHAPTER 31.
MACAO--INTERVIEW WITH THE GOVERNOR--A VISIT TO CANTON.

The city of Macao is a Portuguese settlement situated in an island at the
mouth of the river of Canton. It was formerly a very rich and populous
city, and capable of defending itself against the power of the adjacent
Chinese governors, but at present it is much fallen from its ancient
splendour; for though it is inhabited by the Portuguese and has a
governor nominated by the King of Portugal, yet it subsists merely by the
sufferance of the Chinese, who can starve the place and dispossess the
Portuguese whenever they please. This obliges the Governor of Macao to
behave with great circumspection, and carefully to avoid every
circumstance that may give offence to the Chinese. The river of Canton,
at the mouth of which this city lies, is the only Chinese port frequented
by European ships, and this river is indeed a more commodious harbour on
many accounts than Macao. But the peculiar customs of the Chinese, only
adapted to the entertainment of trading ships, and the apprehensions of
the Commodore lest he should embroil the East India Company with the
Regency of Canton if he should insist on being treated upon a different
footing than the merchant men, made him resolve to go first to Macao
before he ventured into the port of Canton. Indeed, had not this reason
prevailed with him, he himself had nothing to fear, for it is certain
that he might have entered the port of Canton, and might have continued
there as long as he pleased, and afterwards have left it again, although
the whole power of the Chinese Empire had been brought together to oppose
him.

The Commodore, not to depart from his usual prudence, no sooner came to
an anchor in Macao road than he despatched an officer with his
compliments to the Portuguese Governor of Macao, requesting His
Excellency by the same officer to advise him in what manner it would be
proper to act to avoid offending the Chinese, which, as there were four
of our ships in their power at Canton, was a matter worthy of attention.
The difficulty which the Commodore principally apprehended related to the
duty usually paid by all ships in the river of Canton, according to their
tonnage. For as men-of-war are exempted in every foreign harbour from all
manner of port charges, the Commodore thought it would be derogatory to
the honour of his country to submit to this duty in China; and therefore
he desired the advice of the Governor of Macao, who, being a European,
could not be ignorant of the privileges claimed by a British man-of-war,
and consequently might be expected to give us the best lights for
avoiding this perplexity. Our boat returned in the evening with two
officers sent by the Governor, who informed the Commodore that it was the
Governor's opinion that if the Centurion ventured into the river of
Canton, the duty would certainly be demanded; and therefore, if the
Commodore approved of it, he would send him a pilot who should conduct us
into another safe harbour, called the Typa, which was every way
commodious for careening the ship (an operation which we were resolved to
begin upon as soon as possible), and where the above-mentioned duty would
in all probability be never asked for.

The information received from a deserter, and which I had the honor
to detail in my last, is far from correct, and, where credit is to be
given, the facts apply solely to the regular force. The militia,
being selected from the most violent democrats, are generally inclined
to invade this province--provisions are in tolerable plenty--the only
complaint arises from a want of vegetables.

It is currently reported that the enemy's force is to be increased to
7,000, and that on their arrival an attack is immediately to be made.
I am convinced the militia would not keep together in their present situation
without such a prospect, nor do I think the attempt can be long
deferred.
Sickness prevails in some degree along the line, but principally at Black
Rock.

The flank companies of the royal Newfoundland have joined me.
A sergeant and twenty-five rank and file of the Veterans arrived at the
same time, whom I propose sending to Michilimakinack.

The enclosed letter from Colonel Proctor will inform your excellency
of a force having been detached, under Captain Muir, for the reduction
of Fort Wayne.[91] I gave orders for it previous to my leaving
Amherstburg, which must have induced Colonel Proctor to proceed,
upon receiving intelligence of the recommencement of hostilities,
without waiting for further directions.

I regret exceedingly that this service should be undertaken contrary to
your excellency's wishes; but I beg leave to assure you, that the principal
object in sending a British force to Fort Wayne is with the hope of
preserving the lives of the garrison. By the last accounts, the place was
invested by a numerous body of Indians, with very little prospect of being
relieved. The prisoners of war, who know perfectly the situation of the
garrison, rejoiced at the measure, and give us full credit for our
intentions.

The Indians were likewise looking to us for assistance: they heard
of the armistice with every mark of jealousy, and, had we refused
joining them in the expedition, it is impossible to calculate the
consequences.

I have already been asked to pledge my word that England would enter
into no negociation in which their interests were not included,
and, could they be brought to imagine that we should desert them,
the consequences must be fatal.

I shall be obliged to your excellency to direct £5,000 to be transmitted
to the receiver-general, for the civil expenditure of this province.
Army bills, I make no doubt, will answer every purpose.

This dispatch is entrusted to Lieut.-Colonel Nichol, quartermaster-general
of this militia, whom I take the liberty to introduce to your excellency,
as perfectly qualified, from his local knowledge and late return,
to afford every information of the state of affairs in the western
district.

He is instructed
to make extensive purchases of necessaries for the use of the militia,
  and I have to entreat your excellency to indulge him with the means
of a speedy conveyance back to this place.

_Major-General Brock to his brother Savery_.

FORT GEORGE, September 18, 1812.

You doubtless feel much anxiety on my account. I am really placed in a most
awkward predicament. If I get through my present difficulties with
tolerable success, I cannot but obtain praise. But I have already surmounted
difficulties of infinitely greater magnitude than any within my view.
Were the Americans of one mind, the opposition I could make would be
unavailing; but I am not without hope that their divisions may be the
saving of this province. A river of about 500 yards broad divides the
troops. My instructions oblige me to adopt defensive measures, and I
have evinced greater forbearance than was ever practised on any former
occasion. It is thought that, without the aid of the sword, the American
people may be brought to a due sense of their own interests. I firmly
believe I could at this moment sweep every thing before me between Fort
Niagara and Buffalo--but my success would be transient.

I have now officers in whom I can confide: when the war commenced,
I was really obliged to seek assistance among the militia. The 41st is
an uncommonly fine regiment, but wretchedly officered. Six companies
of the 49th are with me here, and the remaining four at Kingston, under
Vincent.
Although the regiment has been ten years in this country, drinking rum
without bounds, it is still respectable, and apparently ardent for an
opportunity to acquire distinction:
it has five captains in England, and two on the staff in this
country, which leaves it bare of experienced officers.

The U.S. regiments of the line desert over to us frequently, as the men
are tired of the service: opportunities seldom offer, otherwise I
have reason to think the greater part would follow the example.

The militia, being chiefly composed of enraged democrats, are more
ardent and anxious to engage, but they have neither subordination
nor discipline.

They die very fast.
You will hear of some decisive action in the course of a fortnight, or
in all probability we shall return to a state of tranquillity. I say
decisive, because if I should be beaten, the province is inevitably gone;
and should I be victorious, I do not imagine the gentry from the other
side will be anxious to return to the charge.

It is certainly something singular that we should be upwards of two
months in a state of warfare, and that along this widely extended
frontier not a single death, either natural or by the sword, should have
occurred among the troops under my command, and we have not been
altogether idle, nor has a single desertion taken place.

I am quite anxious for this state of warfare to end, as I wish much to
join Lord Wellington, and to see you all.

Has poor Betsey recovered the loss of my young and dear friend, John
Tupper?

_Sir George Prevost to Major-General Brock._
MONTREAL, September 25, 1812.

It no longer appears, by your letter of the 13th, that you consider the
enemy's operations on the Niagara frontier indicative of active
operations. If the government of America inclines to defensive measures,
I can only ascribe the determination to two causes: the first is, the
expectation of such overtures from us as will lead to a suspension of
hostilities, preparatory to negociations for peace; the other arises
from having ascertained, by experience, our ability in the Canadas to
resist the attack of a tumultuary force.

In consequence of your having weakened the line of communication between
Cornwall and Kingston, a predatory warfare is carrying on there very
prejudicial to the intercourse from hence with Upper Canada. I have
ordered a company of the Glengary to Prescott to strengthen Colonel
Lethbridge, and, under present circumstances, you are not to expect further
aid.

I agree in opinion with you, that so wretched is the organization and
discipline of the American army, that at this moment much might be
effected against them; but as the government at home could derive no
substantial advantage from any disgrace we might inflict on them,
whilst the more important concerns of the country are committed in
Europe, I again request you will steadily pursue that policy which
shall appear to you best calculated to promote the dwindling away of
such a force by its own inefficient means.

I shall receive with much satisfaction Colonel Proctor's report of having
saved the garrison of Fort Wayne from the inhuman fury of the Indians.
I am particularly anxious that class of beings should be restrained
and controlled as much as possible, whilst there exists a pretence
of implicating the national character in their cruelties.

* * * * *
The following letter not only explains the impolicy of obeying Sir
George Prevost's provisional orders for the evacuation of Detroit
and the Michigan territory, but also ably deprecates any abandonment of
our Indian allies. With such leaders as its author and Tecumseh, what might
not have been done in this war to obtain the security and regeneration
of this much injured people? But alas! these "kindred spirits" lived not
long enough to plead their cause, and in the negociations for peace their
interests were shamefully overlooked or cruelly forgotten;[92]
although, in the first American war, the Indians had also, with
few exceptions, taken part with Great Britain against the colonists in
their contest for independence. It is true that their mode of warfare
is abhorrent to Europeans, as differing from the more _honorable_ slaughter
of _civilized_ enemies; but Sir Isaac Brock proved that they were
to be restrained, and Tecumseh was as humane as he was brave.
Moreover, we should not condemn their previous excesses without remembering
the many injuries they had received. They knew from sad experience that
they could place no faith in the whites, who had long considered them as
legal prey, and too often treated them as the brute animals of the forest.
Expelled from the coasts, and dispossessed of their hunting grounds,
they had been gradually driven westward, until they had too much cause
to apprehend that the cupidity of their invaders would be satisfied only
with their utter extermination. "The red men are melting," to borrow
the expressive metaphor of a celebrated Miami chief of the last
century, "like snow before the sun."

Indeed, it is melancholy to reflect, that the aborigines of both
continents of America have, from their first intercourse with
Europeans or their descendants, experienced nothing but fraud,
spoliation, cruelty, and ingratitude.

_Major-General Brock to Sir George Prevost_.

YORK, September 28, 1812.

I have been honored with your excellency's dispatch, dated the 14th
instant.[93] I shall suspend, under the latitude left by your excellency
to my discretion, the evacuation of Fort Detroit. Such a measure would
most probably be followed by the total extinction of the population
on that side of the river, or the Indians, aware of our weakness and
inability to carry on active warfare, would only think of entering into
terms with the enemy. The Indians, since the Miami affair, in 1793,
have been extremely suspicious of our conduct; but the violent wrongs
committed by the Americans on their territory, have rendered it an act
of policy with them to disguise their sentiments. Could they be persuaded
that a peace between the belligerents would take place, without
admitting their claim to an extensive tract of country,
fraudulently usurped from them, and opposing a frontier to the present
unbounded views of the Americans, I am satisfied in my own mind that they
would immediately compromise with the enemy. I cannot conceive a
connection so likely to lead to more awful consequences.

If we can maintain ourselves at Niagara, and keep the communication
to Montreal open, the Americans can only subdue the Indians by craft,
which we ought to be prepared to see exerted to the utmost. The enmity of
the Indians is now at its height, and it will require much management
and large bribes to effect a change in their policy; but the moment
they are convinced that we either want the means to prosecute the war
with spirit, or are negociating a separate peace, they will begin
to study in what manner they can most effectually deceive us.

Should negociations for peace be opened, I cannot be too earnest with
your excellency to represent to the king's ministers the expediency of
including the Indians as allies, and not leave them exposed to the
unrelenting fury of their enemies.

The enemy has evidently assumed defensive measures along the strait of
Niagara. His force, I apprehend, is not equal to attempt, with any
probability of success, an expedition across the river. It is,
however, currently reported that large reinforcements are on their
march; should they arrive, an attack cannot be long delayed. The
approach of the rainy season will increase the sickness with which
the troops are already afflicted.

Those under my command are in perfect health and spirits.

I have the honor to transmit the purport of a confidential communication[94]
received in my absence by Brigade-Major Evans from Colonel Van Rensselaer.
As your excellency's instructions agree with the line of conduct he is
anxious I should follow, nothing of a hostile nature shall be attempted
under existing circumstances.

* * * * *
The unlettered Tecumseh well knew the wrongs of the red men when he
endeavoured, several years before the war, to induce the Osages to unite
in a general Indian confederacy against the continued encroachments
of the Americans, and gave extemporaneous utterance before a large
assemblage to the following simple but faithful narration of their
grievances.

The harangue, eloquent as it is, suffers under all the disadvantages of
translation, and is but the shadow of the substance, because the gestures,
and the interests and feelings excited by the occasion, which constitute
the essentials of its character, are altogether wanting.

Brothers,--We all belong to one family; we are all children of the Great
Spirit; we walk in the same path; slake our thirst at the same
spring; and now affairs of the greatest concern lead us to smoke the
pipe around the same council fire!

Brothers,--We are friends; we must assist each other to bear our
burdens.

The blood of many of our fathers and brothers has run like water on the
ground, to satisfy the avarice of the white men. We, ourselves, are
threatened with a great evil; nothing will pacify them but the destruction
of all the red men.

Brothers,--When the white men first set foot on our grounds, they were
hungry; they had no place on which to spread their blankets, or to kindle
their fires. They were feeble; they could do nothing for themselves. Our
fathers commiserated their distress, and shared freely with them whatever
the Great Spirit had given his red children. They gave them food when
hungry, medicine when sick, spread skins for them to sleep on, and gave
them grounds, that they might hunt and raise corn.--Brothers, the
white people are like poisonous serpents:
when chilled, they are feeble and harmless; but invigorate them with
warmth, and they sting their benefactors to death.

The white people came among us feeble; and now that we have made
them strong, they wish to kill us, or drive us back, as they would
wolves and panthers.

Brothers,--The white men are not friends to the Indians: at first, they
only asked for land sufficient for a wigwam; now, nothing will satisfy
them but the whole of our hunting grounds, from the rising to the
setting sun.

Brothers,--The white men want more than our hunting grounds; they
wish to kill our old men, women, and little ones.

Brothers,--Many
winters ago, there was no land; the sun did not rise and set; all
was darkness.

The Great Spirit made all things. He gave the white people a home beyond
the great waters. He supplied these grounds with game, and gave them to
his red children; and he gave them strength and courage to defend
them.

Brothers,--My people wish for peace; the red men all wish for peace; but
where the white people are, there is no peace for them, except it be on
the bosom of our mother.

Brothers,--The white men despise and cheat the Indians; they
abuse and insult them; they do not think the red men sufficiently
good to live.

The red men have borne many and great injuries; they ought to suffer
them no longer. My people will not; they are determined on vengeance;
they have taken up the tomahawk; they will make it fat with blood;
they will drink the blood of the white people.

Brothers,--My people are brave and numerous; but the white people are too
strong for them alone. I wish you to take up the tomahawk with them.
If we all unite, we will cause the rivers to stain the great waters with
their blood.

Brothers,--If you do not unite with us, they will first destroy us, and
then you will fall an easy prey to them. They have destroyed many nations
of red men, because they were not united, because they were not friends
to each other.

Brothers,--The white people send runners amongst us; they wish to
make us enemies, that they may sweep over and desolate our hunting
grounds, like devastating winds, or rushing waters.

Brothers,--Our Great Father, over the great waters, is angry with the white
people, our enemies. He will send his brave warriors against them; he
will send us rifles, and whatever else we want--he is our friend,
and we are his children.

Brothers,--Who are the white people that we should fear them?
They cannot run fast, and are good marks to shoot at: they are only
men; our fathers have killed many of them: we are not squaws, and we
will stain the earth red with their blood.

Brothers,--The Great Spirit is angry with our enemies; he speaks in
thunder, and the earth swallows up villages, and drinks up the Mississippi.
The great waters will cover their lowlands; their corn cannot grow;
and the Great Spirit will sweep those who escape to the hills from the
earth with his terrible breath.

Brothers,--We must be united; we must smoke the same pipe; we must fight
each other's battles; and, more than all, we must love the Great Spirit:
he is for us; he will destroy our enemies, and make all his red children
happy.

Conclusion of Major-General Brock's general order, Detroit, 16th August,
1812: "The conduct of the Indians under Colonel Elliott, Captain M'Kee,
and the other officers of that department, joined to that of the gallant
and brave chiefs of their respective tribes, has since the commencement
of the war been marked with acts of true heroism, and in nothing
can they testify more strongly their love to the king, their great
father, than in following the dictates of honor and humanity, by
which they have been hitherto actuated.

Two fortifications have already been captured from the enemy, without
a drop of blood being shed by the hands of the Indians: the instant
the enemy submitted, his life became sacred."

extraordinary circumstance, that a staff officer was sent, express

CHAPTER XIV.

The Americans, burning to wipe away the stain of their discomfiture at
Detroit, and apparently determined to penetrate into Upper Canada at any
risk, concentrated with those views, along the Niagara frontier, an army
consisting, according to their own official returns, of 5,206 men, under
Major-General Van Rensselaer, of the New York militia, exclusive of 300
field and light artillery, 800 of the 6th, 13th, and 23d regiments, at
Fort Niagara; making a total of 6,300 men. Of this powerful force,
1,650 regulars, under the command of Brigadier Smyth, were at Black
Rock; 386 militia at the last named place and Buffalo; and 900 regulars
and 2,270 militia at Lewistown, distant from Black Rock 28 miles.
Thus the enemy had, along their frontier of 36 miles, 3,650 regulars and
2,650 militia.[95] To oppose this force Major-General Brock, whose head
quarters were at Fort George, had under his immediate orders part of the
41st and 49th regiments, a few companies of militia, amounting to
nearly half these regulars, and from 200 to 300 Indians--in all
about 1,500 men--but so dispersed in different posts at and between
Fort Erie and Fort George, (34 miles apart,) that only a small
number was quickly available at any one point.

With unwearied diligence the British commander watched the motions
of the enemy; but under these circumstances it was impossible to
prevent the landing of the hostile troops, especially when their
preparations were favored by the obscurity of the night.

On the 9th of October, the brig Detroit, of 200 tons and 6 guns, (lately
the U.S. brig Adams,) and the North-West Company's brig Caledonia, of
about 100 tons, having arrived the preceding day from Detroit, were boarded
and carried opposite Fort Erie, before the dawn of day, by Lieutenant
Elliott, of the American navy, with 100 seamen and soldiers in two
large boats. This officer was at this time at Black Rock, superintending
the equipment of some schooners, lately purchased for the service
of Lake Erie. But for the _defensive_ measures to which Major-General
Brock was restricted, he would probably have destroyed these very
schooners, for whose equipment, as vessels of war, Lieutenant Elliott
and 50 seamen had been sent from New York.All this
time, too, he was very solicitous to keep at such a distance from the
cape as not to be discovered; but it has been since learned that
notwithstanding his care, he was seen from the land, and advice of him
was sent to Manila, where it was at first disbelieved; but on reiterated
intelligence (for it seems he was seen more than once) the merchants were
alarmed, and the Governor was applied to, who undertook (the commerce
supplying the necessary sums) to fit out a force consisting of two ships
of 32 guns, one of 20 guns, and two sloops of 10 guns each, to attack the
Centurion on her station. And some of these vessels did actually weigh
with this view, but the principal ship not being ready, and the monsoon
being against them, the commerce and the Government disagreed, and the
enterprise was laid aside. This frequent discovery of the Centurion from
the shore was somewhat extraordinary, for the pitch of the cape is not
high, and she usually kept from ten to fifteen leagues distant, though
once, indeed, by an indraught of the tide, as was supposed, they found
themselves in the morning within seven leagues of the land.


CHAPTER 34.
THE CAPTURE OF THE GALLEON.

As the month of June advanced, the expectancy and impatience of the
Commodore's people each day increased, and I think no better idea can be
given of their great eagerness on this occasion than by copying a few
paragraphs from the journal of an officer who was then on board, as it
will, I presume, be a more natural picture of the full attachment of
their thoughts to the business of their cruise than can be given by any
other means. The paragraphs I have selected, as they occur in order of
time are as follows:

May 31. Exercising our men at their quarters, in great expectation of
meeting with the galleons very soon, this being the 11th of June, their
style.

June 3. Keeping in our stations and looking out for the galleons.

June 5. Begin now to be in great expectations, this being the middle of
June, their style.

June 11. Begin to grow impatient at not seeing the galleons.

June 13. The wind having blown fresh easterly for the forty-eight hours
past, gives us great expectations of seeing the galleons soon.

June 15. Cruising on and off and looking out strictly.

June 19. This being the last day of June, New Style, the galleons, if
they arrive at all, must appear soon.

The Centurion being thus prepared, and nearing the galleon apace, there
happened, a little after noon, several squalls of wind and rain, which
often obscured the galleon from their sight; but whenever it cleared up
they observed her resolutely lying to, and towards one o'clock the
Centurion hoisted her broad pendant and colours, she being then within
gun shot of the enemy; and the Commodore, observing the Spaniards to have
neglected clearing their ship till that time, as he then saw them
throwing over board cattle and lumber, he gave orders to fire upon them
with the chase guns to embarrass them in their work, and prevent them
from completing it, though his general directions had been not to engage
till they were within pistol-shot. The galleon returned the fire with two
of her stern-chasers, and the Centurion getting her sprit sail-yard fore
and aft, that if necessary she might be ready for boarding, the Spaniards
in a bravado rigged their spritsail-yard fore and aft likewise. Soon
after the Centurion came abreast of the enemy within pistol-shot, keeping
to the leeward with a view of preventing them from putting before the
wind and gaining the port of Jalapay, from which they were about seven
leagues distant. And now the engagement began in earnest, and for the
first half-hour Mr. Anson overreached the galleon and lay on her bow,
where by the great wideness of his ports he could traverse almost all his
guns upon the enemy, whilst the galleon could only bring a part of hers
to bear. Immediately on the commencement of the action the mats with
which the galleon had stuffed her netting took fire and burned violently,
blazing up half as high as the mizzen top. This accident (supposed to be
caused by the Centurion's wads) threw the enemy into great confusion, and
at the same time alarmed the Commodore, for he feared lest the galleon
should be burned, and lest he himself too might suffer by her driving on
board him. But the Spaniards at last freed themselves from the fire by
cutting away the netting, and tumbling the whole mass which was in flames
into the sea. But still the Centurion kept her first advantageous
position, firing her cannon with great regularity and briskness, whilst
at the same time the galleon's decks lay open to her topmen, who having
at their first volley driven the Spaniards from their tops, made
prodigious havoc with their small arms, killing or wounding every officer
but one that ever appeared on the quarter-deck, and wounding in
particular the General of the galleon himself; and though the Centurion,
after the first half-hour, lost her original situation and was close
alongside the galleon, and the enemy continued to fire briskly for near
an hour longer, yet at last the Commodore's grape-shot swept their decks
so effectually, and the number of their slain and wounded was so
considerable, that they began to fall into great disorder, especially as
the General, who was the life of the action, was no longer capable of
exerting himself. Their embarrassment was visible from on board the
Commodore, for the ships were so near that some of the Spanish officers
were seen running about with great assiduity to prevent the desirtion of
their men from their quarters. But all their endeavours were in vain, for
after having, as a last effort, fired five or six guns with more judgment
than usual, they gave up the contest, and the galleon's colours being
singed off the ensign staff in the beginning of the engagement, she
struck the standard at her main top-gallant masthead, the person who was
employed to do it having been in imminent peril of being killed, had not
the Commodore, who perceived what he was about, given express orders to
his people to desist from firing.


Thus was the Centurion possessed of this rich prize, amounting in value
to near a million and a half of dollars. She was called the "Nuestra
Senora de Cabadonga", and was commanded by the General Don Jeronimo de
Montero, a Portuguese by birth, and the most approved officer for skill
and courage of any employed in that service. The galleon was much larger
than the Centurion, and had five hundred and fifty men and thirty-six
guns mounted for action, besides twenty-eight pidreroes in her gunwale,
quarters, and tops, each of which carried a four-pound ball. She was very
well furnished with small arms, and was particularly provided against
boarding, both by her close quarters and by a strong network of 2-inch
rope, which was laced over her waist and was defended by half-pikes. "The
transport of the American stores, ordnance, and provisions, of each of
which they were much in want, not being prohibited by that armistice,
was accordingly protected and facilitated by it on Lake Ontario
and along the Niagara frontier beyond the enemy's most sanguine
hopes, whilst their then only disposable and invading force, under
General Hull, on the Detroit frontier, was left at full liberty to
profit by circumstances, the armistice as to him being at his
option.

"Most fortunately, however, Hull's business was settled by capitulation
before the armistice was known to General Brock or him; but had it
reached him in time, he of course would gladly have accepted it,
to gain delay for the arrival of reinforcements and a supply of provisions,
from which would have resulted the salvation of his army, the prejudicial
consequences whereof to us are incalculable; for, had a knowledge of it
reached the Indian nations at that time, such a disgust and distrust
would have been thereby excited as could never have been removed; and
the first effect of which would have appeared in the immediate dispersion
of the Indians, whose powerful and indispensable aid at that early
period of the contest would have been totally lost to us.

"Madison's rejection of this armistice was followed by that _chilling
defensive system_ which General Brock was instructed by Sir George to
follow, and which palsied his operations until his country had to mourn
over his fatal loss at the battle of Queenstown, on the 13th of October,
1812.

"Such, however, was the impulse he had given, and the valour and zeal
wherewith the regular troops, militia and Indians, had been inspired,
that the valuable effects thereof survived him; and gave a brilliant
victory on that day to his successor, General Sheaffe, a lover of
armistices also, who, in proof thereof, made _one of his own_,
which threw away most of the advantages of that victory; for he
neglected (although strongly urged thereto) to take Fort Niagara,
which could have been done on the afternoon of the day of the
Queenstown battle, without loss, as the enemy had entirely, or
almost entirely, then evacuated it: had he done this, and at the
same time crossed over a part of his force to Lewistown, as he was
urged to do, and as Brock would have done had he survived, the whole
Niagara line would have been cleared of the enemy, and all our after
disasters in that quarter prevented.

"It has been urged in favor of Sir George's timid defensive system,
that it was proper in order to avoid irritating the enemy, and
thereby uniting them; as also, that his force was inadequate to
offensive warfare.

Now, no positions were ever more untenable, for to think of conciliating
an enemy by leaving to him the full benefit of maturing in security
all his means of annoyance against you, and at the same time muzzling
yourself, is a most extraordinary doctrine; surely, to do so must ensure
success to that enemy, as we know that success will unite discordant
parties and interests, whilst defeats promote disunion, and would have
strengthened the anti-war party in the States, by furnishing to them
unanswerable arguments when depicting the folly and impolicy of
the war, which had been so wantonly declared by the Madisonian
party.

"Were facts
in support of this view of the subject necessary, they would be
found in the effects upon the public mind in that country, produced
by the capture of Michilimakinack and Detroit, with Hull's army.

Did these events irritate and unite the enemy against us? No, they
increased irritation, it is true, but against their own government."

(In his tenth or concluding letter, Veritas recapitulated his
preceding arguments, and observed:) "That to General Brock's zeal and
energy, left as he was without orders, along with other causes independent
of Sir George, the preservation of Upper Canada, in the first instance,
and of Lower Canada as a consequence, are mainly to be ascribed."

No. 4. Page 277.

_Extract from Sir George Prevost's General Order, Montreal, August
31, 1812, in announcing the refusal of the American President to
continue the armistice._
"The invasion of the Upper Province, undertaken so immediately after the
declaration of war, shews in the strongest manner how fully they had
prepared themselves for that event, and how highly they had flattered
themselves with finding it an easy conquest, from the supposed weakness
of the force opposed to them, and the spirit of disaffection which
they had previously endeavoured to excite amongst its inhabitants.

Foiled as they have been in this attempt by the brave and united
efforts of the regular forces, militia, and Indians of that province,
under the command of their distinguished leader, their whole army
with its general captured, and their only remaining fortress and
post in the adjoining territory wrested from them, it is not to be
doubted but that the American government will keenly feel this
disappointment of their hopes, and consequently endeavour to avail
themselves of the surrender of Detroit, to term it an invasion of
their country, and to make it a ground for calling upon the militia
to march to the frontiers for the conquest of the Canadas.

A pretext so weak and unfounded, though it may deceive some, will not fail
to be received in its proper light by others; and it will be immediately
perceived by those who will give themselves the trouble to reflect on
the subject, that the pursuit of an invading army into their own
territory, is but a natural consequence of the first invasion; and
the capture of the place, to which they may retire for safety, a measure
indispensably necessary for the security and protection of the
country originally attacked."

No. 5. Page 333.

"To Colonel Brock, of the 49th, who commanded at the fort, I am particularly
indebted for his kindness to me during the fortnight I remained at Niagara.
Among many pleasant days which I passed with him and his brother
officers, that of our visit to the Tuscorora Indians was not the least
interesting. They received us in all their ancient costume; the young men
exhibited for our amusement in the race, the bat game, &c, while the
old and the women sat in groups under the surrounding trees, and the
picture altogether was as beautiful as it was new to me."--_Note in
Moore's Epistles, Odes, &c_.

"At Queenstown the battle was fought in which General Brock fell,
and the inhabitants point out a thorn bush at the bottom of the heights,
where it is said that he received his mortal wound.

His career was a short but a brilliant one; and had the direction of the
affairs of the Upper Province, after his death, been characterized by
an equal degree of courage, prudence, and humanity, a very different
series of subsequent events would have claimed the attention of the
historian."--_Duncan's Travels in the United States and Canada, in 1818
and 1819_.

"Close to the spot where we landed in Canada, there stands a monument
to the gallant General Brock, who was killed during the battle of
Queenstown, in the act of repelling an invasion of the frontier by the
Americans, during the late war.... The view from the top of the monument
extended far over Lake Ontario, and showed us the windings of the
Niagara, through the low and woody country which hangs like a rich green
fringe along the southern skirts of that great sheet of water,"--_Captain
Basil Hall's Travels in North America, in 1827 and 1828_.

Travelling in the state of New York, the author observes: "The late
Sir Isaac Brock was, by some accident, mentioned.

The canal agent spoke of him in terms of great respect, as the best commander
the British had ever sent to Canada--equally regretted on both sides of
the St.
Lawrence...."
"From Niagara Falls we proceeded by the stage first to Queenstown, (seven
miles,) near which a monument has been erected to the memory of Sir
Isaac Brock, from the top of which, about 120 feet high, there is a noble
view of Lake Ontario and the adjoining country, and thence to the village
of Newark, (seven miles,) formerly called Fort George, on the Niagara
river."--_Stuart's Three Years in America._
"Immediately above Queenstown stands Brock's monument, on the heights where
the battle was fought in which that hero was killed. His body was
removed to it from Fort George, in 1824.
The view from this fine column is probably the most beautiful in
Upper Canada."

--_M'Gregor's British America_, vol. ii.

"Seven miles south of Fort George, and at the foot of the romantic heights
of the same name, which have become famous in Canadian history as
the scene of a battle wherein General Brock fell, is the village of
Queenstown, pleasantly situated on the Niagara, and opposite to the
American village of Lewistown. The monument, built to the memory of the
gallant general and his companions, on the loftiest part of these
heights, forms a prominent object to the numerous _voyageurs_ who are
constantly arriving at this portage, in elegantly fitted up steam boats,
from York and Kingston, to view the neighbouring falls of the Niagara.
The village contains a church, court house, large government stores,
and a population of between 400 and 500 inhabitants."--_The
Canadas, by Andrew Pichen._
"Leaving a garrison in Detroit sufficiently strong to keep the inhabitants
in awe, General Brock lost no time in quitting the conquered post and
hastening to Niagara--a command he had only relinquished for the
purpose of undertaking an achievement which the gallantry and
determination of his character could alone have crowned with such
unqualified success....

"The month
of October was marked by an event of the most melancholy nature--the
death of General Brock, who fell a victim to the intrepidity and
daring of his character....

The loss of their leader, however, cast a gloom over every English brow,
and an advantage thus purchased was deemed at too high a price. General
Brock was beloved by the soldiery, particularly the 49th, of which he
had long been lieutenant-colonel, and the indignation of their grief
for his loss cost the Americans many a life on that day, that had
otherwise been spared.

At Amherstburg, the account of his death was received with heartfelt
concern, and not a man was there of those he had lately led to
victory who failed to pay that tribute to his memory, which the
gallantry and magnanimity of this glorious chief were so every way
calculated to awaken in the breast of the soldier."

--'_A Canadian Campaign_,' _by a British Officer, in the New Monthly
Magazine for December, 1826, and February, 1827._
"Immediately opposite the town of Prescott, on the shore of the United
States, is the town of Ogdensburg; and twelve miles higher up, on the
Canadian shore, stands the delightful village of Brockville, so called in
honor of the late lamented Sir Isaac Brock. This enchanting little
spot unites in its situation every beauty of nature. In front of it flows
the river St. Lawrence, interspersed with numerous islands, variously
formed and thickly wooded; behind it is an assemblage of small hills,
rising one above another in 'gay theatric pride;' and on each side
are a number of well cleared farms, in an advanced state of cultivation.
Every thing combines to render it pre-eminently beautiful. The dwellings
are built of wood, and tastefully painted; and the court house, in an
elevated situation at the back of the village, seems, from its superior
size, to be the guardian of the villagers--an idea of my fancy, which
I did not seek to confirm by entering within its doors. Brockville
contains 450 souls. It has a parsonage house, but no church has
hitherto been erected."--_Five Years in Canada, by E.A. Talbot._
"We remained an hour or two at Brockville, the village of palaces;
and few villages have I seen more attractive than this one. It is situated
on a shelving bank, with a southern aspect, and groves of trees round it.
The houses and churches are built of grey stones, and, being covered
with tin, have a light and pleasant appearance." _Alexander's Transatlantic
Sketches._ London, 1833.

[NOTE.

--Brockville was originally named Elizabeth Town, in compliment to the
general's mother, and the township or county, in which the village
is situated, is still called Elizabeth. There is a large township bordering
the river St. Clair and Lake Huron, in about latitude 43° and
longitude 82°, in the western district of Upper Canada, named Sarnia,
the ancient name of Guernsey. This township was probably so named by Sir
Isaac Brock.]

"_Brothers_,--The Americans have long threatened to strike us, and in the
beginning of the summer they declared war against us, and lately they
recommenced hostility by invading the country at Queenstown. In this
contest, which, with the help of God, terminated in our favor, your
much lamented commander and friend, General Brock, his aide-de-camp,
Colonel M'Donell, and several warriors, have fallen.

"_Brothers_,--We therefore now, seeing you darkened with grief,
your eyes dim with tears, and your throats stopped with the force
of your affliction, with these strings of wampum we wipe away your
tears, that you may view clearly the surrounding objects.

We clear the passage in your throats that you may have free utterance for
your thoughts, and we wipe clean from blood the place of your abode,
that you may sit there in comfort, without having renewed the remembrance
of your loss by the remaining stains of blood.

Delivered eight strings of white wampum.[157]
"_Brothers_,--That the remains of our late beloved friend and commander,
General Brock, shall receive no injury, we cover it with this belt of
wampum, which we do from the grateful sensations which his kindness towards
us continually inspired, as also in conformity with the customs of our
ancestors; and we now express, with the unanimous voice of the chiefs
and warriors of our respective bands, the great respect in which we hold
his memory, and the sorrow and deep regret with which his loss has
filled our breasts, although he has taken his departure for a better
abode, where his many virtues will be rewarded by the great Dispenser of
good, who has led us on the road to victory.

A large white belt.

"_Brothers_,--We now address the successor of our departed friend, to
express the confidence we feel that his heart is warmed with similar
sentiments of affection and regard towards us.

We also assure him of our readiness to support him to the last, and
therefore take the liberty to speak strong to all his people to
co-operate with vigour, and, trusting in the powerful arm of God,
not to doubt of victory.

"Although our numbers are small, yet, counting Him on our side, who ever

"This chief of the branch of the once great tribe of the Hurons visited

deal of conversation with him. When asked what had struck him most of
all that he had seen in England, he replied, without hesitation,
that it was the monument erected in St. Paul's to the memory of General
Brock.
It seemed to have impressed him with a high idea of the considerate beneficence
of his great father, the king of England, that he not only had remembered
the exploits and death of his white child, who had fallen beyond the
big salt lake, but that he had even deigned to record, on the marble
sepulchre, the sorrows of the poor Indian weeping over his chief
untimely slain."--_Hon. F.F. De Roos' Travels in North America, in_

To His Royal Highness the Prince Regent of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland,

The humble
address of the Commons of Upper Canada, in Parliament assembled,
May it please your Royal Highness,
We, his majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects the Commons of
Upper Canada, in Provincial Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer
to your Royal Highness the homage of our unfeigned attachment to
his Majesty's sacred person and government, and of our filial
reverence for the great and magnanimous nation of which we have the
honor to form a part.

While we pray your Royal Highness to accept of our most cordial
congratulations on the splendid achievements of his Majesty's forces,
and of those of his allies in various parts of the globe, and in particular
on the extraordinary successes which, under Divine Providence, have
attended his Majesty's arms in this portion of his dominions; we should
do injustice to the memory of our late truly illustrious president,
Major-General Brock, under whose auspices the latter were during his
lifetime principally achieved, did we omit to accompany them with
feelings of the most poignant sorrow for his fall.

He had endeared himself to us by his able, virtuous, and disinterested
administration of the civil government, and by the zeal, military talent,
and bravery, which characterized and marked his conduct in the field.

To his energy, his promptitude, and his decision, do we feel ourselves in
a great degree indebted, for having at this moment the happiness of
enjoying the privileges of his Majesty's subjects. His disinterested
and manly conduct aroused the spirit of the country, and called it forth
for self-defence against a most insidious foe.

In appreciating, as we do, his talents and eminent services, most
deeply do we lament our inability to bestow on them any other reward
than our praise.

Without revenue for even the ordinary purposes of the government, we
have no funds from whence to reward merit, however exalted and deserving.

We derive, however, much pleasure from beholding that the services
of our ever-to-be-lamented president and general have been appreciated by
your Royal Highness; and while we feelingly regret that he did not
survive to enjoy the high honors conferred upon him by your Royal
Highness in his Majesty's name, we, with all humility, would beg to suggest
that a grant to his family of a portion of his Majesty's most
valuable waste lands in this province would be most gratifying to us.
It would, we doubt not, be acceptable to them, and it would be the means
of perpetuating the connection that had taken place between us, as well
as the name of Brock, in a country in defence of which the general so
nobly fell!!! and which his exertions had so eminently contributed to
save.

That your Royal Highness may long be preserved to fill the exalted
station to which you have been called for the advancement of the happiness,
honor and glory, of the British nation, is the fervent prayer of his
Majesty's faithful subjects, the Commons of Upper Canada.

The Commodore, towards the end of September, having found out (as has
been said) that those who had contracted to supply him with sea
provisions and stores had deceived him, and that the Viceroy had not sent
to him according to his promise, he saw it would be impossible for him to
surmount the embarrassment he was under without going himself to Canton,
and visiting the Viceroy. And therefore, on the 27th of September, he
sent a message to the mandarin who attended the Centurion to inform him
that he, the Commodore, intended on the 1st of October to proceed in his
boat to Canton, adding that the day after he got there he should notify
his arrival to the Viceroy, and should desire him to fix a time for his
audience; to which the mandarin returned no other answer than that he
would acquaint the Viceroy with the Commodore's intentions. In the
meantime all things were prepared for this expedition, and the boat's
crew in particular which Mr. Anson proposed to take with him, were
clothed in a uniform dress resembling that of the watermen on the Thames.
They were in number eighteen and a coxswain. They had scarlet jackets and
blue silk waistcoats, the whole trimmed with silver buttons, and with
silver badges on their jackets and caps.

A WISE PRECAUTION.

As it was apprehended, and even asserted, that the payment of the
customary duties for the Centurion and her prize would be demanded by the
Regency of Canton, and would be insisted on previous to the granting a
permission for victualling the ship for her future voyage, the Commodore,
who was resolved never to establish so dishonourable a precedent, took
all possible precautions to prevent the Chinese from facilitating the
success of their unreasonable pretentions by having him in their power at
Canton. And, therefore, for the security of his ship and the great
treasure on board her, he appointed his first lieutenant, Mr. Brett, to
be captain of the Centurion under him, giving him proper instructions for
his conduct, directing him particularly, if he, the Commodore, should be
detained at Canton on account of the duties in dispute, to take out the
men from the Centurion's prize and to destroy her, and then to proceed
down the river through the Bocca Tigris with the Centurion alone, and to
remain without that entrance till he received further orders from Mr.
Anson.

These necessary steps being taken, which were not unknown to the Chinese,
it should seem as if their deliberations were in some sort embarrassed
thereby. It is reasonable to imagine that they were in general very
desirous of getting the duties to be paid them, not perhaps solely in
consideration of the amount of those dues, but to keep up their
reputation for address and subtlety, and to avoid the imputation of
receding from claims on which they had already so frequently insisted.
However, as they now foresaw that they had no other method of succeeding
than by violence, and that even against this the Commodore was prepared,
they were at last disposed, I conceive, to let the affair drop, rather
than entangle themselves in a hostile measure which they found would only
expose them to the risk of having the whole navigation of their port
destroyed, without any certain prospect of gaining their favourite point
thereby.

BARGAINING.

When the Commodore arrived at Canton he was visited by the principal
Chinese merchants, who affected to appear very much pleased that he had
met with no obstruction in getting thither. They added that, as soon as
the Viceroy should be informed that Mr. P---- is sitting opposite to me,
and desires to be remembered. James Brock is likewise at Kingston. I
believe he considers it more his interest to remain with the 49th
than to act as my private secretary; indeed, the salary is a mere
pittance.

Poor Leggatt is dead, and has left his family in the most distressing
circumstances. His wife died last year.

Major Smelt and Captain Brown have sent me your letters, for which I thank
you. Let Richard Potenger be assured that his letter afforded me the
highest gratification. I trust in Heaven that the whole of his thoughts
will be directed to study, and to qualify himself for the holy profession
he has chosen. Ignorance is despised in most men, but more particularly
in the clergyman educated at one of the universities, who must have
neglected so many opportunities of acquiring knowledge.

I received the other day a long letter from Sir Thomas Saumarez, from
Halifax. I regret the death of the two Harry Brocks.[84] I have likewise
been particularly unfortunate in the loss of two valuable military friends.
I begin to be too old to form new friendships, and those of my youth are
dropping off fast.

General Sheaffe has lately been sent to me. There never was an
individual so miserably off for the necessary assistance. Sir George
Prevost has kindly hearkened to my remonstrances, and in some measure
supplied the deficiency. The 41st is an uncommonly fine regiment, but,
with few exceptions, badly officered. You mention John Tupper[85] in a
manner as to leave hope that he may still be living. God grant it! He is
a great favorite of mine, and I should lament any disaster happening to
him. Perhaps Glegg may be sent home by Sir George, and in that case I hope
he will allow you to see the colours taken from the 4th U.S.
regiment. The generality of the English will esteem them very little:
nothing is prized that is not acquired with blood.

KINGSTON, September 4.

I this instant receive your letters by Mr.

Todd, So honest John Tupper is gone! I could not have loved a son of
my own more ardently. Hostilities I this instant understand are to be
renewed in four days; and though landed only two hours, I must return
immediately to Niagara, whence I shall write fully.

_Lieut.-Colonel Nichol, Quartermaster-General of Militia, to
Major-General Brock._
DETROIT, August 25, 1812.

I have just been informed by Colonel Proctor that he intends sending an
express to-morrow to Fort George, which gives me an opportunity to forward
a few printed copies of your proclamation, and to inform you that
in order to carry it into effect, it has been found absolutely necessary
to organize the civil government. Under existing circumstances, I
have advised Colonel Proctor to assume the administration until your
pleasure is known, to which he has agreed, and the necessary arrangements
consequent thereto have been adopted and promulgated.

In Judge Woodward, who has been appointed secretary _pro tem_, he
will find an able coadjutor; and as your object undoubtedly was to
tranquillize the public mind and to give the inhabitants a proof
of the moderation and benevolence of his majesty's government, as
well as to ensure the due administration of the laws, I do not think
a more judicious choice could have been made.

In all the discussions which took place on this subject, Colonel Proctor
did me the honor to consult me; and I have no hesitation in saying, that
I urged him to the step he has taken, of which I hope you will, as it is
only temporary, approve. We have had much difficulty in collecting the
public cattle and horses, and have suffered greatly from the predatory
spirit of the Indians; indeed, their conduct has been infamous. There
is hardly a house on either side of the river that has not been robbed
by them; they have taken away the greater part of the captured horses and
cattle, and without our being able to prevent it. It has not been in my
power as yet to send a statement of all that we have captured, as the
property is so scattered, but I hope to finish this week. We got upwards
of £1,200 in money, and have sent down a hundred packs worth, I
suppose £1,500 more. I have reason to think the captured property will
not be much under £40,000.

We have still 350 prisoners to ship off, but I hope to get rid of them in
a few days. Public confidence seems to be partially restored; business
is again going on, and I hope that the country will become perfectly
quiet.

It is impossible for me to say when I shall get done here. I hope, however,
it will not be long. I regret that we are not able to send you complete
returns of every thing; but the captured property is in so many different
places, and so scattered, that it cannot be done.

_Extract from a Canadian Newspaper._
MONTREAL, September 12.

Last Sunday evening the inhabitants of this city were gratified with an
exhibition equally novel and interesting.

That General Hull should have entered into our city so soon, at the head
of his troops, rather exceeded our expectations.
We were, however, very happy to see him, and received him with all the
honors due to his high rank and importance as a public character. The
following particulars, relative to his journey and reception
at Montreal, may not be uninteresting to our readers:

It appears that General Hull and suite, accompanied by about 25 officers
and 350 soldiers, left Kingston, under an escort of 130 men, commanded
by Major Heathcote, of the Newfoundland regiment. At Cornwall, the
escort was met by Captain Gray, of the quartermaster-general's
department, who took charge of the prisoners of war, and from thence
proceeded with them to La Chine, where they arrived about two o'clock
on Sunday afternoon. At La Chine, Captains Richardson and Ogilvie,
with their companies of Montreal militia, and a company of the
king's from Lower Chine, commanded by Captain Blackmore, formed the
escort till they were met by Colonel Auldjo, with the remainder of
the flank companies of the militia, upon which Captain Blackmore's
company fell out and presented arms as the general and line passed,
and then returned to La Chine, leaving the prisoners of war to be
guarded by the militia alone.

The line of march then proceeded to the town in the following order,
viz:

1. Band of the king's regiment.

2. The first division of the escort.

3. General Hull in a carriage, accompanied by Captain Gray.
Captain Hull and Major Shekleton followed in the second, and some wounded
officers occupied four others.

4. The American officers.

5. The non-commissioned officers and soldiers.

6. The second division of the escort.

It unfortunately proved rather late in the evening for the vast
concourse of spectators assembled to experience that gratification
they so anxiously looked for. This inconvenience was, however, in a great
measure remedied by the illuminations of the streets through
which the line of march passed. When they arrived at the general's
house, the general was conducted in, and presented to his excellency Sir
George Prevost, and was received with the greatest politeness, and
invited to take up his residence there during his stay at Montreal. The
other officers were accommodated at Holmes' hotel, and the soldiers lodged
in the Quebec barracks. The general appears to be about sixty years of
age, and is a good looking man, and we are informed by those who
have had frequent opportunities of conversing with him, that he is a man
of general information.

He is
communicative, and seems to bear his misfortunes with a degree of
philosophical resignation that but few men in similar circumstances
are gifted with.

On Thursday last General Hull, with eight American officers, left
this city for the United States, on their parole.

CHAPTER XIII.

After issuing a proclamation to the inhabitants of the Michigan territory,
by which their private property was secured and their laws and
religion confirmed, and leaving as large a force under Colonel Proctor
as could be spared at Detroit, Major-General Brock hastened to return to
the Niagara frontier; and while on his voyage across Lake Erie, in
the schooner Chippewa, he was met on the 23d of August by the
provincial schooner Lady Prevost, of 14 guns, the commander of which,
after saluting the general with seventeen guns, came on board and gave
him the first intelligence of the armistice which Sir George Prevost
had unfortunately concluded with the American general, Dearborn.
Major-General Brock could not conceal his deep regret and mortification
at the intelligence, which he feared would prevent his contemplated attack
on Sackett's Harbour.

Sir George Prevost, early in August, on hearing of the repeal of the
British orders in council, which were the principal among the
alleged causes of the war, had proposed a suspension of hostilities until
the sentiments of the American government were received on the subject;
and to this suspension General Dearborn readily agreed, with the exception
of the forces under General Hull, who, he said, acted under the immediate
orders of the secretary at war.
But, by the terms of the truce, General Hull had the option of
availing himself of its provisions if he thought fit, and that he would
gladly have done so there can be no doubt. Happily, however, owing
to the rapidity of Major-General Brock's movements, the news of
the armistice did not reach the belligerent commanders in time to
prevent the surrender of the one, or to snatch well-earned laurels
from the brow of the other.[86] This armistice was attended with
very prejudicial consequences, as it not only marred the attempt
on Sackett's Harbour, but it rendered unavailing the command of the
lakes, which was then held by the British.[87]
The successful commander, in transmitting by Captain Glegg his
dispatches to the governor-general at Montreal, expressed, through
his aide-de-camp, his intention of proceeding immediately to Kingston,
and from thence to the attack of the naval arsenal at Sackett's
Harbour, on Lake Ontario.

Had its destruction been accomplished--and no one can doubt that
this was the proper period to attempt it, as the enemy, dispirited
by the capture of Detroit, would probably have offered but a feeble
resistance--the Americans could not, without much additional
difficulty and future risk of destruction, have built and equipped
the fleet which subsequently gave them the naval ascendancy on that
lake, and enabled them twice in 1813 to capture the capital of Upper
Canada.

The armistice, however, caused a delay of nearly a fortnight in the necessary
preparations, as Major-General Brock returned from Detroit to Fort
George on the 24th of August, and the cessation of the truce was
not known to him until his arrival at Kingston, on the 4th of September.

The distance by water between Fort George and Kingston is about 160 miles,
and from Kingston to Sackett's Harbour only 35 miles; so that the destruction
of the arsenal might have been effected early in September, had not
the armistice prevented the attempt. But, unhappily for the interests
of his country and the credit of his own fame, Sir George Prevost
disapproved of the proposition, and commanded Major-General Brock to
relinquish all idea of the contemplated enterprize, although the official
intelligence of the president's refusal to continue the suspension of
hostilities reached him at Montreal on the 30th of August, a day or
two _before_ Captain Glegg, with the dispatches and trophies of the capture
of Detroit. At the commencement of the war, a defensive attitude was
perhaps excusable, especially as the British cabinet seems to have been
anxious to accommodate the differences between the two countries; but
_after_ the American government had refused to continue the
armistice, it appears to us that Sir George Prevost was pursuing a
suicidal course, as to wait for the enemy till he shall have prepared
his forces and passed your frontiers, to plunder your towns and
occupy your country, is a very recent expedient recognized by no
government, and practised by no people of ancient or modern times.

But notwithstanding the delay caused by the armistice, the proposed
attack could still have been carried into effect after its cessation;
and it was only relinquished by express orders from the commander-in-chief.
We seek not to impugn his motives, as they probably originated in a
mistaken sense of duty, and evidently from an impression that to attack
the Americans again on their own frontier would be to render the contest
more popular among them. It was under this impression that, in a general
order[88] issued at Montreal on the 31st of August, the
commander-in-chief was weak enough to offer an indirect apology
to the American people for the invasion of their territory at Detroit.
Whether this continued defensive policy was such as, under all the
circumstances, ought to have been observed, we leave it to others to
determine; but certainly the result did not justify its expediency, and
the tree is usually judged of by its fruit. Forbearance in war,
where success is probable, strikes us as a positive evil that a very
doubtful good may ensue--it is seldom properly appreciated; and the
governor-general appears to have seen his error when too late, as in
the following year he was himself ignobly foiled in an attack on Sackett's
Harbour. We cannot understand why the attack under Sir George Prevost,
in May, 1813, was more politic than it would have been in September the
year preceding, under Major-General Brock; and although Captain Glegg
met with a very chilling reception from the former officer, yet
we would willingly acquit him of any jealous feeling where such
important interests were at stake.

At the same time it is due to the memory of this unfortunate officer
to add, that his civil administration was as able as his military one in
Canada was inglorious; and that although his conduct as a soldier was
on more than one occasion the subject of much and just animadversion in
England, yet he acquired the warm attachment of the French Canadians, who
speak highly of him to this day. Those leading men who, during the
administration of Sir James Craig, had been considered almost as enemies,
were treated with confidence by his successor, who gradually appointed
them to situations of trust, and by this wise measure secured their
aid and influence in the defence of the province. Certain it is, on the
other hand, that Major-General Brock did not approve of the defensive
warfare to which he was restricted, and subsequent events too truly
proved that had he been permitted to pursue that course which his zeal
and foresight dictated, his valuable life might have been spared, and
a very different series of incidents in that war claimed the attention
of the historian. The high-minded soldier could not brook a state of
inaction with such promising prospects before him. His best feelings
revolted at being compelled to languish within the strict pale of military
obedience, when so rich a field for doing good service presented itself;
and in place of becoming the assailant, he was soon doomed, by awaiting
the attacks of his opponents, to sacrifice not only life, but, what is
far dearer, the opening prospects of honorable ambition.

On the 16th December, 1812, the inhabitants of the Niagara district
addressed a spirited letter to Sir George Prevost, from which we
copy the following extract, as confirming what we have already
stated on the same subject: "Nevertheless, such was the popularity
of the general, such the confidence he had inspired, that he was
enabled to carry with him to Detroit, though under great privations,
a large body of volunteers, which, in addition to the small regular
force at Amherstburg, enabled him to capture an entire army of our
invaders, with the fortress from which they had made their descent
into Canada--a success unparalleled in the annals of war.

Here, for the first time, we got a supply of good arms.

The success of this first enterprize, in which the militia were
engaged, acted like an electric shock throughout the country: it
awed the disaffected, of whom there were many; it confirmed the
timid and the wavering; and it induced the Six Nation Indians, who
had until that time kept aloof, to take an active part in our favor.

At that moment such was the energy and confidence that had been excited
by our illustrious chief and the success of his plans, that had
_he_ been permitted, he could, and would, have destroyed and laid
waste the whole American frontier, from Sandusky to St.

Regis. Your excellency doubtless recollects the armistice which immediately
preceded the capture of Detroit, which gave the enemy an opportunity
to recover from their consternation, to fortify and strengthen
their lines, to accumulate in security the means of annoying us at
pleasure along our whole frontier, and which sent at least 800 of
our Indian allies in disgust to their own homes."

_Colonel Baynes to Major-General Brock._
MONTREAL, August 13, 1812.[89]
I wrote to you from Albany on the 8th instant, but as my letter was
submitted to the inspection of General Dearborn, I of course confined
myself to the sole subject of the armistice entered into with that
officer....

A clause, admitting reinforcements to pass with stores, was readily
agreed to on my part.

General Dearborn told me that a considerable reinforcement with stores
was on its way to Niagara, and that he could not delay or alter
its destination.

I informed him that we were also forwarding reinforcements and
stores, and that it would be advisable to agree that all movements
of that nature on either side should be suffered to proceed
unmolestedly by troops under instructions to preserve defensive
measures.

I am apprehensive that General Dearborn may not explicitly explain all
these points; and I have therefore cautioned all the officers, to
whom I have communicated them, to act with the utmost caution, and
to be prepared for all events that may arise.

I feel extremely prepossessed in favor of General Dearborn, whose
manners appear to evince great candour and sincerity: he assured me
that no event of his life would afford him so much satisfaction
and happiness as resigning his command in consequence of our honorable
adjustment of differences.

He told me that General Hull was placed under his orders merely for form
sake, but that he acted by particular instructions from the war
department, and would not consider himself bound to obey any order
that was not in conformity to them.

For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's
freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's
servant.

Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men." [65]
[Footnote 65: 1 Cor. vii. 20-23.]

In explaining and applying this passage, it is proper to suggest:

1.

That it _could_ not have been the object of the apostle to bind the
Corinthian converts to the stations and employments in which the
gospel found them.

For he exhorts some of them to escape, if possible, from their present
condition.

In the servile state, "under the yoke," they ought not to remain
unless impelled by stern necessity.

"If thou canst be free, use it rather."

If they ought to prefer freedom to bondage and to exert themselves
to escape from the latter for the sake of the former, could their
master consistently with the claims and spirit of the gospel have
hindered or discouraged them in so doing?

Their "brother" could _he_ be, who kept "the yoke" upon their neck, which
the apostle would have them shake off if possible?

And had such masters been members of the Corinthian church, what inferences
must they have drawn from this exhortation to their servants?

That the apostle regarded slavery as a Christian institution?

--or could look complacently on any efforts to introduce or maintain
it in the church?

Could they have expected less from him than a stern rebuke, if they
refused to exert themselves in the cause of freedom?
