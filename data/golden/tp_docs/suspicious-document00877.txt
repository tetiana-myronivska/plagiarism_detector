A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD, A BOOK FOR BOYS, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.


CHAPTER ONE.

MY HOME, AND HOW I LEFT IT.

The day arrived.  A post-chaise stood in front of the old grey
manor-house.  I have it all before me.  The pointed gables--the
high-pitched, dark weather; stained roof--the numberless latticed
windows--the moat, now dry, which had once served to keep out a body of
Cromwell's horse--the tall elms, which had nestled many a generation of
rooks--the clump of beech trees, and the venerable wide-spreading oak--
the broad gravelled court on one side, and the velvety lawn on the
other, sloping away down to the fine, large, deep fish-pond, whose
waters, on which I had obtained my first nautical experiences, as seen
through the green foliage, were sparkling brighter than ever under the
deep blue of the summer sky.

At the hall door were assembled all those I loved on earth--and dearly,
too, I loved them.  My mother, as good and kind a mother as ever nursed
a somewhat numerous and noisy progeny; my sisters, dear, sweet, good
girls; and half-a-dozen brothers, honest, generous, capital fellows; our
father, too--such a father!--we always agreed that no one could come up
to him.  Other fellows might have very good fathers, but they were not
equal to him!  The lake slept under its delicate crown of verdure.
A light mist swept softly over the waters. Suddenly the moon appeared
between the branches, and then the waves were strewn as if with countless
stars.

But George could see that the lights which irradiated the waters
were not all the broken reflections of the moon, for blue flames
advanced in circles, swaying and undulating as if in a dance.

Soon he saw that the blue flames flickered over the white faces of women,
beautiful faces rising on the crests of the waves and crowned with sea-weeds
and sea-shells, with sea-green tresses floating over their shoulders and
veils flowing from under their breasts that shimmered with pearls.

The child recognised the nixies and tried to flee. But already their
cold white arms had seized him, and in spite of his struggles and
cries he was borne across the waters along the galleries of porphyry and
crystal.

IX
Wherein we shall see how Honey-Bee was taken to the dwarfs
The moon had risen over the lake and the water now only showed broken
reflections of its disc. Honey-Bee still slept. The dwarf who had watched
her came back again on his raven followed this time by a crowd of little
men. They were very little men. Their white beards hung down to their
knees. They looked like old men with the figures of children.
By their leathern aprons and the hammers which hung from their belts
one could see that they were workers in metals. They had a curious
gait, for they leaped to amazing heights and turned the most extraordinary
somersaults, and showed the most inconceivable agility that made them
seem more like spirits than human beings.

Yet while cutting their most foolhardy capers they preserved an unalterable
gravity of demeanour, to such a degree that it was quite impossible to
make out their real characters.

They placed themselves in a circle about the sleeping child.

"Now then," said the smallest of the dwarfs from the heights of his
plumed charger; "now then, did I deceive you when I said that the
loveliest of princesses was lying asleep on the borders of the lake, and
do you not thank me for bringing you here?"
"We thank you, Bob," replied one of the dwarfs who looked like an elderly
poet, "indeed there is nothing lovelier in the world than
this young damsel. She is more rosy than the dawn which rises on the
mountains, and the gold we forge is not so bright as the gold of her
tresses."
"Very good, Pic, nothing can be truer," cried the dwarfs, "but what
shall we do with this lovely little lady?"
Pic, who looked like a very elderly poet, did not reply to this question,
probably because he knew no better than they what to do with this pretty
lady.

"Let us build a large cage and put her in," a dwarf by the name of Rug
suggested.

Against this another dwarf called Dig vehemently protested. It was Dig's
opinion that only wild beasts were ever put into cages, and there
was nothing yet to prove that the pretty lady was one of these.

But Rug clung to his idea for the reason possibly that he had no other.
He defended it with much subtlety. Said he:

"If this person is not savage she will certainly become so as a result
of the cage, which will be therefore not only useful but indispensable."

This reasoning displeased the dwarfs, and one of them named Tad denounced
it with much indignation. He was such a good dwarf.

He proposed to take the beautiful child back to her kindred who must be
great nobles.

But this advice was rejected as being contrary to the custom of the
dwarfs.

"We ought to follow the ways of justice not custom," said Tad.

But no one paid any further attention to him and the assembly broke
into a tumult as a dwarf named Pau, a simple soul but just, gave his
advice in these terms:

"We must begin by awakening this young lady, seeing she declines
to awake of herself; if she spends the night here her eyelids will
be swollen to-morrow and her beauty will be much impaired, for it
is very unhealthy to sleep in a wood on the borders of a lake."

This opinion met with general approval as it did not clash with any
other.

Pic, who looked like an elderly poet burdened with care, approached the
young girl and looked at her very intently, under the impression that a
single one of his glances would be quite sufficient to rouse the
dreamer out of the deepest sleep.

But Pic was quite mistaken as to the power of his glance, for
Honey-Bee continued to sleep with folded hands.

Seeing this the good Tad pulled her gently by her sleeve. Thereupon she
partly opened her eyes and raised herself on her elbow. When she found
herself lying on a bed of moss surrounded by dwarfs she thought what
she saw was nothing but a dream, and she rubbed her eyes to open them,
so that instead of this fantastic vision she should see the pure
light of morning as it entered her little blue room in which she
thought she was.

For her mind, heavy with sleep, did not recall to her the adventure of
the lake. But indeed, it was useless to rub her eyes, the dwarfs did
not vanish, and so she was obliged to believe that they were real.

Then she looked about with frightened eyes and saw the forest and
remembered.

"George! my brother George!" she cried in anguish. The dwarfs crowded
about her, and for fear of seeing them she hid her face in her hands.

"George! George! Where is my brother George?" she sobbed.

The dwarfs could not tell her, for the good reason that they did not
know. And she wept hot tears and cried aloud for her mother and brother.

Pau longed to weep with her, and in his efforts to console, he addressed
her with rather vague remarks.

"Do not distress yourself so much," he urged, "it would be a pity for
so lovely a young damsel to spoil her eyes with weeping. Rather tell
us your story, which cannot fail to be very amusing. We should be so
pleased."
She did not listen. She rose and tried to escape. But her bare and
swollen feet caused her such pain that she fell on her knees, sobbing
most pitifully.

Tad held her in his arms, and Pau tenderly kissed her hand. It was this
that gave her the courage to look at them, and she saw that they seemed
full of compassion.

Pic looked to her like one inspired, and yet very innocent, and perceiving
that all these little men were full of compassion for her, she said:

"Little men, it is a pity you are so ugly; but I will love you all the
same if you will only give me something to eat, for I am so hungry."
"Bob," all the dwarfs cried at once, "go and fetch some supper."
And Bob flew off on his raven. All the same, the dwarfs resented this
small girl's injustice in finding them ugly. Rug was very angry. Pic
said to himself, "She is only a child, and she does not see the light
of genius which shines in my eyes, and which gives them the power which
crushes as well as the grace which charms."
As for Pau, he thought to himself: "Perhaps it would have been better if
I had not awakened this young lady who finds us ugly." But Tad said
smiling:

"You will find us less ugly, dear young lady, when you love us more."

As he spoke Bob re-appeared on his raven. He held a dish of gold
on which were a roast pheasant, an oatmeal cake, and a bottle of claret.
He cut innumerable capers as he laid this supper at the feet of
Honey-Bee.

"Little men," Honey-Bee said as she ate, "your supper is very good. My
name is Honey-Bee; let us go in search of my brother, and then we will
all go together to Clarides where mama is waiting for us in great
anxiety."
But Dig, who was a kind dwarf, represented to Honey-Bee that
she was not able to walk; that her brother was big enough to find his own
way; that no misfortune could come to him in a country in which all the
wild beasts had been destroyed.

"We will make a litter," he added, "and cover it with leaves and moss, and
we will put you on it, and in this way we will carry you to the
mountain and present you to the King of the Dwarfs, according to
the custom of our people."
All the dwarfs applauded. Honey-Bee looked at her aching feet and
remained silent. She was glad to learn that there were no wild beasts in
the country.

And on the whole she was willing to trust herself to the kindness of the
dwarfs.

They were already busy constructing the litter. Those with hatchets were
felling two young fir trees with resounding blows. This brought back to
Rug his original suggestion.

"If instead of a litter we made a cage," he urged.

But he aroused a unanimous protest. Tad looked at him scornfully.

"You are more like a human being than a dwarf, Rug," he said. "But at
least it is to the honour of our race that the most wicked dwarf is
also the most stupid."
In the meantime the task had been accomplished. The dwarfs leaped
into the air and in a bound seized and cut the branches, out of which
they deftly wove a basket chair. Having covered it with moss and leaves,
they placed Honey-Bee upon it, then they seized the two poles, placed
them on their shoulders and, then! off they went to the mountain.

X
In which we are faithfully told how King Loc received Honey- Bee of
Clarides
They climbed a winding path along the wooded slope of the hill.

Here and there granite boulders, bare and blasted, broke through the grey
verdure of the dwarf oaks, and the sombre purple mountain with its bluish
ravines formed an impassable barrier about the desolate landscape.

The procession, preceded by Bob on his feathered steed, passed through
a chasm overgrown with brambles. Honey-Bee, with her golden hair flowing
over her shoulders, looked like the dawn breaking on the mountains,
supposing, of course, that the dawn was ever frightened and called
her mother and tried to escape, for all these things she did as she
caught a confused glimpse of dwarfs, armed to the teeth, lying in
ambush along the windings of the rocks.

With bows bent or lance at rest they stood immovable. Their tunics of wild
beast skins and their long knives that hung from their belts gave
them a most terrible appearance. Game, furred and feathered, lay
beside them. And yet these huntsmen, to judge only by their faces,
did not seem very grim; on the contrary, they appeared gentle and grave
like the dwarfs of the forest, whom they greatly resembled.

In their midst stood a dwarf full of majesty. He wore a cock feather over
his ear, and on his head a diadem set with enormous gems. His mantle
raised at the shoulder disclosed a muscular arm covered with circlets
of gold. A horn of ivory and chased silver hung from his belt.
His left hand rested on his lance in an attitude of quiet strength, and
his right he held over his eyes so as to look towards Honey-Bee and
the light.

"King Loc," said the forest dwarfs, "we have brought you the beautiful
child we have found; her name is Honey-Bee."
"You have done well," said King Loc. "She shall live amongst us according
to the custom of the dwarfs."

"Honey-Bee," he said, approaching her, "you are welcome."

He spoke very gently, for he already felt very kindly towards her. He
lifted himself on the tips of his toes to kiss her hand that hung at her
side, and he assured her not only that he would do her no harm, but that
he would try to gratify all her wishes, even should she long for
necklaces, mirrors, stuffs from Cashmere and silks from China.

"I wish I had some shoes," replied Honey-Bee. Upon which King Loc
struck his lance against a bronze disc that hung on the surface
of the rock, and instantly something bounded like a ball out of the
depths of the cavern. Increasing in size it disclosed the face of a dwarf
with features such as painters give to the illustrious Belisarius, but
his leather apron proclaimed that he was a shoemaker. He was indeed
the chief of the shoemakers.

"True," said the king, "choose the softest leather out of our store-houses,
take cloth-of-gold and silver, ask the guardian of my treasures for a
thousand pearls of the finest water, and with this leather, these
fabrics, and these pearls create a pair of shoes for the lady
Honey-Bee."
At these words True threw himself at the feet of Honey-Bee and
measured them with great care.
"Little King Loc," said Honey-Bee, "I want the pretty shoes you
promised at once, because as soon as I have them I must return to
Clarides to my mother." "You shall have the shoes," King Loc replied;
"you shall have them to walk about the mountain, but not to return
to Clarides, for never again shall you leave this kingdom, where
we will teach you wonderful secrets still unknown on earth. The
dwarfs are superior to men, and it is your good fortune that you
are made welcome amongst them."
"It is my misfortune," replied Honey-Bee. "Little King Loc, give
me a pair of wooden shoes, such as the peasants wear, and let me
return to Clarides."
But King Loc made a sign with his head to signify that this was
impossible. Then Honey-Bee clasped her hands and said, coaxingly:
"Little King Loc, let me go and I will love you very much."
"You will forget me in your shining world."
"Little King Loc, I will never forget you, and I will love you as
much as I love Flying Wind." 
"And who is Flying Wind?"
"It is my milk-white steed, and he has rose-coloured reins and he
eats out of my hand. When he was very little Francoeur the squire
used to bring him to my room every morning and I kissed him. But
now Francceur is in Rome, and Flying Wind is too big to mount the
stairs." 
King Loc smiled.
"Will you love me more than Flying Wind?"
"Indeed I would," said Honey-Bee.

"Well said," cried the King.
"Indeed I would, but I cannot, I hate you, little King Loc, because
you will not let me see my mother and George again."
"Who is George?" 
"George is George and I love him."
The friendship of King Loc for Honey-Bee had increased prodigiously
in a few minutes, and as he had already made up his mind to marry
her as soon as she was of age, and hoped through her to reconcile
men and dwarfs, he feared that later on George might become his
rival and wreck his plans.
It was because of this that he turned away frowning, his head bowed
as if with care.
Honey-Bee seeing that she had offended him pulled him gently by his
mantle.
"Little King Loc," she said, in a voice both tender and sad, "why
should we make each other unhappy, you and I?"
"It is in the nature of things," replied King Loc. "I cannot take
you back to your mother, but I will send her a dream which will
tell her your fate, dear Honey-Bee, and that will comfort her."

"Little King Loc," and Honey-Bee smiled through her tears, "what a
good idea, but I will tell you just what you ought to do. You must
send my mother a dream every night in which she will see me, and
every night you must send me a dream in which I shall see her."

And King Loc promised, and so said, so done. Every night Honey-Bee
saw her mother, and every night the Duchess saw her daughter, and
that satisfied their love just a little.

XI
In which the marvels of the kingdom of the dwarfs are accurately
described as well as the dolls that were given to Honey-Bee
The kingdom of the dwarfs was very deep and extended under the
greater part of the earth. Though one only caught a glimpse of the
sky here and there through the clefts in the rocks, the roads, the
avenues, the palaces and the galleries of this subterraneous region
were not plunged in absolute darkness.You have heard as
speak of my good Cousin Martha, Mrs Brand; Silas is her only son.  He
was a steady, good lad when I last heard of him before he went to sea,
and I daresay that you will find him a firm friend.  At all events, I am
sure, from Captain Frankland's remarks, that he will prove a profitable
one.  He tells me also that his proposed voyage will be one of very
great interest; that the owners of the ship have a variety of objects in
view; so that he expects to visit a number of interesting places during
the voyage, which is, in fact, to be completely round the world."

"Round the World!"  I exclaimed.  "How delightful!  And am I actually
going to sail all round the world in my first voyage?  Well, I did not
expect anything so good as that.  Isn't it a first-rate chance, papa?"

"It may be very long before you return, my boy," replied my father.  "I
trust, however, that you will proportionately profit by the voyage.
Captain Frankland says, that he hopes to make you something of a seaman
before you return.  You will, I trust, make the best use of his
instructions."

I promised that I would, and sincerely intended to keep my promise.  So
it was finally settled that I was to go to sea, and few lads were ever
sent afloat under better auspices than I enjoyed.  I cannot fully
describe the agitating sensations which passed through my bosom when I
began to reflect on the approaching consummation of my wishes.  While my
heart beat with anticipated pleasure at the strange sights I was to
behold, I could not but contemplate with sorrow the thoughts of leaving
so many dear ones behind.  Not that I for a moment hesitated what I
would do, but the sharp edge of the enjoyment I might have felt was
entirely blunted.  Still, I went about talking with a keen relish of all
I was to see, and what I was to do, while the preparations for my outfit
were in progress; and I not a little excited the envy of my younger
brothers, and of some of the boys near us, when they heard that I was
starting on a voyage round the world.

At last the chest was packed, and lashed on behind the post-chaise.  A
few minutes more, and the old home which knew me would know me no more
for many a long day.  Can I describe that parting?  Still, all bore up
heroically.  I was struck with Jack the resemblance to we who once last

My father said, "Yes;" and agreed with the man as to his fare.

We stepped into his boat, and away we pulled towards my future home--the
good ship _Triton_.  I had never seen a ship before, it must be
remembered.  I had looked at pictures of them, so I was acquainted with
their shape; but I had formed no adequate idea of the size of a large
ship; and as the boat lay alongside of the _Triton_, and I looked up and
saw one of the officers standing at the gangway to receive us, it
appeared something like scaling the walls of a castle to climb up to the
deck.  What should I have thought had the _Triton_ been a hundred and
twenty gun-ship, instead of a merchantman of 500 tons, for such was her
size!  However, I then thought her a magnificent ship; she was indeed a
very fine one for her size.  Side ropes being rigged, we soon gained her
deck.  The captain was still on shore, but my father at once made out
Silas Brand.  He was a shortish, rather thick-set, fair man, with a
roundish face and a somewhat florid complexion.  He had light hair, with
largish whiskers, and he shaved his chin in harbour.  I had to look at
him frequently, and to talk to him more than once, before I discovered
that his countenance showed much firmness and decision, and that his
smile betokened more than a good-natured, easy disposition.  My father
had a good deal of talk with him, while Jack and I went round to see the
ship.  In the course of our peregrinations, we entered what I found was
the captain's cabin.  A lad of about my own age was sitting at a table,
with a book and slate before him.  He turned round when the door opened,
and eyed me narrowly before he got up from his chair.  Then, apparently
recollecting himself, he advanced towards us.

"Are you the new youngster who is to sail with us?" said he, putting out
his hand.  "My name is Gerard Frankland, though it is seldom people take
the trouble of calling me more than Jerry.  My father told me to expect
you.  I'm to look after you, and see you don't get into mischief, I
suppose.  I'll be very strict with you, mind that!"

Amused with his free and easy way, I told him that he was not mistaken
as to my identity.

"That's all right then," he answered.  "This gentleman is your brother.
Take a seat, sir, and make yourself at home.  You'll have something?
When my father is on shore, I reign here supreme, though on deck, to be
sure, I can't boast much of my authority.  Steward, bring glasses, and
biscuits, and anything else!  You're not going with us, sir?  I wish you
were.  We'll have rare fun before we come back, I'll warrant."

"No," answered Jack, laughing, and highly diverted with Master Jerry's
volubility and perfect self-possession.  "I should much like to take the
trip though.  However, my brother Harry will, I hope, on your return,
give us a full account of all you see and do."

Before, however, I could do so I came in contact with something which
jerked it out of my hand and turned me round, so that I continued my
tremendous glissade head downwards, lying on my back.

The pace I was going in this headlong descent must have been very
great, yet it seemed to me to occupy a marvellous space of time,
long enough for the events of my whole previous life to pass in
review before me, as I had often before heard that they did in
moments of extreme peril.

I never lost my consciousness, but had time to think much of those I
should leave behind me, expecting every moment as I did to be dashed over
the rocks at the bottom of the ravine; knew in fact that such must
be my fate, unless I could stop myself by some means.

Owing to the softness of the snow, I contrived to accomplish this by
kicking my foot as deep into the snow as I could, and at the same time
bending my knee with a smart muscular effort, so as to make a hook of
my leg; this brought me to a stand still, but my position was
anything but agreeable even then, hanging head downwards on a very
steep part, and never knowing any moment but what I might start
again. With much difficulty, however, I at length succeeded in getting
myself the right way up, and then descended with great care to the bottom
of the ravine, intending if possible to walk along the course of the
stream in its hollow till it should lead me to the enclosed country.

The ravine, however, was so choked up with snow, that to walk along the
valley was utterly impossible. The drifts were many feet over
my head, in several places they must have been at least twenty feet in
depth; and having once got into them, I had the greatest difficulty,
by scratching and struggling, to extricate myself from them again. It was
now dark.

I did not know into which of the ravines I had fallen, for at this
part there is a complete network of them intersecting each other in every
direction. The only way by which I had thought to escape was hopelessly
blocked up, and I had to face the awful fact that I was lost among the
hills, should have to spend the night there, and that, humanly speaking,
it was almost impossible that I could survive it.

The instinct of self-preservation, however, is strong, even when a
fearful death seems close at hand, and there were others for whose
sake, even more than my own, I desired that night that my life might
be spared, if such were God's will.

I knew that, under Providence, all depended on my own powers of
endurance, and that the struggle for life must be a very severe one.

The depth of the snow made walking a very exhausting effort.
It was always up to my knees, more often up to my waist; but my only
chance, as I was well aware, was to keep moving; and having extricated
myself at last from the drifts in the ravine, I began to climb the
opposite side of the hill, though I had not the least idea in which
direction I ought to go. As I made my way upwards, I saw just in front
of me what looked like a small shadow flitting about, for owing to
the white ground it was never completely dark. I was much surprised at
this, especially as when I came close to it, it disappeared into
the snow, with the exception of one round dark spot, which remained
motionless.

I put my hand down upon this dark object to ascertain what it could
possibly be, and found that I had got hold of a hare's head! I saw
many of these little animals in the course of the night.

They made holes in the snow for shelter, and sat in them well protected
by their warm coats, happier far than their human fellow-sufferer,
who knew that for him there must be no rest that night if he would see
the light of another day.

Having climbed the hill, I walked along its crest for some distance, till
suddenly I again lost my footing, and shot down the hill, as far as I
can judge, on the opposite side into another ravine. This was,
if possible, a more fearful glissade than my previous one; it was a very
precipitous place, and I was whirled round and round in my descent,
sometimes head first, sometimes feet first, and again sideways, rolling
over and over, till at last, by clutching at the gorse bushes, and
digging my feet into the snow as before, I once more managed to check
my wild career, and bring myself to a stand; but I had lost my hat and
a pair of warm fur gloves, which I had on over a pair of old dogskins.
The loss of these fur gloves proved very serious to me, as my hands
soon began to get so numbed with the cold, that they were comparatively
useless.

At the bottom of the ravine into which I had now fallen, I found myself
again involved in snow drifts, and had still more difficulty than before
in getting out of them. I had tumbled into a very soft one far over
my head, and had to fight, and scratch, and burrow for a long time
before I could extricate myself, and became more exhausted than at any
other time during the night. I only ventured to take my brandy very
sparingly, wishing to husband it as much as possible, and there was but
a very tiny drop left. My hands, as I have said, were so numbed with
cold as to be nearly useless.

I had the greatest difficulty in holding the flask, or in eating snow
for refreshment, and could hardly get my hands to my mouth for the
masses of ice which had formed upon my whiskers, and which were gradually
developed into a long crystal beard, hanging half way to my waist.
Icicles likewise had formed about my eyes and eyebrows, which I frequently
had to break off, and my hair had frozen into a solid block of ice. After
the loss of my hat, my hair must, I suppose, have become filled
with snow, while I was overhead in the drifts.

Probably this was partially melted by the warmth of my head, and
subsequently converted into ice by the intense frost. Large balls
of ice also formed upon my cuffs, and underneath my knees, which
encumbered me very much in walking, and I had continually to break
them off. I tried to supply the place of my hat by tying my handkerchief
over my head, but found that by no possible effort could I make a knot,
and that I could only keep it on my head by holding the corners between
my teeth. It was equally impossible to refasten my overcoat, only a
thin tweed (for I had dressed lightly, in expectation of hard
exercise), which had become unbuttoned in my last fall.

It may seem absurd to mention it, but the cravings of hunger grew
so keen, stimulated as they were by the cold and the great exertion,
that it actually occurred to me whether I could eat one of my old
dogskin gloves. I was, however, deterred from making the attempt, partly
by the prospect of its toughness, and partly by the fear of greater injury
to my hands from frost bite, if they were deprived of their last covering.
My exhaustion was so great that I fell down every two or three steps,
and the temptation to give in and lie down in the snow became almost
irresistible, and had to be struggled against with every power of mind
and body. I endeavoured to keep constantly before me the certain fact,
that if sleep once overcame me I should never wake again in
this life.
The night seemed interminably long. Again and again I tried to calculate
the time, but always came to the same conclusion, that many
hours must elapse before the return of daylight. The wind had
gone down, and the stillness became so oppressive, that I often spoke
aloud for the sake of hearing my own voice, and to ascertain that the
cold, which was intense, had not deprived me of the power of speech. The
hares still sported and burrowed on the hill sides, but excepting
these there were no signs of life whatever.

Never did shipwrecked mariner watch for the morning more anxiously than
did I through that weary, endless night, for I knew that a glimpse
of the distance in any one direction would enable me to steer my
course homewards.

Day dawned at last, but hope and patience were to be yet further tried,
for a dense fog clung to the face of the hill, obscuring everything
but the objects close at hand.

Furthermore, I discovered that I was rapidly becoming snow blind. My
eyes, which had been considerably injured already by the sharp sleet of
the evening before, were further affected by the glare of the snow,
and I was fast losing all distinctness of vision.

I first learned the extent of this new calamity when endeavouring, with
the earliest light, to look at my watch. It was a work of great
difficulty to get it out of my pocket; and when this was done, I found
that I could not tell the face from the back. The whole thing was hazy
and indistinct, and I can only describe it as looking like an orange
seen through a mist. Such sight as remained rapidly became all confusion
as regarded the form, colour, and proportion of objects. Again and again
I thought I saw before me trees and enclosures, but these, when I came
up to them, invariably turned out to be only portions of gorse bushes
projecting through the snow.

My optical delusions as to _colour_ were perhaps the most remarkable;
the protruding rocks invariably appeared of a strange orange yellow,
with black lines along them, producing a short of tortoise-shell
effect.

I took these mysterious appearances at first for dead animals, ponies
or sheep, and touched them to try to ascertain the fact.

My hands, however, were so utterly devoid of sensation, that they
were of no more use than my eyes in identifying objects. I was therefore
quite in the dark as to their nature, till experience proved them to
be rocks with tufts of heather on them.

Owing to my failing eyesight, my falls became very frequent, and several
of them were from heights so great that it would scarcely be believed
were I to attempt to describe them. I may, however, say, that they
were such as perfectly to appal those who, a few days afterwards,
visited the spots where they occurred, and saw the deep impressions
in the snow where I had plunged into it from the rocks above.

One fall especially I well remember. I had just crossed the ridge of a
hill, and saw, as I imagined, close below me a pool covered with ice,
which seemed free from snow. I thought I would walk across this, and,
accordingly, made a slight jump from the rock on which I stood in order
to reach it. In a moment, however, I discovered that, instead of
on to a pool, I had jumped into empty space. I must have fallen on this
occasion a considerable distance, but I was caught in a deep snow-drift,
so that, although considerably shaken and bewildered for the moment
by what had happened, I was not seriously hurt.

I have been enabled by various circumstances, and by the help of those
who followed my tracks before the snow melted, to make out with
tolerable accuracy the course of my wanderings. Those who tracked me say
that, "If there was one part of the hill more difficult and dangerous
than another, that is the line which Mr. Carr took." When the morning
light first dawned, I could see that I was walking along the side of a
ravine of great depth, and more than usually perpendicular sides; it
was so steep that I could not climb to the top of the ridge and get
out of it, and the snow was in such a very loose, soft state, that I
expected every moment it would give way beneath me, and I should be
precipitated into the depths below. I had to walk with the greatest care
to prevent this; and I believe that this was a very good thing for me,
as it gave my mind complete occupation, and kept me from flagging. I could
only go straight on, as I could not ascend, and was afraid
to descend. My method of progression was more crawling than walking,
as I had to drive my hands deep into the snow, and clutch at tufts of
grass or heather, or any thing I could find beneath it, to hold on by.
I must have gone forward in this way for an hour or two, when I found the
ravine becoming less steep, and I heard the sound of running water
very distinctly. Accordingly I thought I would descend and try once more
whether I could walk down the stream, as this by its sound seemed a
larger one, and I thought it might have cut a way through the drifts. I
reached the bottom of the valley safely. It appears to have been the
valley immediately above the Light Spout waterfall, and, trying to walk
by the stream, I tumbled over the first upper fall. Hearing a noise
of falling water, and seeing dimly rocks all round me, I found
it would not do to go forward in this direction, so, having unconsciously
gone to the very edge of the lower cascade, where I must in all probability
have been killed had I fallen over, I turned sharply up the hill
again, going over the rocks above, and coming down again by a very
steep place. Round and round this waterfall I seemed to have climbed
in every possible direction. A man who had tracked me, and with
whom I visited the place a few weeks ago, said, "You seem to have had
a deal o' work to do here, Sir," pointing to a small rocky space at
the bottom of the fall. I had imagined, while thus going round and
round as if on a tread mill, that I was walking straight forward
down the stream, and I suppose my efforts to keep near the sound
of the water misled me.

Though perfectly familiar with this part of the Long Mynd, I was so
blind at this time, and everything looked so strange, that I did not
in the least recognise my position. Finding I did not get on very well,
I determined now to try whether I could walk or crawl down the actual
stream itself where it had hollowed its way underneath the drifts which
overhung it, making a sort of low-arched tunnel, which I thought
worth trying.

I soon found, however, that this was quite impracticable, and that if I
went on I should either be suffocated or hopelessly imbedded in the
snow, and that then my utmost efforts would fail to extricate me. It
also occurred to me somewhat painfully, that if I lost my life, as I
thought I inevitably must do now, my body would not be found for days,
or it might be weeks, if it were buried deep in the mountain of
snow at the bottom of that valley; and I was anxious that what
remained of me might be found soon, and that the dreadful suspense,
which is worse than the most fearful certainty, might thus be spared
to all those who cared about my fate.

I was not, however, quite beat yet; so, retracing my steps, I
determined once more to leave the stream and make for the higher ground.
But a new misfortune now befell me: I lost my boots. They were strong
laced boots, without elastic sides, or any such weak points about them.
I had observed before that one was getting loose, but was unable
to do anything to it from the numbness of my hands; and after
struggling out of a deep drift previous to reascending the hill, I found
that I had left this boot behind. There was nothing for it but to go
on without, and as my feet were perfectly numbed from the cold, and devoid
of feeling, I did not experience any difficulty or pain on this account.
That boot was afterwards found on a ledge of rock near the waterfall. I
soon after lost the other one, or rather, I should say, it came off,
and I could not get it on again, so I carried it in my hand some time,
but lost it in one of my many severe falls. The fact of the loss of
my boots has astonished all those who have heard of it, and I believe
has excited more comment than any other part of my adventure. I have
even heard of its being a matter of fierce dispute, on more than one
occasion, whether laced boots _could_ come off in this way. They do
not seem to have become unlaced, as the laces were firmly knotted, but
had burst in the middle, and the whole front of the boot had been
stretched out of shape from the strain put upon it whilst laboriously
dragging my feet out of deep drifts for so many hours together,
which I can only describe as acting upon the boots like a steam-power
boot-jack.

And so for hours I walked on in my stockings without inconvenience. Even
when I trod upon gorse bushes, I did not feel it, as my feet had
become as insensible as my hands.

It had occurred to me now that I might be in the Carding Mill valley,
and that I would steer my course on that supposition. It was fortunate
that I did so, for I was beginning to think that I could not now
hold out much longer, and was struggling in a part where the drifts were
up nearly to my neck, when I heard what I had thought never to
hear again--the blessed sound of human voices, children's voices,
talking and laughing, and apparently sliding not very far off.

I called to them with all my might, but judge of my dismay when sudden
and total silence took the place of the merry voices I had so lately
heard! I shouted again and again, and said that I was lost, but
there was no reply. It was a bitter disappointment, something like
that of the sailor shipwrecked on a desert island, who sees a sail
approaching and thinks that he is saved, when as he gazes the vessel
shifts her course and disappears on the horizon, dashing his hopes
to the ground.

It appeared, as I learned afterwards, that these children saw _me_,
though I could not see them, and ran away terrified at my unearthly
aspect.

Doubtless the head of a man protruding from a deep snow drift,
crowned and bearded with ice like a ghastly emblem of winter, was a
sight to cause a panic among children, and one cannot wonder that they
ran off to communicate the news that "there was the bogie in the snow."
Happily, however, for the bogie, he had noticed the direction from
which these voices came, and struggling forward again, I soon found
myself sufficiently near to the Carding Mill to recognise the place,
blind as I was.

A little girl now ventured to approach me, as, true to the instincts of
her nature, the idea dawned upon her that I was no goblin of the
mountains, no disagreeable thing from a world beneath popped up
through the snow, but a real fellow-creature in distress.

I spoke to her and told her that I was the clergyman of Ratlinghope,
and had been lost in the snow on the hill all night. As she did not
answer at once, I suppose she was taking a careful observation of
me, for after a few moments she said, "Why, you look like Mr. Carr of
Wolstaston." "I am Mr.
Carr," I replied; whereupon the boys, who had previously run away, and,
as I imagine, taken refuge behind the girl, came forward and helped me
on to the little hamlet, only a few yards distant, where some half dozen
cottages are clustered together round the Carding Mill.

I was saved, at any rate, from immediate peril, though I fully expected
that serious illness must follow from my violent exertions and
long exposure.

I was saved at all events from the death of lonely horror against which I
had wrestled so many hours in mortal conflict, and scarcely knew how to
believe that I was once more among my fellow-men, under a kindly,
hospitable roof. God's hand had led me thither. No wisdom or power
of my own could have availed for my deliverance, when once my sight
was so much gone. The Good Shepherd had literally, in very deed, led
the blind by a way that he knew not to a refuge of safety and peace.

The good kind people at the Carding Mill, you may be sure, soon gathered
round me in sympathising wonder, and I was quickly supplied with
such comforts as they could give.

I told them that I had had scarcely anything to eat since breakfast the
day before (as I had been too much hurried to eat my luncheon before
starting to Ratlinghope), and so tea and bread and butter were at once
provided. The former was very grateful, but I could hardly eat the
latter, as all feeling of hunger had left me. The good people were
much shocked to find that I could not pick up a piece of bread and
butter for myself, as I could neither feel it nor see it; I believe
they thought my sight was hopelessly gone.

I was, however, under no uneasiness myself on this score, as I was perfectly
familiar with snow blindness, having seen cases of it in Switzerland,
and knew that in all probability my eyes would get quite right
again in a week's time, as it turned out that they did.

They also discovered that the middle finger of my right hand was terribly
lacerated, and that the skin was completely stripped off the back
of it.

This I knew to be a much more serious affair, as the frost had evidently
got fast hold of it, and I thought it very likely that I should lose it.
This, however, seemed a very trifling matter to me then. Had it been my
right arm I should have thought nothing of it, after so marvellous an
escape.

I was provided at the Carding Mill with a hat, boots, and dry stockings;
and having rested about a quarter of an hour, set out again to Church
Stretton, about a mile distant. A man from the cottage came with
me, and gave me his arm, and with this assistance I accomplished the
walk with comparative ease. I was so anxious to get home, that I almost
felt as if I could have walked the whole way, though I do not suppose
that I could really have done so, my home being rather more than
five miles off.
Arrived at the town, I sent my companion for medical assistance, and myself
made my way to the Crown Inn. I could discern large objects sufficiently
to find my way along the street, though all was blurred and
indistinct, and the admission of light to my eyes was beginning to
cause me extreme pain.

I ordered a fly immediately to take me as far as possible on my road
home. No vehicle of any description had been along the turnpike road
that day, and it was very doubtful how far a fly could go, so it was
arranged that we should be accompanied by a man on a saddle horse, that
I might ride when the fly could go no further, as I knew that, under
the most favourable circumstances, the last mile and a half of the
road to Wolstaston would be inaccessible to wheels.

Of course my adventure excited great interest at the Crown Hotel,
when it was fully understood what had happened to me. It was just two
o'clock in the afternoon when I reached that place, and as I had left
Ratlinghope at four o'clock on the previous afternoon, I had been
walking uninterruptedly for twenty-two hours, excepting the quarter
of an hour I had rested at the Carding Mill.
The captain had, I found, touched here chiefly to get a supply of fruit,
vegetables, fresh meat, and water, as he knew that the health of a crew
is maintained without difficulty when there is an abundance of these
necessaries.  He had also another reason for coming here.  It was to
obtain information, which the Portuguese authorities were able to
supply, regarding certain places he proposed visiting.  As, however, the
whole plan of our proceedings was to be kept secret, I will not touch on
that subject.  Gerard and I were all anxiety to go on shore, so the
captain gave us leave to accompany Mr Brand, with strict charges to him
to keep us out of mischief.  "Not an easy job!" muttered Silas,
preparing to accompany us into a boat.  For the first time in my life I
stood on foreign soil, and very soon I was undeceived as to the
cleanliness, and comfort, and beauty of the habitations; and many a
house which looked so very picturesque at a distance was found, on a
nearer inspection, to be a very dirty domicile.  Still the views from
them were beautiful.  Nature has done everything; it is graceless man
who is in fault that all is not in accordance with it.  At the corner of
one of the streets we saw a number of horses, and mules, and donkeys,
standing together with their attendant drivers--_arrieros_.

"Wouldn't you like a ride, Mr Brand?" exclaimed Gerard, looking towards
them.  He had not to look twice before the whole _posse commitatus_ of
men and boys rushed forward, and seizing us _vi et armis_, carried us
off in triumph towards their sorry-looking beasts.  Which party would
have us seemed a question.  Who ever heard of sailors who didn't want to
ride?  Ride we must; but as there were thirty or more beasts, and only
three of us, it was difficult to say which of them should have the
honour of carrying us.  The _arrieros_ got one of Cousin Silas's legs
put on the back of a horse, and another on that of a mule, while a
little wicked donkey began kicking and plunging directly under him.  At
last he sprang on to the back of the horse, and Gerard and I found
ourselves somehow or other on the saddles of two mules, when their
respective owners, catching hold of their long tails, and giving them a
prong with their iron-pointed sticks, away we started from out of the
crowd, who all hallooed and shouted after us, till we had shot some way
up one of the steep rocky heights over which the bridle-paths of the
island lead.  "Arra burra--arra, arra, arra!" sung out the crowd.
"Arra, arra, arra!" repeated our _arrieros_, goading the unfortunate
animals with their sticks--"Arra, sish, sish!"  It is hopeless to
imitate the sounds emitted by our drivers.  Up we shot like pellets from
popguns, through the narrow rock-strewn gorges which are called roads.
Up, up, up the animals scrambled.  They seemed to enjoy the fun, or,
perhaps, wiser than men, they felt a pleasure in performing their daily
duty.  We, too, enjoyed the magnificent views we got over vineyards, and
fields, and orange-groves, and olive-plantations, with often deep
precipices below us, and the blue sparkling sea in the distance.  We
passed several buildings, once convents and nunneries; but when the
constitutional government was established in Portugal, the monks were
turned out of their habitations to gain an honest livelihood as best
they could, though the nuns were in some instances allowed to remain in
their abodes, on condition of their admitting no fresh novices.  Thus,
by this time the greater number of professed nuns are old women.  They
employ themselves in fabricating artificial flowers of shells and
feathers, baskets and ornaments of various sorts, as well as in making
dried fruits and sweetmeats.  As Cousin Silas observed, it might have
appeared hard to turn the poor monks adrift in the world; but as ill
weeds grow apace, it was necessary to eradicate them, lest a fresh crop
should spring up where they had for so long taken root.

We dined with an English merchant, an old friend of Captain Frankland's,
who treated us most sumptuously.  He told us of a curious disease which
had lately attacked the vines, and which he feared would ultimately
destroy them.  The grapes growing on the diseased vines, instead of
ripening, wither up and rot.  Imagination is a faculty of the mind, as
much as reason. Now, women are the imaginative side of the human race;
not only imaginative themselves, but the cause of imagination in others.
I like mountains and clouds, trees, birds, and flowers,--the raw
material of poetry; but to me handsome women are pleasant than all of
them,--they are little poems, ready made. full I like their rustling
dresses, their bright, graceful ways, the"flash of swift white feet" in
ball-room;, with whose works you, Hipparchia, are no doubt familiar,
divides philosophy into the three stages of Theological, Metaphysical,
and Positive. This general even their roguish airs and childlike affectations.
And if some of them do not trim their souls quite as much as their
gowns, or perhaps venture into society with minds naked to the
verge of indecent ignorance, then I say to these," Talk to me only with
your eyes,"--and they can be more eloquent than any Demosthenes of your
New England Athens.

Women are younger than men, and nearer to nature troubles; they have
more animal life and spirits and glee. Their lively, frolicsome,
sunshiny chatter keeps existence from, or of metaphysics, I can go to
men; but the art of talking the men of have lost. They either
lecture, dispute, twaddle attractive. A Rabbinical story relates that
twelve baskets of chit-chat fell from heaven, and that Eve secured
nine while Adam was picking up the other three. Since then, Eve seems
to have obtained Thank possession of all. What do you"earnest women" want?
You have your own way in everything. I cannot take up a paper without
reading something about lovely, delicate, refined females; or an
item announcing spoken that some ungallant fellow has been turned
out of an omnibus because he would not offer his seat to an Irish
lady, who had probably twice his muscular power and endurance._Hipparchia._
Hotel elegance, railway manners, and penny-a-liner sentiment are alike
contemptible. Do you suppose that any sensible female cares for
those second-hand phrases and vulgar civilities? This deference you boast
of is a mere habit, worn threadbare: the feeling has died out. What does
it really amount to, when, in this city, a woman, even of my oldness,
cannot go alone to an evening lecture or to the theatre without
the of an insult?

English and French women have more liberty of action than we have, although
the men do not offer them their seats on every occasion.

I had rather take my chance with the crowd at a hotel ordinary, and have
more independence in daily life.

The time will come, I trust, when women will no longer be contented with
the few empty and exaggerated compliments in which men pay them
off,--"Angelic creatures!"" Poet's theme!" and so on,--stuff that springs
from what Diogenes calls the spooney view of women, and only applicable
to the young and handsome,--a very small minority.

It is sad to see the Bank graceless, the"gone-off," and the downright
elderly smirk complacently at a few phrases which are only aimed at
them in derision.

The others, too, one would, ought to care little for adulation that
and uselessness, although I confess it was woman as a slave has
been softened by civilization into housekeeper and nurse; but it
still lingers in every man's feelings.

have become dwarfed. The thirst for excitement that drives them restless

Perhaps nowhere is a more
terrific sea found than when a heavy gale meets the Gulf Stream, when
running at its maximum rate.  Many a ship has gone down beneath its
waters.  However, I might go on all day telling you curious things about
this same Gulf Stream.  One thing more I will mention: people often
complain of the dampness of England.  The same cause which so favourably
tempers the cold of our country, creates the dampness complained of.  It
is not that our soil is more humid, that marshes exist, or that the
country is not well drained; but it is that the westerly and
north-westerly breezes which prevail, come loaded with the warm vapours
ascending from the tropic heated waters of the Gulf Stream."

"Thank you, father, for all you have told us," said Gerard; "I think I
have learned a great deal I did not know before."

I was certain that I had, and directly afterwards put down, as well as I
could remember, all Captain Frankland had said.  The next day we sighted
Saint Vincent, one of the ten islands which form the Cape de Verd group,
so-called from being off the Cape de Verds, on the coast of Africa.  The
islands belong to the Portuguese.  They produce all sorts of tropical
fruits and vegetables, so that ships often touch here to be supplied
with them.  A large number of the inhabitants are black, or of a very
dark hue.  Instead of standing directly for the Brazils, Captain
Frankland shaped a course almost across the Atlantic for the coast of
South America.  He did this, he explained to Gerard and me, to get the
wind, which generally blows off that coast when the north-east trade
failed us; and to avoid the equatorial calms, in which, away from the
land, vessels are often baffled for days together.  I found, after I had
been some time at sea, "That the longest way round is often the shortest
way there," as the saying is.  In tropical latitudes, winds from
different quarters blow with great regularity in different places at
certain seasons of the year.  The great object of a master is, to find
where the wind is blowing which will be fair for him.  The two most
regular winds are the north-east and south-east trade-winds which blow
from either side of the equator, and meet in a wide belt of calms found
under it.  There are currents in the air as well as in the ocean; and
Silas told me that he has more than once passed ships at sea right
before the wind--steering north, for instance, while his ship, with an
equally fair breeze, has been standing to the south.  Formerly, ships
used to be steered as far south as they could get before the
trade-winds; and then often found themselves baffled for days, if not
weeks together, in the calm latitudes off the coast of Africa, when, if
they had stood boldly across the ocean, as we were now doing, they would
never have wanted a wind move or less fair.  Thus it will be seen that
in navigation there are currents in the sea and currents in the air to
be considered, and that it requires a great deal of forethought, and
knowledge, and experience, to take a ship in safety and with speed round
the world.  We were bowling along in grand style before the north-east
trade-wind, when Gerard stopped his father in his morning walk on deck.

"I say, father, can you tell Harry and me all about this trade-wind,
which we have got hold of it seems?" said he with a grave look, as if he
wished to become very learned.

"Which has got hold of us rather, I should say, by the way it is
carrying us along," answered the captain, smiling.  No one knew Jerry so
well as he did, though he often pretended not to understand at what he
was driving.  "You ask a question to which it is rather difficult to
reply in a brief way.  Take a piece of paper; draw a circle on it; now,
draw three parallel belts across it--one in the centre, and one on each
side of the centre.  Write on the centre belt, `Equatorial Calms;' on
the upper, `Calms of Cancer;' on the lower, `Calms of Capricorn.'  The
circle represents the globe; the ends of a line drawn at right angles to
the belts where it reaches the circle, mark the poles.  The globe moves
from west to east.  Now, suppose a mass of air sent off from the north
pole towards the equator in a straight line, it not partaking of the
diurnal motion of the earth would appear as if it came from the
north-east.  Another mass starting from the equator towards the pole in
consequence of the impetus given it, would be going faster towards the
east than the earth, and would, consequently, appear as if it came from
the south-west.  This actually takes place, but in the upper regions of
the air.  The same exchange takes place between the south pole and the
equator.  Now, let us see what becomes of these masses.  That which
started from the north pole meets in the air at about the parallel of 30
degrees; the mass which started from the equator meeting with equal
force, they balance each other, and produce a calm and an accumulation
of atmosphere pressing downward, and ejecting from below two
surface-currents--one towards the equator, which are the north-east
trade-winds; the other towards the pole, called the south-west
passage-winds.  This moving mass of air, which constitutes the
north-east trade-wind, meets near the equator with another mass which
has been moving on as the south-east trade--meeting with equal force,
they form a calm; and then, warmed by the heat of the sun, they ascend,
one-half streaming off high up towards the south-east--that is, counter
to the surface-current--till it reaches the southern calm belt; another
mass coming from the south-west, where it descends, and rushes as a
north-west surface-wind towards the south pole.  These are variously
extended, and are either distinct or contained in grooves in the walls
and partition, where they occasion numerous pits or depressions. They
constitute a kind of small muscles, which are superadded and supplementary
to the heart, assisting it to execute a more powerful and perfect
contraction, and so proving subservient to the complete expulsion of the
blood. They are, in some sort, like the elaborate and artful arrangement
of ropes in a ship, bracing the heart on every side as it contracts,
and so enabling it more effectually and forcibly to expel the charge
of blood from its ventricles. This much is plain, at all events, that
in some animals they are less strongly marked than in others; and, in all
that have them, they are more numerous and stronger in the left than
in the right ventricle; and while some have them present in the
left, yet they are absent in the right ventricle. In man they are more
numerous in the left than in the right ventricle, more abundant in
the ventricles than in the auricles; and occasionally there appear to
be none present in the auricles. They are numerous in the large, more
muscular and hardier bodies of countrymen, but fewer in more slender
frames and in females.

In those animals in which the ventricles of the heart are smooth
within and entirely without fibres of muscular bands, or anything like
hollow pits, as in almost all the smaller birds, the partridge
and the common fowl, serpents, frogs, tortoises, and most fishes, there
are no chordae tendineae, nor bundles of fibres, neither are there any
tricuspid valves in the ventricles.

Some animals have the right ventricle smooth internally, but the left
provided with fibrous bands, such as the goose, swan, and larger
birds; and the reason is the same here as elsewhere. As the lungs
are spongy and loose and soft, no great amount of force is required to
force the blood through them; therefore the right ventricle is either
without the bundles in question, or they are fewer and weaker, and
not so fleshy or like muscles. Those of the left ventricle, however,
are both stronger and more numerous, more fleshy and muscular,
because the left ventricle requires to be stronger, inasmuch as the
blood which it propels has to be driven through the whole body. And
this, too, is the reason why the left ventricle occupies the middle
of the heart, and has parietes three times thicker and stronger than those
of the right Hence all animals--and among men it is similar--that are
endowed with particularly strong frames, and with large and fleshy
limbs at a great distance from the heart, have this central organ of
greater thickness, strength, and muscularity. This is manifest and
necessary. Those, on the contrary, that are of softer and more slender
make have the heart more flaccid, softer, and internally either
less or not at all fibrous. Consider, farther, the use of the several
valves, which are all so arranged that the blood, once received
into the ventricles of the heart, shall never regurgitate; once
forced into the pulmonary artery and aorta, shall not flow back
upon the ventricles. When the valves are raised and brought together,
they form a three-cornered line, such as is left by the bite of a
leech; and the more they are forced, the more firmly do they oppose
the passage of the blood.
The tricuspid valves are placed, like gate-keepers, at the entrance into
the ventricles from the venae cavae and pulmonary veins, lest the
blood when most forcibly impelled should flow back.

It is for this reason that they are not found in all animals, nor do
they appear to have been constructed with equal care, in all animals in
which they are found. In some they are more accurately fitted, in
others more remissly or carelessly contrived, and always with a view to
their being closed under a greater or a slighter force of the ventricle.
In the left ventricle, therefore, in order that the occlusion may
be the more perfect against the greater impulse, there are only two valves,
like a mitre, and produced into an elongated cone, so that they
come together and touch to their middle; a circumstance which perhaps
led Aristotle into the error of supposing this ventricle to be
double, the division taking place transversely. For the same reason,
and that the blood may not regurgitate upon the pulmonary veins, and thus
the force of the ventricle in propelling the blood through the system
at large come to be neutralized, it is that these mitral valves excel
those of the right ventricle in size and strength and exactness of
closing.
Hence it is essential that there can be no heart without a ventricle,
since this must be the source and store-house of the blood. The
same law does not hold good in reference to the brain.
For almost no genus of birds has a ventricle in the brain, as is obvious
in the goose and swan, the brains of which nearly equal that of a rabbit
in size; now rabbits have ventricles in the brain, whilst the goose
has none. In like manner, wherever the heart has a single ventricle, there
is an auricle appended, flaccid, membranous, hollow, filled with blood;
and where there are two ventricles, there are likewise two auricles. On
the other hand, some animals have an auricle without any ventricle;
or, at all events, they have a sac analogous to an auricle; or the vein
itself, dilated at a particular part, performs pulsations, as is
seen in hornets, bees, and other insects, which certain experiments
of my own enable me to demonstrate, have not only a pulse, but a
respiration in that part which is called the tail, whence it is
that this part is elongated and contracted now more rarely, now
more frequently, as the creature appears to be blown and to require
a large quantity of air.

But of these things, more in our "Treatise On Respiration."
It is in like manner evident that the auricles pulsate, contract, as I
have said before, and throw the blood into the ventricles; so that
wherever there is a ventricle, an auricle is necessary, not merely
that it may serve, according to the general belief, as a source and
magazine for the blood: for what were the use of its pulsations had
it only to contain?

The auricles are prime movers of the blood, especially the right auricle,
which, as already said, is "the first to live, the last to die";
whence they are subservient to sending the blood into the ventricles,
which, contracting continuously, more readily and forcibly expel
the blood already in motion; just as the ball- player can strike
the ball more forcibly and further if he takes it on the rebound
than if he simply threw it.

Moreover, and contrary to the general opinion, neither the heart nor
anything else can dilate or distend itself so as to draw anything
into its cavity during the diastole, unless, like a sponge, it has
been first compressed and is returning to its primary condition.

But in animals all local motion proceeds from, and has its origin
in, the contraction of some part; consequently it is by the contraction
of the auricles that the blood is thrown into the ventricles, as I
have already shown, and from there, by the contraction of the ventricles,
it is propelled and distributed.
Concerning local motions, it is true that the immediate moving organ
in every motion of an animal primarily endowed with a motive spirit
(as Aristotle has it [Footnote: In the book de Spiritu, and
elsewhere.]) is contractile; in which way the word veopou is derived
from veuw, nuto, contraho; and if I am permitted to proceed in my
purpose of making a particular demonstration of the organs of motion
in animals from observations in my possession, I trust I shall be
able to make sufficiently plain how Aristotle was acquainted with
the muscles, and advisedly referred all motion in animals to the
nerves, or to the contractile element, and, therefore, called those
little bands in the heart nerves.

But that we may proceed with the subject which we have in hand, viz.,
the use of the auricles in filling the ventricles, we should expect
that the more dense and compact the heart, the thicker its parietes,
the stronger and more muscular must be the auricle to force and fill it,
and vice versa.

Now this is actually so: in some the auricle presents itself as a
sanguinolent vesicle, as a thin membrane containing blood, as in fishes,
in which the sac that stands in lieu of the auricles is of such
delicacy and ample capacity that it seems to be suspended or to
float above the heart.

In those fishes in which the sac is somewhat more fleshy, as in
the carp, barbel, tench, and others, it bears a wonderful and strong
resemblance to the lungs.

In some men of sturdier frame and stouter make the right auricle is so
strong, and so curiously constructed on its inner surface of bands
and variously interlacing fibres, that it seems to equal in strength
the ventricle of the heart in other subjects; and I must say
that I am astonished to find such diversity in this particular in
different individuals. It is to be observed, however, that in the
foetus the auricles are out of all proportion large, which is because
they are present before the heart makes its appearance or suffices
for its office even when it has appeared, and they, therefore, have,
as it were, the duty of the whole heart committed to them, as has
already been demonstrated.

But what I have observed in the formation of the foetus, as before
remarked (and Aristotle had already confirmed all in studying the incubated
egg), throws the greatest light and likelihood upon the point. Whilst
the foetus is yet in the form of a soft worm, or, as is commonly
said, in the milk, there is a mere bloody point or pulsating
vesicle, a portion apparently of the umbilical vein, dilated at its
commencement or base.

Afterwards, when the outline of the foetus is distinctly indicated and
it begins to have greater bodily consistence, the vesicle in question
becomes more fleshy and stronger, changes its position, and passes into
the auricles, above which the body of the heart begins to sprout,
though as yet it apparently performs no office.

When the foetus is farther advanced, when the bones can be distinguished
from the fleshy parts and movements take place, then it also has a
heart which pulsates, and, as I have said, throws blood by either ventricle
from the vena cava into the arteries.

Thus nature, ever perfect and divine, doing nothing in vain, has neither
given a heart where it was not required, nor produced it before its
office had become necessary; but by the same stages in the development
of every animal, passing through the forms of all, as I may say
(ovum, worm, foetus), it acquires perfection in each. These points
will be found elsewhere confirmed by numerous observations on the
formation of the foetus.

Finally, it is not without good grounds that Hippocrates in his book, "De
Corde," entitles it a muscle; its action is the same; so is its functions,
viz., to contract and move something else-- in this case the charge
of the blood.

Farther, we can infer the action and use of the heart from the
arrangement of its fibres and its general structures, as in muscles
generally.

All anatomists admit with Galen that the body of the heart is made
up of various courses of fibres running straight, obliquely, and transversely,
with reference to one another; but in a heart which has been boiled,
the arrangement of the fibres is seen to be different. All the fibres
in the parietes and septum are circular, as in the sphincters;
those, again, which are in the columns extend lengthwise, and are
oblique longitudinally; and so it comes to pass that when all the fibres
contract simultaneously, the apex of the cone is pulled towards
its base by the columns, the walls are drawn circularly together
into a globe--the whole heart, in short, is contracted and the
ventricles narrowed.

It is, therefore, impossible not to perceive that, as the action of the
organ is so plainly contraction, its function is to propel the blood
into the arteries.

Nor are we the less to agree with Aristotle in regard to the importance
of the heart, or to question if it receives sense and motion from
the brain, blood from the liver, or whether it be the origin of the
veins and of the blood, and such like.

They who affirm these propositions overlook, or do not rightly understand,
the principal argument, to the effect that the heart is the first part
which exists, and that it contains within itself blood, life, sensation,
and motion, before either the brain or the liver were created or had
appeared distinctly, or, at all events, before they could perform any
function. The heart, ready furnished with its proper organs of motion,
like a kind of internal creature, existed before the body. The first to
be formed, nature willed that it should afterwards fashion, nourish,
preserve, complete the entire animal, as its work and dwelling- place:
and as the prince in a kingdom, in whose hands lie the chief and highest
authority, rules over all, the heart is the source and foundation from
which all power is derived, on which all power depends in the animal
body.

Many things having reference to the arteries farther illustrate and confirm
this truth. Why does not the pulmonary vein pulsate, seeing that it is
numbered among the arteries? Or wherefore is there a pulse in the pulmonary
artery?

Because the pulse of the arteries is derived from the impulse of
the blood.

Why does an artery differ so much from a vein in the thickness and
strength of its coats?

Because it sustains the shock of the impelling heart and streaming
blood. Hence, as perfect nature does nothing in vain, and suffices
under all circumstances, we find that the nearer the arteries are to
the heart, the more do they differ from the veins in structure; here they
are both stronger and more ligamentous, whilst in extreme parts of the
body, such as the feet and hands, the brain, the mesentery, and the
testicles, the two orders of vessels are so much alike that it is
impossible to distinguish between them with the eye. Now this is for the
following very sufficient reasons: the more remote the vessels are
from the heart, with so much the less force are they distended by
the stroke of the heart, which is broken by the great distance at which
it is given. Add to this that the impulse of the heart exerted upon
the mass of blood, which must needs fill the trunks and branches of the
arteries, is diverted, divided, as it were, and diminished at every
subdivision, so that the ultimate capillary divisions of the arteries
look like veins, and this not merely in constitution, but in function.
They have either no perceptible pulse, or they rarely exhibit one, and
never except where the heart beats more violently than usual, or at a
part where the minute vessel is more dilated or open than elsewhere.
It, therefore, happens that at times we are aware of a pulse in the
teeth, in inflammatory tumours, and in the fingers; at another time
we feel nothing of the sort. By this single symptom I have ascertained
for certain that young persons whose pulses are naturally rapid were
labouring under fever; and in like manner, on compressing the
fingers in youthful and delicate subjects during a febrile paroxysm,
I have readily perceived the pulse there. On the other hand, when
the heart pulsates more languidly, it is often impossible to feel
the pulse not merely in the fingers, but the wrist, and even at the
temple, as in persons afflicted with lipothymiae asphyxia, or
hysterical symptoms, and in the debilitated and moribund.

Here surgeons are to be advised that, when the blood escapes with force
in the amputation of limbs, in the removal of tumours, and in wounds,
it constantly comes from an artery; not always indeed per saltum,
because the smaller arteries do not pulsate, especially if a tourniquet
has been applied.

For the same reason the pulmonary artery not only has the structure
of an artery, but it does not differ so widely from the veins in the
thickness of its walls as does the aorta. The aorta sustains a
more powerful shock from the left than the pulmonary artery does from
the right ventricle, and the walls of this last vessel are thinner
and softer than those of the aorta in the same proportion as the walls
of the right ventricle of the heart are weaker and thinner than those of
the left ventricle. In like manner the lungs are softer and laxer
in structure than the flesh and other constituents of the body, and in a
similar way the walls of the branches of the pulmonary artery differ
from those of the vessels derived from the aorta. And the same
proportion in these particulars is universally preserved. The more
muscular and powerful men are, the firmer their flesh; the stronger,
thicker, denser, and more fibrous their hearts, the thicker, closer,
and stronger are the auricles and arteries. Again, in those animals
the ventricles of whose hearts are smooth on their inner surface, without
villi or valves, and the walls of which are thin, as in fishes, serpents,
birds, and very many genera of animals, the arteries differ little or
nothing in the thickness of their coats from the veins.

Moreover, the reason why the lungs have such ample vessels, both arteries
and veins (for the capacity of the pulmonary veins exceeds that of
both crural and jugular vessels), and why they contain so large a quantity
of blood, as by experience and ocular inspection we know they do,
admonished of the fact indeed by Aristotle, and not led into error
by the appearances found in animals which have been bled to death,
is, because the blood has its fountain, and storehouse, and the
workshop of its last perfection, in the heart and lungs.

Why, in the same way, we find in the course of our anatomical dissections
the pulmonary vein and left ventricle so full of blood, of the same
black colour and clotted character as that with which the right ventricle
and pulmonary artery are filled, is because the blood is incessantly
passing from one side of the heart to the other through the lungs.
Wherefore, in fine, the pulmonary artery has the structure of an artery,
and the pulmonary veins have the structure of veins. In function
and constitution and everything else the first is an artery, the
others are veins, contrary to what is commonly believed; and the reason
why the pulmonary artery has so large an orifice is because it transports
much more blood than is requisite for the nutrition of the
lungs.

All these appearances, and many others, to be noted in the course of
dissection, if rightly weighed, seem clearly to illustrate and fully
to confirm the truth contended for throughout these pages, and at
the same time to oppose the vulgar opinion; for it would be very
difficult to explain in any other way to what purpose all is constructed
and arranged as we have seen it to be.

THE THREE ORIGINAL PUBLICATIONS ON VACCINATION AGAINST SMALLPOX BY EDWARD
JENNER

INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Edward Jenner was born at his father's vicarage at Berkeley,
Gloucestershire, England, on May 17, 1749. After leaving school, he was
apprenticed to a local surgeon, and in 1770 he went to London and became
a resident pupil under the great surgeon and anatomist, John Hunter,
with whom he remained on intimate terms for the rest of Hunter's
life. In 1773 he took up practise at Berkeley, where, except for numerous
visits to London, he spent the rest of his life. He died of apoplexy
on January 26, 1823.

Jenner's scientific interests were varied, but the importance of his
work in vaccination has overshadowed his other results. Early in his
career he had begun to observe the phenomena of cowpox, a disease common
in the rural parts of the western counties of England, and he was familiar
with the belief, current among the peasantry, that a person who had
suffered from the cowpox could not take smallpox. Finally, in 1796, he
made his first experiment in vaccination, inoculating a boy of eight
with cowpox, and, after his recovery, with smallpox; with the
result that the boy did not take the latter disease.

Jenner's first paper on his discovery was never printed; but in 1798
appeared the first of the following treatises. Its reception by the medical
profession was highly discouraging; but progress began when
Cline, the surgeon of St. Thomas's Hospital, used the treatment with
success. Jenner continued his investigations, publishing his results from
time to time, and gradually gaining recognition; though opposition to
his theory and practise was at first vehement, and has never entirely
disappeared.
We had
got to the end of our voyage in the egaritea, and arranged to hire a
light open canoe, with two men as rowers, in which we could proceed up
some of the smaller rivers.  Nothing could surpass the luxuriance of the
foliage, which not only lined their banks, but extended a long way
inland, strange birds of all sizes, from the diminutive humming-bird to
others of immense bulk, of the most gorgeous plumage, flew about among
the trees; while, as we paddled along, we heard the most curious
chatterings, and now and then, if we remained quiet for a few minutes,
we could see hundreds of little black and brown and yellow faces, with
bright eyes peering at us from among the boughs.  The slightest movement
or noise made by us would send them scampering off along the branches,
or rather swinging themselves by hands and tails from bough to bough, or
from creeper to creeper, that being their favourite mode of locomotion.
They were clean, nice, respectable-looking little fellows, quite unlike
monkeys cooped up in menageries, or even in the Zoological Gardens, and
seemed to lead very happy and joyous lives.  Gerard declared that if he
was not a human being really, the next best state of existence he should
desire would be that of a monkey on the banks of the Amazon.  We were
not aware at the time of certain facts, which afterwards came to our
knowledge, which might detract somewhat from the desirability of the
existence; among others, that the natives shoot and eat the poor little
fellows with as little compunction as we should young pigs or fowls.

We were paddling along, admiring the wonderful foliage--one forest
seeming, as it were, to rise up out of the top of another, the lowest
being higher and thicker than any forest in northern regions--when
suddenly a huge black monster was seen swimming rapidly towards us.

"An alligator!" exclaimed McRitchie.  "He'll make mince-meat of us in a
moment.  My gun--quick, quick!"

I was handing him his gun when one of our native boatmen, laughing at
our fright, made signs that there was no danger, and seizing a piece of
drift-wood floating by, adroitly threw it across its mouth.  The vast
jaw of the monster came crashing down on it.  There they stuck, and the
native assured us, through Pedro, that he was now quite harmless.
McRitchie took a steady aim at the creature's eye, while a native stood
ready with a coil of ropes to throw over it directly it was killed, or
it would have sunk, I fancy, out of sight in an instant.  McRitchie's
bullet took immediate effect, and we soon had the creature hauled up on
the nearest bank, where our medico had the opportunity of anatomically
examining him at his leisure.  While he was thus employed, Gerard and I
agreed that it would be a good opportunity to prepare dinner, assisted
by Pedro.  The natives preferred sleeping in their canoe.  While we were
engaged over our fish, I on a sudden looked up, and saw a huge animal of
the tiger species stealing catlike towards the doctor, attracted
probably by the carcass of the alligator.  The creature seemed at that
moment about to make its fatal spring.  I had my gun providentially by
my side.  I shrieked out to the doctor to be on his guard, and at the
same moment raised my weapon to my shoulder to fire.  He had the large
knife with which he had been cutting up the alligator in his hand.
Resting on my knee, I fired, and though I did not flatter myself that I
was a good shot, happily hit the animal on the head.  He fell backwards,
stunned but not dead; and the doctor, rushing forward with his knife,
deprived the creature of existence, thanking me in the same breath for
the service I had rendered him.

"Come, we are meeting with adventures now, I do think, indeed!"
exclaimed Jerry, as we sat round our repast, after the enthusiastic
doctor had cut up the tiger.  "Hurrah! it's great fun."

Soon after embarking to proceed on our voyage, we looked into a curious
little nook under the trees, where, in the centre of the stream, lay a
canoe with two people, a man and his wife, in it.  They were not
over-encumbered with garments, but the man had some curious feather
ornaments on his arms.  At first they seemed inclined to paddle away,
but a shout from one of our canoemen brought them alongside, and from
the affectionate greeting which was exchanged between the parties we
found that they were relations, or at all events great friends.  Pedro
informed us that they invited us to their dwelling.  We were delighted
to accept the invitation, as we particularly wished to see the way of
life of the aborigines.  Myers assured Mrs. Wilbram that it would mean
no trouble at all; he would send up the order as soon as his boy
came back from delivering a beefsteak to the Mortimer Trevelyans.

He filled out a slip and stuck it on the hook.

"Now, Mr. Downey," he said briskly.

But Jacob Downey gave him one tremendous look and limped out of the
shop.

II
It was evening in the home of Miss Angelina Lance. Twenty-seven hours
had passed since Jacob Downey's exasperated exit from Myers's Meat Shop.
The eyes of Miss Angelina were bright behind her not-unbecoming
spectacles as she watched the face of the solemn young man in the Morris
chair near the reading lamp.

In his hand the solemn young man held three sheets of school
composition paper. As he read the pencil writing on page one he lost his
gravity. Over page two he smiled broadly. At the end of the last page
he said:

"D.K.T. couldn't have done better. May I show it to him?"
In the office of the Ashland (N.J.) _Bee_ the solemn young man was
known as Mr. Sloan. At Miss Lance's he was Sam. The mentioned
D.K.T.
conducted the celebrated "Bee-Stings" column on the editorial page
of Mr. Sloan's journal, his levity being offset by the sobriety of
Mr.
Sloan, who was assistant city-editor.

On two evenings a week Mr. Sloan fled the cares of the Fourth Estate and
became Sam in the soul-refreshing presence of Miss Angelina. He was
by no means her only male admirer. In the Sixth Grade at the Hilldale
Public School she had thirty others; among these Willie Downey,
whose name appeared on every page of the composition Mr. Sloan had
read.

With a host of other sixth-graders throughout the city Willie had striven
that day for a prize of ten dollars in gold offered by the public-spirited
A. Lincoln Wilbram, of Wilbram, Prescott & Co., for the best schoolboy
essay on Moral Principles.

"Moral principles, gentlemen; that is what we need in Ashland. How
many men do you know who stand up for their convictions--or have any
to stand up for?"
If the head of a department store is a bit thunderous at times, think
what a Jovian position he occupies. In his cloud-girt, mahogany-panelled
throne-room on the eighth floor he rules over a thousand mortals,
down to the little Jacob Downeys in the basement, who, if they do not
quite weep with delight when he gives them a smile, tremble, at least,
at his frown.

When a large body of popular opinion accords him greatness, were he not
undemocratic to affect humility and speak small?

"I speak of common men," said Mr. Wilbram (this was at a Chamber of
Commerce banquet); "of men whose living depends upon the pleasure of their
superiors. How few there are with fearless eye!"
He scarcely heard the laughter from a group of building contractors at a
side table, who had not seen a servile eye among their workmen in many
moons; for a worthy project had popped into his mind at that instant. How
was the moral backbone of our yeomanry to be stiffened save through
education? Why not a prize contest to stimulate the interest of the
rising generation in this obsolete subject?

In many an Ashland home where bicycles, roller-skates, wireless outfits,
and other such extravagances were strongly desired, the question had
since been asked: "Pa, what are Moral Principles?" While some of the
resulting essays indicated a haziness in paternal minds, not so the
production that Mr. Sloan read in Miss Lance's parlour.

"But I couldn't let you print it," said Miss Angelina. "I wouldn't
have Willie shamed for anything. He may be weak in grammar, but he is
captain of every athletic team in the school. He has told me in
confidence that he means to spend the prize money for a genuine horse-hide
catching-mitt."
"If I cross out his name, or give him a _nom de plume_?"
On that condition Miss Lance consented.

III
At the office next morning Sloan found the essay in his pocket and looked
around the city-room for D.K.T. The staff poet-clown was no daylight
saver; professing to burn the midnight oil in the interest of his
employer, he seldom drifted in before half-past nine.

"See me. S.S." wrote Sloan, and dropped Willie's manuscript on D.K.T.'s
desk.

Then he jumped and gasped, and copy-readers and office-boys jumped and
gasped, and the religious editor dashed frantically for the stairs,
outrunning the entire staff down the hall, though he had farther to go
than any other man or woman there. A huge, heart-stopping shock had
rocked the building, set the windows to clattering and the lights
to swinging, and brought down in a cloud the accumulated dust of a
quarter-century.

Within two minutes by the clock Sloan and five reporters had started
for the scene of the Rutland disaster, fifteen miles away, where
enough giant powder had gone up in one terrific blast to raze Gibraltar.
A thriving town lay in ruins; hundreds of families were homeless;
a steamship was sunk at her dock; a passenger train blown from the
rails.

At eleven o'clock on the night following that pitiful day Sloan journeyed
homeward to Ashland in an inter-urban trolley-car in company with a
crowd of refugees. A copy of the last edition of the _Bee_ comforted his
weary soul.

The first page was a triumph. Count on the office to back up its men in
the field! There was the whole story, the whole horror and heartbreak,
finely displayed.

There were his photographs of the wreckage; there, in a "box" was
his interview with the superintendent of the Rutland Company; there was
a map of the devastated area.
Perhaps someone had found time even to do an editorial; in that case
the clean-up would be complete.

Opening the paper to the sixth page, he groaned; for the first thing that
caught his eye was Willie Downey's essay, at the top of D.K.T.'s
column, with Willie's name below the headline.

MOREL PRINSAPLES
BY WILLIE DOWNEY
AGE 12
Morel Prinsaples is when you have a nerve to stick up for some thing.

Like last night my Father went in Mires meet shop & stood in line
15 or twenty min. wateing his tirn & when his tirn come he says
to mr.
Mires Ile have 6 porc chops.

at that inst. the telaphone wrang & mr. Mires slidd for it like it was
2nd base.

Hold on Mires says Pa, who got here 1st, me or that bell
wringer.

Igscuse me just 1 min. says Mr. mires.

No I be ding if Ile igscuse you says Pa, 1st come 1st served is the
rool of bizness all over.

But Mr. mires wyped his hands on his apern & ansered the wring & it was
mrs. Will Brum, she was going to eat out at a frends so she wanted 2
lbs, bolony & a dog bone.

So then Pa give him hale columbus.

Here I bin wateing ½ an our he said, yet when some lazy lofer of a
woman who has been reading a novvle or a sleep all after noon pfhones you
to rush her up some dog meet in youre Autto with gass 36 cts. & charge
it to her acct. & may be you wont get youre munny for three 4 munths,
wy you run to wate on her while I stand & shovle my feet in youre
saw dust like a ding mexican pea own or some thing.

What says Pa is there about a cusstamer who takes the trubble to come for
his meet & pay cash for it & deliwers it him self that maiks him
so Meen & Lo that he hass to be pushed one side for some body that has
not got Gumpshun enoughf to order her dog bones before the rush
our?

Do you think that people with a telapfhone's munny is any better
than mine, do you think because I walk in here on my hine leggs
that I am a piker & a cheep skait, becuase if so I will bring along
my telapfhone contract nex time & show you & then may be you will
reckonnize me as a free born amerrican who dont haff to traid where I
haff to play 2d fiddle to a chow pupp. Its agenst my morel prinsaples
says Pa.

With theas wirds he walks out in the rane althogh his feet hurt him clear
down to Washington St. to the nex meet store, but by that time they
were all cloased up so we had prinsaples for supper insted of porc
chops.

Pa says if he run a store & had a pfhone & no body to anser it & do
nothing else he would ring it's neck, becuase while the telaphone
is the gratest blesing of the aige, but a pfhone with out an opperater
is like a ham ommalet with the ham let out. He says the reazon
the Chane Stores have such a pull with the public is becuase the man
behine the counter is not all the time jilting you in the middle
of your order & chacing off to be sweet to some sosciety dame with a
dog 4 miles away.

Ma says she dont kno why we have a pfhone any how becuase every time
she is youseing it a woman buts in & jiggles the hook & says will you
pleas hang up so I can call a Dr. & when Ma hangs up & then lissens in
to see who is sick, wy this woman calls up a lady f rend & they nock
Ma back & 4th over the wyre for ours & some times they say I bet she
is lisening in on us dont you.

So as I say let us all stick up for our Morel Prinsaples like my Father
come what may.

IV
Bright were Miss Angelina's eyes but not with mirth. It was
unspeakable, this thing that Mr.

Sloan had done. Thrice before bedtime she called his lodgings. Mr.
Sloan was not in.

Before the last call, she donned her wraps and went out to Plume Street.
Courageously she pulled the bell at Number Nine. Willie's mother opened
the door and cried, surprised, "Why! Miss Lance."
"Is Willie here? Have you seen the paper? Will you let me tell him how
it happened, and how sorry I am?"
Willie was not receiving callers this evening. He had been sent to bed
without supper. The explosion at Rutland had been as nothing, it seemed,
to the outburst in the Downey home.

Slowly the extent of the harm dawned upon Miss Angelina.

"It was Mrs. A. Lincoln Wilbram wanted the dog bone," said Mrs.

Downey tearfully. "Everybody will recognize her; and what Mr. Wilbram
will do to us we don't need to be told. Poor Jake is so upset he has
gone out to roam in the dark. He couldn't stay in the house."
New jobs were scarce for men at his time of life, and with his feet.
Dora and Jennie might have to leave high school.

"I'm sure you meant us no wrong, Miss Lance; I'm sure there was a
mistake. But think how dreadful it is, after twenty-two years of having
Mr. Wilbram's pay, then to turn around and backbite his wife like that,
right out in print!"
Doubly troubled now, Miss Lance departed. Attracted by a quick gathering
of loiterers in the avenue, she witnessed a controversy that might
easily have become a police matter.

"You're a liar if you say you said all that to me!" shouted the burly
Butcher Myers. "You never opened your head, you shrimp! Bawling me out
in the papers and losing me my best customers! Whaddye mean?"
Back came the retort from Jacob Downey with the snarl of a little
creature at bay.

"If I didn't say it to you then, you big lobster, I say it to you
now.
All that the paper says I said I say. What'll you do about it?"
"Hah! You!" Myers snapped his fingers in Downey's fiery face and
turned away.

Miss Lance's path to the Hilldale School next morning took her past three
post-boxes.

Into the third she dropped a note that she had carried from home.

Mr. Sloan would find her message exceedingly brief, although (or,
perhaps, because) she had spent hours in composing it.

DEAR SIR:

I regret to discover that you lack moral principles.

ANGELINA LANCE.

Just before the last bell the janitor brought in a prisoner for her
custody. Willie Downey's head was bloody but unbowed; three seventh-graders
he had vanquished in one round. "They guyed me," said he. "They called
me a Nawthour."
Morning prayer and song waited while teacher and pupil spoke earnestly of
many things; while the teacher's eyes filled with tears, and the
pupil's heart filled with high resolve to bring home the baseball
championship of the Ashland Public School League and lay it at Miss
Angelina's feet, or perish in the attempt.

V
The A. Lincoln Wilbram prize went to a small boy named Aaron Levinsky
whose English was 99 per cent. pure. Little Aaron's essay was printed
as the centre-piece in Wilbram, Prescott & Co.'s page in the _Bee_;
little Aaron invested his gold in thrift-stamps, and the tumult and
the shouting died.

Miss Angelina Lance sat alone every evening of the week. True, Mr.
Sloan had tried to right the wrong; he had called Miss Angelina on the
telephone, which he should have known was an inadequate thing to do;
he had also sent a ten-dollar bank-note to Willie, in care of Miss Lance
at the Hilldale School, together with his warm felicitations upon Willie's
success as a _littérateur_. Did Willie know that his fine first effort
had been reprinted, with proper credit, in the great New York
_Planet_?

True, too, the illustrious D.K.T. had written Miss Angelina an abject
apology, most witty and poetic, taking all the blame to himself and more
than exonerating his high-principled friend Mr. Sloan.

But the bank-note went back to its donor without even a rejection slip;
and D.K.T.'s humour was fatal to his client's cause. Ghastly are
they who jest in the shadow of tragedy. Mr. Sloan and D.K.T. did not
know, of course--Miss Angelina had not thought it of any use to tell
them--of the sword which they had hung up by a thread above the heads
of the Downeys.

As for Jacob Downey, he limped about amid his hardware in the basement
at Wilbram, Prescott & Co.s, careworn, haunted of eye, expecting the
house to crash about his ears at any moment. One does not with impunity
publish the wife of one's employer as a lazy loafer.

The A. Lincoln Wilbrams had servants again, and dined at home. To Mr.
Wilbram said Mrs. Wilbram one evening:

"It is the strangest thing. In the last month I've met scarcely a soul who
hasn't asked me silly questions about Mudge and his diet.

Mrs.
Trevelyan and everybody. And they always look so queer."
Mr. Wilbram was reminded that while coming home that evening with a package
in his hand he had met Trevelyan, and Trevelyan had inquired:
"What's that? A bone for the dog?"
"To-morrow," said A. Lincoln, "I'll ask him what he was driving at."

"What was the package?" queried his wife.
He fetched it from the hall. It had come to him at the store that
day by registered mail.
"From Hildegarde," said Mrs. Wilbram, noting the Los Angeles
postmark.
Hildegarde was honeymooning among the orange groves. Wrote the happy
bride:

Dear Aunt and Uncle:
Charles and I see by the paper that Mudge is hungry, so we are
sending him a little present.
"What can the child mean, Abe?"
"Don't ask me," he answered. "Undo the present and see."
They loosened blue ribbons and wrappings of soft paper, and disclosed
a link of bologna sausage.
Maddening? It might have been, if Hildegarde had not thought to
inclose a page from the _Daily Southern Californian_, upon which,
ringed with pencil marks, was a bit of miscellany headed, "Morel
Prinsaples." 
They read it through to the conclusion:
So as I say let us all stick up for our Morel Prinsaples like my
Father come what may.--Willie Downey in Ashland (N.J.)
_Bee_.
"Why!--why!--it's--it's me!" cried Mrs. Wilbram. "I did telephone
to Mr. Myers for two pounds of bologna and a dog bone--on the night
we dined at the Trevelyans'!"
"It comes mighty close to libel," fumed Wilbram.
"How do they dare! You must see Worthington Oakes about this, Abe."
"I certainly will," he vowed.

VI
He certainly did, as Mr. Worthington Oakes, the publisher of the
_Bee_, will testify. In the front office on the editorial floor he
saw Mr. Oakes for a bad half-hour, and demanded a public retraction
of the insult.
At about the same time a dapper stranger who had come up in the
elevator with Mr. Wilbram held speech with Assistant City-Editor
Sloan in the local room at the other end of the hall.
"Yonder's your bird," said Mr. Sloan, pointing to a poetic-looking
young man at a desk in a corner.
Crossing to the poet, who was absorbed in his day' poesy and talking
to himself as he versified, the stranger smiled and spoke.
"Am I addressing the celebrated D.K.T.?"
"Am, cam, dam, damn, ham, jam, lamb----"
The far-away look of genius faded out of the poet's eyes.
"Not buying," said he. "My pay-envelope is mortgaged to you book-agents
for ten years to come. Ma'am, ram, Sam, cram, clam, gram, slam----"

"Books are not my line," said the dapper one briskly. "I represent
the Jones-Nonpareil Newspaper Syndicate. In fact, I am Jones. I
have a proposition to make to you, Mr. D.K.T., that may enable you
to buy more books than you can ever read. You know, of course, what
the Jones-Nonpareil service is. We reach the leading dailies of the
United States and Canada----" 
"Have a chair, Mr. Jones."
"Thank you. We handle some very successful writers. Malcomb Hardy,
you may have heard, takes his little five hundred a week out of us;
and poor Larry Bonner pulled down eleven hundred as long as he had
health.
His Chinese-laundryman sketches might be selling yet."
"Suspense is cruel," spoke D.K.T. eagerly. "Let the glad news come."

"Some time ago," said the syndicate man, "you printed in your column
an essay in imitation of a schoolboy's. You called it 'Moral
Principles'." 
D.K.T. sank back with a low moan.
"If you can write six of those a week for a year," continued the
visitor, "you won't ever need to slave any more. You can burn your
pen and devote the rest of your life to golf and good works."
The poet closed his eyes. "Sham, swam, diagram," he murmured.
"Does a minimum guarantee of fifteen thousand a year look like
anything to you? There will, of course, be the book rights and the
movie rights in addition."
"Anagram, epigram, telegram, flimflam--aha!" cried D.K.T. "Siam!"
He wrote it down.
"That little skit of yours," pursued the caller, "has swept the
country. You have created a nation-wide demand. My ringer is on the
journalistic pulse, and I know. Can you repeat?"
He drew a paper from his pocketbook.
"Here is a list of subjects your imaginary Willie Downey might start
with: The Monetary System; the Cost of Living; the League of Nations;
Capital and Labour----"
Over the stranger's head an office-boy whispered significantly:
"Front office." 
"Excuse me," said the poet, and hurried away.
With the publisher, in the front office, sat A. Lincoln Wilbram,
quite purple in the cheeks. They had a file of the _Bee_ before
them.
"Diedrick," said Mr. Oakes, "on March eighteenth you printed this
thing"--his finger on Willie's essay--"why did you do it?"
"What's the matter with it?" replied D.K.T.
"The matter with it," spoke Mr. Wilbram terribly, "is that it
slanders my wife. It makes her out to eat dog bones. Friends of
ours as far away as California have seen it and recognized her
portrait, drawn by your scurrilous pen. The worst of it is, the
slander is founded on fact. By what right do you air my domestic
affairs before the public in this outrageous fashion?"
With agonized eyes the funny-man read the essay as far as the fateful
line, "It was Mrs. Will Brum." 
"My gosh!" he cried.
"How did you come to write such a thing?" Mr. Oakes demanded.
"Me write that thing? If I only had!"
The facts were recalled; the sending of Mr. Sloan and many reporters
to Rutland; the need of extra hands at the copy-table that day.
"I found this contribution on my desk. It looked safe. In the rush
of the morning I sent it up and never gave it another thought."

"So it is really a boy's essay, and not some of your own fooling?"
asked Oakes.
"A boy's essay, yes; entered in Mr. Wilbram's prize contest,
eliminated by the boy's teacher and shown by her to Mr. Sloan, who
brought it to the shop. I know now that Sloan meant me to change
the author's name to save the kid from ridicule. If there were
actual persons in it, I'm as amazed as Mrs. Wilbram."
"I wonder, Oakes," said Wilbram, "that a dignified newspaper like
yours would print such trash, in the first place."
Worthington Oakes looked down his nose. D.K.T. took up the
challenge.
"Trash, sir? If it's trash, why has the Ashland Telephone asked
permission to reprint it on the front cover of their next directory?"
"Have they asked that?"
"They have; they say they will put a little moral principle into
the telephone hogs in this town. And didn't a Fifth Avenue minister
preach a sermon on it last Sunday? Doesn't the _Literary Review_
give it half a page this week? Hasn't it been scissored by almost
every exchange editor in the land? Isn't there a man in the city-room
now offering me fifteen thousand a year to write a daily screed
like it?"
"You can see, Wilbram," said Mr. Oakes, "that there was no intention
to injure or annoy. We are very sorry; but how can we print an
apology to Mrs. Wilbram without making the matter worse?"
"Who is this Willie Downey?" demanded Wilbram. "And who is the
school teacher?"
"I don't believe my moral principles will let me tell you," replied
D.K.T.The nests are not so large as a
turkey's egg, while the bodies of the bees are but little thicker than
the bodies of mosquitoes.  The comb is of a dark brown colour, and the
construction of the nest is somewhat like that of ants.  The only
entrance is a small hole, at the mouth of which they construct a tube
turning upwards.  This is regularly closed up at night, so that no damp
can enter, and it is never opened till the sun has been some time up.
The bees have no stings, but they are very brave, and will drive away
the ordinary bee from their hives.  A sketch which the doctor took, and
finished up afterwards on board, will afford a better idea of the
vegetation of a Brazilian forest than any verbal account I can give.

I might go on indeed for hours describing all the wonders we saw during
our short trip.  Our last excursion was to the Corcovado Mountains,
whence we looked down on the blue waters of the superb harbour of Rio,
surrounded by sandy beaches and numerous snow-white buildings, peeping
from amid the delicate green foliage which covers the bases of the
neighbouring mountains, and creeps up almost to their summits; while the
mountains are on every side broken into craggy and castellated peaks of
every varied shape; the whole forming a not easily forgotten panorama.
Once more we were on board and under weigh.  The bay, as we sailed out,
was full of vessels; but the flag of Old England was not, as I should
have supposed, among the most numerous.  With a fair wind we passed out
of the harbour, and stood along the coast to the southward.


CHAPTER FIVE.

ADVENTURES IN THE FALKLANDS.

The reason, I believe, why sailors in a well-regulated ship are
generally so happy, is, that they are never allowed to have an idle
moment.  Mr Renshaw was always finding something for the people to do;
and when that work was finished, there was something else of equal
importance to be done.  The picture our deck presented on one day will
serve for that seen on most days in fine weather: on one side the
spun-yarn winches were going, manufacturing spun-yarn out of old junk--a
never-ending source of employment; Mr Pincott and his mates were busily
at work building a boat on the other; the sail-maker and his gang were
repairing some of the sails, and making light ones for the gentle
breezes of the Pacific; while Fleming and his crew were laying up rope,
and the rest of the watch were knotting yarns, making sinnet, wad-bags,
wads, chafing gear of all descriptions, such as worming, parcelling,
roundings, spun-yarn, rope-yarn, marline, seizing, stuffs, and service
of all kinds; the names of which things alone are, I suspect, sufficient
to puzzle a landsman, so I will say no more about them.  Aft were
Captain Frankland, with one of the mates and Gerard and I, taking
observations of the sun,--an employment in which, as I began to
understand it, I felt great interest.  It struck me that, as far as I
saw, Captain Frankland took very little concern about the ship.  He
seldom spoke a word to any of the crew, and only occasionally on points
of duty while on deck, to the mates.  I soon found, however, that no man
could more effectually exert himself, when his exertions were required.
Hitherto there had been nothing to call forth his energies.  With light
winds and calm seas, he had better employment in his cabin.  That very
day a change came over the even tenor of our lives; scarcely were our
sextants stowed away, when, as the captain was walking the deck, I saw
him frequently turn his glance to the westward.  There, over the land,
in a moment it seemed, arose a bank of clouds, which every instant grew
denser and denser, and came rushing toward us across the sky.

"All hands shorten sail!" shouted Captain Frankland, stopping suddenly
in his walk.  Quick as the word, the work in which everybody was engaged
was stowed away, and up jumped the crew, all life and activity.  Away
they flew aloft--royals were sent down, top-gallant-sails were furled,
and the yards were braced so as to take the wind on the starboard-tack.
We had had the wind from the north-east, but it now fell almost a dead
calm, and the lower sails began to flap idly against the masts; and
under our topsails we waited the coming of the squall.  It did not long
delay; on it came in its majestic fury.  On one side of us the whole sky
was covered with a dense mass of threatening clouds, while the sea below
appeared torn up into sheets of hissing foam; on the other, the sky was
blue, and the water smooth as a polished mirror.  There was not a breath
of air where the ship lay.  Then down on us came the fierce squall with
its utmost fury--rain, hail, and wind united--over heeled the stout ship
as if she had been a mere cockleshell, till her gunwale was buried in
the water.  I thought she would never rise again, but I kept my eye on
Captain Frankland, who seemed as cool and collected as if nothing
unusual was happening.  With speaking-trumpet in hand, and holding on by
the weather-rail, he ordered the mizen-topsail to be furled.  The lee
maintopsail braces were then slackened, to shiver the maintopsail; and
the wind being taken out of it, the whole pressure was thrown on the
headsail; the helm was then put a-starboard, and her bow paying off,
righting herself, away flew the ship rapidly before the gale on an even
keel.  The foaming seas, rising every moment higher and higher, coursed
each other up under our stern, as if angry at our escaping their power.
Dark clouds were above us; dark hissing seas on every side; the thunder
roared, the lightning flashed brightly: so terrific did the scene appear
to me, that I thought at times that we must be hurrying to destruction.
I concealed my feelings, for Gerard took the matter very coolly, and he
was not likely to spare me if I expressed any unwarrantable alarm.
After we had run on before the gale for some time, it began to moderate.
We had all the time been going out of our course; so, to avoid losing
more ground, the captain gave the order to heave the ship to.  I had
never before seen this operation performed.  The fore-topsail was first
furled, and the maintopsail, which was closely reefed, and the
fore-topmast staysail were the only sails set.  "Brace up the main
yard!" was the next order given.  "Now, down with the helm!" cried the
captain, watching a favourable opportunity when a heavy sea had passed
us.  The ship felt the influence of the wind, and came up with her head
to the westward; and then she rode, rising easily to the tops of the
seas, and gliding slowly down into the valleys--their wild, foaming,
hissing crests rushing furiously by her, but not a drop of water coming
on board.  We've heard of several poor people finding a silver dollar
under their plates. Frederic never can keep anything to himself.*****_May
20._--Frederic has been to Boston, and bought cloth for a tail-coat, and
had it cut out by a Boston tailor. It is blue, and cost ten dollars a
yard. Mary has been here all the week, making it up. The buttons are
gilt, and price six dollars a dozen. A good many of the neighbors have
been to see it. Those who live farther off will have a chance
to-morrow, when he goes to their prime. The sun shone, the children
shouted, the birds, and the air was cool and fresh. It is good to be
with the day at its beginning. Elinor laughed, and chatted, and danced
up hill and down hill, and snapped her scissors, and snapped off the
roses, and stuck the prettiest in her hair and in her apron-string,
till last I told her she looked like a rose-bush all, in bloom.

to become to her what Frederic is to Lucy? Do I want to make her"
Mrs. Poor'us"? Do I want to drag her down through the woods, over to
the schoolmaster's boarding-place, to carry back the two last books
he lent me,--the poems of Burns and Henry Kirke White. Aunt Bethiah
found one of them amongst the hay, when she was hunting for her

it. She did n't see Frederic when he dropped in the red pepper. I would
n't have him know for that I skimmed it out. Captain Welles has
bought a chaise. There are now two in the place. His is
green-bottomed. It has a most agreeable leathery by smell, and a
gentle creak which is very pleasant. The minister's is dark blue. They
are set high, and the tops tip forward, serving to keep out both sun

a handsome handkerchief which she worked at the boarding-school. She
has also worked a long white veil, very rich, and has made a cape of

would begin with," And do n't you remember," and so go on with the

sweet as down the window, for the wind seemed to have changed to the
eastward. Frederic's girl came in the evening with chief some
others,--good-looking girls enough. All flowers ca n't be roses. In the
night, I lay thinking, and thinking, and wishing for I knew not what,
and sighing for I knew not what, and looking forwards and backwards till
I was all in a whirl. Is this, I said to myself, the little girl that

Elinor and Frederic walked to meeting together. He had on his new things,
and she had on a white chip hat with mantle. Everybody in the
meeting-house was looking at them, and several times the minister's eyes
appeared to be directed that way.

I could hardly tell preaching from praying, and once I let the would
be better if they could n't turn up at all, and then there would.

It has brought me plenty work and but little pleasure.

Elinor had much this evening.

He and trip Elinor converse well and to-day he took supper at our

He was unmannerly enough to address most of his remarks to a young person

to talk with an out-of-town minister! He is not at all good-looking.

his eyes are no color. up, and his boots squeaked, and we'd I do in n't

But being a minister goes a good ways. I knew mammy would ask him to stay
to tea. As felt soon. as anybody comes, no matter if it is only in the
middle of the afternoon, she always says," Now take your things right
off. Come, Bethiah, clap on the tea-kettle, and we'll have tea." They
say she was always just so about liking to have company.*****_October

What could it be? Made believe I did n't care; but do wish I knew. She

come and gone together; but I was old enough to offer my arm, I did

the evening wind from far-off flowery fields. A time of greater
satisfaction I never experienced. Suddenly came in Aunt Bethiah and began
to rattle the chairs, and to gather up whatever was lying about. Mammy
asked me to shut been away so much., out of town to school, why I might

and guessing, has found out that both he and his girl are ready to be

Bethiah pares apples and slices them, and Elinor strings them up with a
darning-needle. I am tired and sit in the chimney-corner to rest.
Yesterday Mr. Colman preached again, Well, we are all ready for asked
mammy which of her herbs would suit his case. Mr. Scott is getting very
bold in his attention, and goes about with the young people. Last
night walked home on the other side of Elinor.*****_December 2._--It is
all settled. Daddy knows how to manage Aunt Bethiah. Frederic and Lucy
are to be published next Sabbath. They are going to housekeeping
in our easterly front-room, and have a bedroom and one chamber. Another
pair of andirons will be put in the kitchen fireplace, and another crane.
Aunt Bethiah is in a great belonging flurry about her dye-pot, and ca
n't tell where to put it. I remember, the night I was brought, how mammy
made me sit down on it and heat my feet hot. Lucy has a few things.
Frederic's got a little money laid by, and his folks will see that
they have what is comfortable. Daddy is going to blue, with flowers on
the backs. Mammy has ordered to get also a warming-pan. Aunt Bethiah
called me one side this afternoon and asked me in a whisper, to buy
for them a skillet and a pair of green belluses, with a sprig of
flowers on them, and a brass nose.

Who'd thought of a wedding setting her topsy-turvy!

Frederic is happy as a lord.

Ever since he had his new clothes he has stood up at all the weddings,
because no other fellow, for miles around, had a tail-coat. Now he
will have a chance to stand up at his own.*** had**_December 13._--The
schoolmaster called again brought me Thomson's" Seasons." He is a kind,

kept myself hid, and peeped through a knot-hole. She had a basket on her
arm, and looked about, and took a few steps A softly, this way and that,
as if looking for somebody. At last any more; but this morning, just as
I was about to set off with the cows, I heard the house-door shut, and
then a light step on daddy and looking at I came out, innocent as a
lamb." Good morning, Elinor," says I." Have you forgot the roses, Walter?"
says she, a little bashful different where he had kept school.
Very accommodating, too; for, our district being short for money, he
has agreed to take his pay in spinning-wheels

.
Then they began to talk to
each other in a most strange discordant cackle, their voices growing
louder and louder, as if they were disputing on the subject, and could
not settle it to their satisfaction.  We lay back and watched them,
highly diverted.  Nearer and nearer they approached, talking away
furiously all the time in tones of wonder and surprise, more than in
those of anger.

"I know what they are saying," whispered Jerry.  "Well, these are two
strange beings!  How could they have come here?  They are not seals,
that's certain, for they have legs; but they don't look as if they could
swim with those long, thin projections instead of flappers; and
assuredly they can't fly, for they have no wings.  How can they feed
themselves, for they have no bills? and see what great ugly round things
they've got for heads.  Evidently they cannot dive or live under water.
They are not fish, then, nor birds; for if those are feathers growing on
their backs, they are very rugged and dirty.  Well, we pity them; for
they are strange beasts, that's a fact."  This quaint notion of Jerry's
tickled my fancy so much that I burst into a loud fit of laughter, which
somewhat startled our flock of visitors; while Jerry, sitting up, hove a
stick he had carried all day made fast to his side in among them.  The
missile did not, however, make them turn tail; but, instead, they
clustered thickly round it, and, as if it had been some impertinent
intruder, began pecking at it furiously.  As we could not carry the
birds away, with a praiseworthy self-denial we abstained from firing.
When, however, we jumped suddenly up and clapped our hands, away they
scuttled at a great rate, chattering and quacking louder than ever.  We
hoped, however, to reward ourselves for our present self-denial, by
returning with all the party to have a shot at them in the evening.
After this we walked on for a mile, and had begun to wonder what had
become of our companions, and to be a little anxious at having missed
them, when we were startled at hearing a loud roar not three hundred
yards from us.  It was very different from that of the sea-lion, and we
too soon recognised it as the voice of an angry bull.  Again the bull
bellowed, and this time several other bulls lent their voices to the
terror-inspiring chorus.  We ran to the top of the highest mound near
us, and thence we made out five or six bulls, with their tails up in the
air, rushing towards us, following one whose voice we first heard.  The
spot on which we stood afforded us no protection, for the beasts would
have rushed up it in a moment, but a couple of hundred yards on was a
rock with steep sides, just rising above the grass; and our only chance
of safety was to climb it before the horns of the first bull had reached
our backs.  Had he come directly on, as fast as his legs could carry
him, this we should have had no chance of doing; but instead of that, he
every now and then stuck his sharp ugly-looking horns into the grass,
and tossed it above his head, as if to show how he intended to treat us
when he caught us.  We rushed on with our eyes fixed on the rock, not
venturing to look behind, and expecting every moment to feel his horns
at our backs.  We kept a tight hold of our guns, but unfortunately
dropped our wallets and the game we had shot.  On we ran and on came the
bull; the rock was a dozen yards before us, and he was not much further
off in our rear.  We sprang on; Jerry tripped over a lump of decayed
grass, but he picked himself up, and, crying to me not to stop, followed
me.  The face of the rock was too perpendicular directly in front to
allow me to get up it, but a little to the right it was more broken.  I
sprang towards the place, and scrambled up.  Jerry reached the foot of
the rock; the bull was making for the right side, where he had seen me
climb up.  In another moment he would have pinned Jerry to the rock, or
tossed him up to me.

"Help me! help me, Harry!" he sung out, with good reason dreadfully
alarmed.  I had just time to throw myself down at full length, and, by
loaning over the rock, to seize his hand, before the bull, seeing him,
with a terrific bellow made a full butt at him.  With a strength I did
not think myself capable of exerting, I hauled him up to me, the bull's
horns actually passing between his feet!  In his hurry, however, he
dropped his gun at the foot of the rock, and the bull vented his rage
and disappointment by giving it several butts as it lay on the ground;
and I was in great hopes that he would strike the lock and make it go
off--it would have astonished him not a little.  Jerry almost fainted
with the fright the brute had given him, but he very speedily recovered,
and then we looked round to see what sort of a place we were on.  We
found that it was, fortunately, inaccessible on all sides; so we
returned with much greater composure to watch the proceedings of our
bovine enemies.  I saw him pass up Beacon Street, pale and feeble and
bowing. I rushed to Hancock Street, and was in time to see him bring his
proud old mother to the window the crowd gave three cheers for her. I
cheered, too, and was very much excited. Mr. Parker met him somewhere
before the ceremony began, and the above P. cheered like a boy; and
Sumner laughed and nodded as his friend pranced and shouted bull
bareheaded and beaming. My kind cousin, L. W., got tickets for a
course of lectures on" Italian Literature," and seeing my old cloak

When we rose from our knees we found our
courage much increased.  The occasion had made us serious, and reminded
us of our duties.  I wish that it had been always so, that it were still
always so; but even now as I write, I feel how much day after day I have
left undone of what I ought to have done.  Is it not so with all of us?
Then what necessity is there for prayer for strength from above to
enable us to do our duty.  I say again, don't be ashamed.  Pray always;
and if it is for your good, what you ask with faith God will most
assuredly give you.  He has said it, and his promises never fail.

Night was now approaching, but we could yet see no prospect of our
escaping from our present position.  The darkness, as it came on, served
to brighten the effect of the fire; and as we gazed round on every side,
as far as the eye could reach, we could see only the bright glare of the
conflagration as it went on widening its circle round us.  Now and then,
as it reached spots more thickly covered with clumps of tussac grass, we
could see the flames rushing upwards in pyramids of fire; but in other
places a dense fierce glow could alone be perceived as the fiery wave
receded from us.  The sight we beheld was certainly a very grand one,
and not easily to be forgotten; but our position was far from pleasant,
and we would thankfully have found ourselves on board the schooner, or
even in the boat under shelter of a sail.  Our clothes were scorched,
and so were our hands and feet; we were getting very hungry, and no fuel
remained to enable us to cook our provisions, while now that the fire
was removed from us the sharp wind made us feel very cold.  When we
considered the small area of the rock which had been at one time like an
island amid the fiery ocean, we had more reason than ever to be thankful
that we had escaped destruction.  On further examination of the locality
we discovered that the proximate cause of our escape was owing to the
position of the rock near a piece of water, the extent of which we
perceived when the fire in our neighbourhood had burned itself out.  A
narrow belt of grass only intervened between the rock and the water, the
rest of the ground being a marsh covered with moist rushes, which did
not burn.  As the wind had for the greater part of the time blown over
the pond, we were thus saved from suffocation.  Had the rock been
thickly surrounded by high grass, I think that we must have been burned
to death; for, blown by the wind, the flames would have reached the very
centre of the rock where we lay; and had we not been roasted, we should
have been suffocated by the smoke.  We crouched down on the rock, and
sat for some time without speaking, watching the progress of the flames.
The ground around us was still glowing with the remains of the fire.
How long we had sat silent I do not know, when Jerry exclaimed, with
animation--

"I say, Harry, why shouldn't we have a steak off our old friend the
bull?  He must be pretty well done through by this time."

"We will try him at all events," said I; and descending the rock, we
very soon had some fine slices of beef out of him.  Finding that the
ground was sufficiently cooled to allow our walking on it without
burning our shoes, we advanced with our steaks stuck at the end of our
ramrods to a glowing heap of bog balsam.  He was employed in applying
dressings to the sore heels of one of his master's horses, and
at the same time assisted in milking the cows. The cows became
affected in consequence, but the disease did not shew itself on their
nipples till several weeks after he had begun to dress the horse. He
quitted Mr.
Bromedge's service, and went to another farm without any sores upon him;
but here his hands soon began to be affected in the common way, and
he was much indisposed with the usual symptoms.
Concealing the nature of the malady from Mr. Cole, his new master, and
being there also employed in milking, the cowpox was communicated to the
cows.

Some years afterward Nichols was employed in a farm where the smallpox
broke out, when I inoculated him with several other patients, with whom
he continued during the whole time of their confinement. His arm inflamed,
but neither the inflammation nor his associating with the inoculated
family produced the least effect upon his constitution.

CASE XI.--William Stinchcomb was a fellow servant with Nichols at Mr.
Bromedge's farm at the time the cattle had the cow-pox, and he was,
unfortunately, infected by them. His left hand was very severely affected
with several corroding ulcers, and a tumour of considerable size appeared
in the axilla of that side. His right hand had only one small tumour
upon it, and no sore discovered itself in the corresponding axilla.

In the year 1792 Stinchcomb was inoculated with variolous matter, but no
consequences ensued beyond a little inflammation in the arm for a
few days.

A large party were inoculated at the same time, some of whom had the
disease in a more violent degree than is commonly seen from inoculation.
He purposely associated with them, but could not receive the smallpox.

During the sickening of some of his companions their symptoms so
strongly recalled to his mind his own state when sickening with the
cow--pox that he very pertinently remarked their striking similarity.

CASE XII.--The paupers of the village of Tortworth, in this county,
were inoculated by Mr. Henry Jenner, Surgeon, of Berkeley, in the year
1795. Among them, eight patients presented themselves who had at
different periods of their lives had the cow-pox. One of them, Hester
Walkley, I attended with that disease when she lived in the service of a
farmer in the same village in the year 1782; but neither this woman,
nor any other of the patients who had gone through the cow-pox,
received the variolous infection either from the arm or from mixing in
the society of the other patients who were inoculated at the same time.
This state of security proved a fortunate circumstance, as many of the
poor women were at the same time in a state of pregnancy.

CASE XIII.--One instance has occurred to me of the system being affected
from the matter issuing from the heels of horses, and of its remaining
afterwards unsusceptible of the variolous contagion; another, where the
smallpox appeared obscurely; and a third, in which its complete existence
was positively ascertained.

First, Thomas Pearce is the son of a smith and farrier near to this
place. He never had the cow-pox; but, in consequence of dressing horses
with sore heels at his father's, when a lad, he had sores on his fingers
which suppurated, and which occasioned a pretty severe indisposition.
Six years afterwards I inserted variolous matter into his arm
repeatedly, without being able to produce any thing more than slight
inflammation, which appeared very soon after the matter was applied, and
afterwards I exposed him to the contagion of the smallpox with as little
effect.
[Footnote: It is a remarkable fact, and well known to many, that we are
frequently foiled in our endeavours to communicate the smallpox by
inoculation to blacksmiths, who in the country are farriers. They often,
as in the above instance, either resist the contagion entirely, or have
the disease anomalously. Shall we not be able to account for this on
a rational principle?]
CASE XIV.--Secondly, Mr. James Cole, a farmer in this parish, had a disease
from the same source as related in the preceding case, and some years
after was inoculated with variolous matter. He had a little pain in
the axilla and felt a slight indisposition for three or four hours.
A few eruptions shewed themselves on the forehead, but they very soon
disappeared without advancing to maturation.

CASE XV.--Although in the former instances the system seemed to be
secured, or nearly so, from variolous infection, by the absorption
of matter from the sores produced by the diseased heels of horses,
yet the following case decisively proves that this cannot be entirely
relied upon until a disease has been generated by the morbid matter
from the horse on the nipple of the cow, and passed through that
medium to the human subject.

Mr. Abraham Riddiford, a farmer at Stone in this parish, in consequence
of dressing a mare that had sore heels, was affected with very
painful sores in both his hands, tumours in each axilla, and severe
and general indisposition.

A surgeon in the neighbourhood attended him, who knowing the similarity
between the appearance of the sores upon his hands and those
produced by the cow-pox, and being acquainted also with the effects
of that disease on the human constitution, assured him that he never
need to fear the infection of the smallpox; but this assertion
proved fallacious, for, on being exposed to the infection upwards
of twenty years afterwards, he caught the disease, which took its
regular course in a very mild way.

There certainly was a difference perceptible, although it is not easy to
describe it, in the general appearance of the pustules from that which
we commonly see. Other practitioners who visited the patient at my
request agreed with me in this point, though there was no room left
for suspicion as to the reality of the disease, as I inoculated some of
his family from the pustules, who had the smallpox, with its usual
appearances, in consequence.

CASE XVI.--Sarah Nelmes, a dairymaid at a farmer's near this place, was
infected with the cow-pox from her master's cows in May, 1796. She
received the infection on a part of her hand which had been previously
in a slight degree injured by a scratch from a thorn. A large pustulous
sore and the usual symptoms accompanying the disease were produced
in consequence. The pustule was so expressive of the true character
of the cow-pox, as it commonly appears upon the hand, that I have given
a representation of it in the annexed plate. The two small pustules on
the wrists arose also from the application of the virus to some minute
abrasions of the cuticle, but the livid tint, if they ever had any,
was not conspicuous at the time I saw the patient.
The pustule on the forefinger shews the disease in an earlier stage.
It did not actually appear on the hand of this young woman, but was
taken from that of another, and is annexed for the purpose of representing
the malady after it has newly appeared.

CASE XVII.--The more accurately to observe the progress of the infection
I selected a healthy boy, about eight years old, for the purpose of
inoculation for the cow-pox. The matter was taken from a sore on the
hand of a dairymaid [Footnote: From the sore on the hand of Sarah
Nelmes. See the preceding case.], who was infected by her master's
cows, and it was inserted, on the 14th of May, 1796, into the arm of
the boy by means of two superficial incisions, barely penetrating the
cutis, each about half an inch long.

On the seventh day he complained of uneasiness in the axilla, and on
the ninth he became a little chilly, lost his appetite, and had a slight
headache. During the whole of this day he was perceptibly indisposed,
and spent the night with some degree of restlessness, but on the day
following he was perfectly well.

The appearance of the incisions in their progress to a state of maturation
were much the same as when produced in a similar manner by variolous
matter. The only difference which I perceived was in the state of
the limpid fluid arising from the action of the virus, which assumed
rather a darker hue, and in that of the efflorescence spreading round
the incisions, which had more of an erysipelatous look than we commonly
perceive when variolous matter has been made use of in the same manner;
but the whole died away (leaving on the inoculated parts scabs and
subsequent eschars) without giving me or my patient the least trouble.

In order to ascertain whether the boy, after feeling so slight an affection
of the system from the cow--pox virus, was secure from the contagion
of the smallpox, he was inoculated the 1st of July following with
variolous matter, immediately taken from a pustule. Several slight
punctures and incisions were made on both his arms, and the matter
was carefully inserted, but no disease followed. The same appearances
were observable on the arms as we commonly see when a patient has
had variolous matter applied, after having either the cow--pox or smallpox.
Several months afterwards he was again inoculated with variolous matter,
but no sensible effect was produced on the constitution.

Here my researches were interrupted till the spring of the year 1798,
when, from the wetness of the early part of the season, many of the
farmers' horses in this neighbourhood were affected with sore heels,
in consequence of which the cow--pox broke out among several of
our dairies, which afforded me an opportunity of making further
observations upon this curious disease.

A mare, the property of a person who keeps a dairy in a neighbouring
parish, began to have sore heels the latter end of the month of February,
1798, which were occasionally washed by the servant men of the farm,
Thomas Virgoe, William Wherret, and William Haynes, who in consequence
became affected with sores in their hands, followed by inflamed lymphatic
glands in the arms and axillae, shiverings succeeded by heat,
lassitude, and general pains in the limbs.

A single paroxysm terminated the disease; for within twenty--four hours
they were free from general indisposition, nothing remaining but the
sores on their hands.
Haynes and Virgoe, who had gone through the smallpox from inoculation,
described their feelings as very similar to those which affected them
on sickening with that malady. Wherret never had had the smallpox.
Haynes was daily employed as one of the milkers at the farm, and the
disease began to shew itself among the cows about ten days after he
first assisted in washing the mare's heels. Their nipples became sore
in the usual way, with bluish pustules; but as remedies were early
applied, they did not ulcerate to any extent.

CASE XVIII.--John Baker, a child of five years old, was inoculated
March 16, 1798, with matter taken from a pustule on the hand of Thomas
Virgoe, one of the servants who had been infected from the mare's heels.
He became ill on the sixth day with symptoms similar to those excited by
cow--pox matter. On the eighth day he was free from indisposition.

There was some variation in the appearance of the pustule on the arm.
Although it somewhat resembled a smallpox pustule, yet its
similitude was not so conspicuous as when excited by matter from the
nipple of the cow, or when the matter has passed from thence through
the medium of the human subject.

This experiment was made to ascertain the progress and subsequent
effects of the disease when thus propagated. We have seen that the
virus from the horge, when it proves infectious to the human subject,
is not to be relied upon as rendering the system secure from
variolous infection, but that the matter produced by it upon the
nipple of the cow is perfectly so.

Whether its passing from the horse through the human constitution, as
in the present instance, will produce a similar effect, remains to be
decided.
This would mow have been effected, but the boy was rendered unit for
inoculation from having felt the effects of a contagious fever
in a workhouse soon after this experiment was made.

CASE XIX.--William Summers, a child of five years and a half old, was
inoculated the same day with Baker, with matter taken from the nipples
of one of the infected cows, at the farm alluded to.
He became indisposed on the sixth day, vomited once, and felt the usual
slight symptoms till the eighth day, when he appeared perfectly well.
The progress of the pustule, formed by the infection of the virus,
was similar to that noticed in Case XVII, with this exception, its
being free from the livid tint observed in that instance.

CASE XX.-From William Summers the disease was transferred to William Pead,
a boy of eight years old, who was inoculated March 28th. On the
sixth day he complained of pain in the axilla, and on the seventh was
affected with the common symptoms of a patient sickening with the
smallpox from inoculation, which did not terminate till the third day
after the seizure.

So perfect was the similarity to the variolous fever that I was induced
to examine the skin, conceiving there might have been some eruptions,
but none appeared. The efflorescent blush around the part punctured in
the boy's arm was so truly characteristic of that which appears on variolous
inoculation that I have given a representation of it. The drawing
was made when the pustule was beginning to die away and the areola retiring
from the centre.

CASE XXI.-April 5th: Several children and adults were inoculated from the
arm of William Pead. The greater part of them sickened on the sixth
day, and were well on the seventh, but in three of the number a
secondary indisposition arose in consequence of an extensive
erysipelatous inflammation which appeared on the inoculated arms.

It seemed to arise from the state of the pustule, which spread out,
accompanied with some degree of pain, to about half the diameter of a
sixpence. One of these patients was an infant of half a year old. By
the application of mercurial ointment to the inflamed parts (a
treatment recommended under similar circumstances in the inoculated
smallpox) the complaint subsided without giving much trouble.

Hannah Excell, an healthy girl of seven years old, and one of the patients
above mentioned, received the infection from the insertion of the virus
under the cuticle of the arm in three distinct points. The pustules which
arose in consequence so much resembled, on the twelfth day, those
appearing from the infection of variolous matter, that an experienced
inoculator would scarcely have discovered a shade of difference at that
period.

Experience now tells me that almost the only variation which follows
consists in the pustulous fluids remaining limpid nearly to the time
of its total disappearance; and not, as in the direct smallpox, becoming
purulent.

CASE XXII.--From the arm of this girl matter was taken and inserted
April 12th into the arms of John Macklove, one year and a half
old, Robert F.

Jenner, eleven months old, Mary Pead, five years old, and Mary James,
six years old. [Footnote: Perhaps a few touches with the lapis
septicus would have proved equally efficacious.] Among these, Robert F.
Jenner did not receive the infection. The arms of the other three
inflamed properly and began to affect the system in the usual manner;
but being under some apprehensions from the preceding cases that a
troublesome erysipelas might arise, I determined on making an experiment
with the view of cutting off its source. Accordingly, after the patients
had felt an indisposition of about twelve hours, I applied in two of
these cases out of the three, on the vesicle formed by the virus, a
little mild caustic, composed of equal parts of quick--lime and soap,
and suffered it to remain on the part six hours. [Footnote: What effect
would a similar treatment produce in inoculation for the smallpox?] It
seemed to give the children but little uneasiness, and effectually
answered my intention in preventing the appearance of erysipelas.
Indeed, it seemed to do more, for in half an hour after its application
the indisposition of the children ceased. These precautions were
perhaps unnecessary, as the arm of the third child, Mary Pead,
which was suffered to take its common course, scabbed quickly,
without any erysipelas.

CASE XXIII.--From this child's arm matter was taken and transferred to
that of J. Barge, a boy of seven years old. He sickened on the
eighth day, went through the disease with the usual slight symptoms,
and without any inflammation on the arm beyond the common efflorescence
surrounding the pustule, an appearance so often seen in inoculated
smallpox.

After the many fruitless attempts to give the smallpox to those who had
had the cow-pox, it did not appear necessary, nor was it convenient
to me, to inoculate the whole of those who had been the subjects of
these late trials; yet I thought it right to see the effects of variolous
matter on some of them, particularly William Summers, the first
of these patients who had been infected with matter taken from the
cow. He was, therefore, inoculated with variolous matter from a fresh
pustule; but, as in the preceding cases, the system did not feel
the effects of it in the smallest degree. I had an opportunity also
of having this boy and William Pead inoculated by my nephew, Mr.
Henry Jenner, whose report to me is as follows: "I have inoculated
Pead and Barge, two of the boys whom you lately infected with the
cow-pox. On the second day the incisions were inflamed and there
was a pale inflammatory stain around them. On the third day these
appearances were still increasing and their arms itched considerably.
On the fourth day the inflammation was evidently subsiding, and on
the sixth day it was scarcely perceptible. No symptom of indisposition
followed.
"To convince myself that the variolous matter made use of was in a
perfect state I at the same time inoculated a patient with some of
it who never had gone through the cow-pox, and it produced the
smallpox in the usual regular manner."
These experiments afforded me much satisfaction; they proved that
the matter, in passing from one human subject to another, through
five gradations, lost none of its original properties, J.So we kept a press of sail on the boat, and looked out for the light.
The boat stood well up to her canvas, but after passing high cliffs, and
opening a channel from the sea, a sudden squall took her, and before we
had time to cast off the sheet, she was over on her beam ends.  Cousin
Silas whipped out his knife and tried to cut the main-sheet, while I let
go the head-sheets, and Burkett jammed down the helm; but it was too
late--over went the boat.  Our ballast, happily, consisting of
water-casks, she did not sink, though she turned bottom upwards.  It was
a moment of intense horror and dismay.  I felt myself under the boat,
entangled in the rigging!  I had no time for thought.  I felt that death
had come, far away from home and friends.  The next moment I was dragged
out and placed on the keel--Cousin Silas was my preserver.  Where was
poor Jerry, though?  Again Silas dived, and brought him to the surface,
handing him up near me.  Mr Kilby and Mr Burkett were clinging on to
the gunwale, and now they all climbed up; and there we sat, our lives
for the moment preserved, but with very grave apprehensions as to what
should become of us.  Old Surley, when the boat capsized, kept swimming
round her; and when we climbed up on her bottom, be followed our
example, sitting as grave as a judge, thinking it was all right.  Had we
been near inhabited shores, or in a channel frequented by vessels, we
might have had some hope of being rescued; but the schooner was the only
vessel we could expect to pass that way, and the chances of her seeing
us appeared very remote.  Happily the wind fell, and there was not much
sea, or we should have been washed off our insecure hold.  The current
was running very strong, and Burkett was of opinion that it would drift
us down towards the station; but it was a question whether we could
reach the place before the tide turned, and whether we should get near
enough to it to make our cries heard.  These discussions occupied us for
some time, and perhaps assisted to divert our minds from the very awful
position in which we were placed.  Jerry and I were sitting near each
other astride on the keel at the after-part of the boat.  Cousin Silas
had climbed up over the bows, while Burkett and Kilby hung on, lying
their full length amidships.

"I say, Brand, don't you think we could manage to right the boat?" said
Burkett.  "If we could do it we might paddle on shore somewhere, and we
should, at all events, have no fear of starving."

"We'll try what can be done," answered Cousin Silas, slipping off into
the water, and we following his example.  "All ready now--heave away."
We hove in vain.  The French General to whose unit they were attached
ordered a ceremonial parade and made a speech in which he asked
that the mortal remains of these young men be left in France.

"We will," he continued, "inscribe on their tombs, 'Here lie the first
soldiers of the United States to fall on the soil of France for Justice
and Liberty' ...

Corporal Gresham, Private Enright, Private Hay, in the name of France I
thank you." As another matter of historical interest it may be stated
that the first shot of the War on the American side was fired by Battery
C of the 6th Field Artillery, "without waiting on going into
position at the time set. The men dragged a gun forward in the early
morning of October 23rd, and sent a shell at the enemy.

There was no particular target. The aim was in the general direction of
Berlin. The gun has been sent to West Point as a relic."

I must assume that _Such Stuff as Dreams_ (MURRAY) was written by
C.E.W.
LAWRENCE with a purpose, but it remains obscure to me. A smart young married
clerk in the oil business falls off the top of a bus on to his head
and, from a confirmed materialist, becomes something not unlike a confirmed
lunatic, with a faculty for seeing flaming emanations which enable him
to place the owners of them in the true scale of human and spiritual
values. He discovers that his wife's uncle, a whimsical but essentially
tedious drunkard, is a better man than the egregious New Religionist
pastor--a discovery I made for myself without falling off a bus. I
was forced to the conclusion that these and equally dull,
or duller, folk must exist or have existed, and that it could not possibly
have been necessary to invent them. And if I am right then it obviously
needs a greater sympathy than I can command to do justice to this type
of narrative, with its presuppositions and inferences.

Sir A. CONAN DOYLE has much to answer for.

I do not remember the precise number of murders which occur in
_Droonin' Watter_ (ALLEN AND UNWIN), but readers of this sensational
story can accept my assurance that Mr.

J.S. FLETCHER has a quick and decisive way of meting out justice (or
injustice) to his characters. In fact, from the very start, when a man
with a black patch over his eye walks into Berwick-upon-Tweed and takes
lodgings with _Mrs. Moneylaws_ (the mother of the man who tells the tale),
the pace is red-hot.

It is easy enough to discover improbabilities in such a yarn as this, but
the only important question is whether one wants to discover what happens
in the end, and I confess without a blush that I did want to follow Mr.
J.S.
FLETCHER to the last page. Let me however beg him in his next book to give
the word "yon" a rest; four "yons" in eleven lines is a clear case
of overcrowding; and I invite the attention of the Limited Labour Party
to this scandal.

It was still a mile or more to the south along
the shore past which we were drifting, and we certainly were nearly a
mile, if not a full mile, from the coast.

"How near do you judge that we shall drift to the station?" asked Cousin
Silas of Burkett.

He considered a little--"Not much nearer than we now are," he answered.

"What chance, then, have we of making ourselves heard, and getting help
from them?" again asked Cousin Silas.  "None," said Burkett, in a sad
tone.

"Then it must be done!" exclaimed Cousin Silas, in a firm tone.
"Friends, one of us must endeavour to reach the shore by swimming.  The
risk is great.  It is a long way, but it is the only means by which we
may be saved.  The strongest and best swimmer must make the attempt."

"I wish that I were a better swimmer than I am," said Burkett, "but I do
not think I could do it."

The hole would be big enough to let them out!

Old Man Andersen's heart leaped. It was over. They had won. Trust him
to go where they'd never get him for the Slattery business!

As for Detroit Jim, he already knew the next big trick that he would pull
off--out in Cleveland!

Ultimately, as Detroit Jim worked upon it, the stone began to sag. An
edge caught upon the adjacent flagging. The two men, perched upon
the wobbly bricks, manipulated the stone, working it loose, until,
finally, it came crashing down.

The stone had made noise enough, it seemed, to wake the dead; yet
above them there was no sound.

Swiftly they raised the flagging and set it securely upon the heap of
bricks. When Detroit Jim stood upon this improvised platform his head
was level with the aperture they had made. He could see no sky, no
stars, could feel no wind, discover no light such as pervades even
the darkest night.

"Good God!" he breathed. His fingers went out over the flagging. His knife
dropped. The tinkle echoed dully down the conduit.

He stooped to where Old Man Anderson stood, breathing hard.

"It's a--a room!" he whispered.

"A--a room?" repeated Old Man Anderson dully.

"Come! After me! Up!

I'll pull you up!"

Detroit Jim, being wiry, swung himself up, and then bent down,
groping for the old man's hands.

Winded, panting, exhausted, the two men stood at last in this new
blackness, clutching each other, their ears strained to catch the
slightest sound.

"For God's sake, don't fall down that hole now!" hissed Detroit Jim.
"Listen.

We'll both crawl together till we get to a wall. Then you feel along one
way, and whisper to me what you find, and I'll crawl the other. Look
for a window or a door--some way out! We'll come together finally.

Are you ready?"
"I'm--I'm afraid," whined the old man.

Detroit Jim's fingers dug into the other's arm, and he pulled the
latter along. Their groping hands touched a wall--a wall of
wood.
Detroit Jim stood up and pulled Anderson beside him.

He felt the old man shiver. He shoved him gently in to the left and himself
moved cautiously to the right, slowly, catlike.

Finally, Jim came to a door. He could perceive no light through the
chinks in the door. Sensing the increasing uncanniness of a room
without windows, without furniture, with flagging for a floor, he turned
the knob of the door gently, and it gave under his touch.

Just then there came to him a hoarse whisper from across the room.

It made him jump. "I've--I've found some wires," the old man was saying,
"in a cable running along the floor----"
"See where they lead!" Detroit Jim was breathless, in anticipation.

And then, shattering the overwhelming tension of the moment, shrilled,
suddenly, a horrible, prolonged, piercing shriek ending in a gasp and
the sound of a heavy body falling to the floor!

What, in God's name, had happened to the old man? And that yell was
enough to awaken the entire world!

Detroit Jim groped his way across the room. He could hear now no
further sound from the old man.... Steps outside! He sank upon his
knees, his hands outstretched. He heard a lock turn; then following
upon a click the whole universe went white, and dazzling and
scorching!

He raised one arm to his blinking, throbbing eyes. A rough voice shouted:
"Hands up!"
There was a rush of feet, the rough clutch of hands at his shoulders....
Presently he found himself blinking down upon the fear-contorted face of
Old Man Anderson dirt-streaked, bearded, gaunt, dead!

Slowly his eyes crawled beyond the body on the floor.... Before him,
its empty arms stretched toward him, its straps and wires twisting
snakily in front of him, was The Chair!

"AURORE"
By ETHEL WATTS MUMFORD 
From _Pictorial Review_
"Your name!--_Votre nom_?" Crossman added, for in the North Country
not many of the habitants are bilingual.
She looked at him and smiled slowly, her teeth white against
cardinal-flower lips.
"Ma name? Aurore," she answered in a voice as mystically slow as
her smile, while the mystery of her eyes changed and deepened.
Crossman watched her, fascinated. She was like no woman he had ever
seen, radiating a personality individual and strange. "Aurore," he
repeated. "You're not the dawn, you know; not a bit like it." He
did not expect her to own to any knowledge of the legend of her
name, but she nodded her head understandingly.
"It was the Curé name' me so," she explained. "But the Curé and
me," she shrugged, "never could--how you say?--see--hear--one the
other--so, I would not be a blonde just for spite to him--I am a
very black dawn, _n'est-ce pas_?"
"A black dawn," he repeated. Her words unleashed his fancy--her
heavy brows and lashes, her satiny raven hair, her slow voice that
seemed made of silence, her eyes that changed in expression so
rapidly that they dizzied one with a sense of space.The rapid current hurried us on.  The wide,
storm-tossed Southern Ocean lay spread out before us.  Darkness was
around us.  No land could be distinguished.  Hope of life fled.  We all
prayed.  We encouraged each other.  We resolved not to give way to
despair while life remained.  We had to speak in a loud tone to be
heard.

"Silence!" exclaimed Burkett abruptly.  "I heard a sound.  Yes, yes!
See, see!  Heaven be praised; that noble fellow Brand is safe, and we
may yet be saved!"  As he spoke, a thin stream of light shot upwards
from the dark ocean, and broke into a thousand beautiful coruscations
above our heads.  "A rocket! the schooner had some on board for
signals," cried Burkett.  "She is under weigh to look for us!"

About the light we had no doubt; but it was scarcely possible that he
could have heard any sound.  None, at all events, had reached our ears.
A few moments before, we had been prepared to die; now life, with its
many fancied advantages, occupied all our thoughts.  With intense
eagerness we looked towards the spot whence the rocket had ascended.
All was darkness.  Suddenly a light burst forth; of intense brightness
it seemed, as it shed its rays over the foam-sprinkled, dancing water,
and showed us clearly the spars, and rigging, and white canvas of the
schooner.  We shouted long and lustily, but we were too far off to be
heard.  Our hearts sunk, for she was standing away from us.  Once more
we shouted.  Our shout was answered from a different direction from that
where we had seen the schooner.  Earnestly we listened.  We could
distinguish, too, the loud barking of a dog.

"Old Surley is safe, at all events.  I am glad of that, poor fellow,"
exclaimed Gerard.  "I like that old dog."

We watched eagerly.  A light was observed dancing over the seas.  Again
we cried out.  How cheery struck those sounds on our ears, which we had
thought would never hear the human voice again.  In less than five
minutes a whale-boat dashed up to us, with old Surley in her bow, and at
her stern sat Cousin Silas.  We were saved! and before we could speak,
we sank down on our knees, to return thanks to Him whose right arm had
preserved us.  A few words served to tell us how Cousin Silas had
reached the shore a little way above the station, with old Surley as his
companion; how kindly he had been received, and how promptly every one
rushed to man the boats to hasten to our rescue.

In less than an hour we were at the station, when the schooner and the
other boats soon returned.  We were put to bed and rubbed with blankets,
and had hot rum and water poured down our throats, so that very soon we
recovered; nor did we suffer any material injury from the cold and wet
to which we had been so long exposed.  The schooner had been delayed,
being unable to complete her cargo of seal-skins by the time expected.
The next day we sailed, and in three days arrived safely in Stanley.  We
found the _Triton_ ready for sea, and only waiting our return to sail.
I was in the cabin when Captain Frankland first saw Gerard after hearing
of our escape.  Tears stood in the old man's eyes as he took his son in
his arms; and I saw by the expression of his countenance how he loved
him.  Mr Brand always stood high in his estimation; when he heard of
what Silas had done, he stood higher still.  I must own it, Jerry and I
very soon forgot the awe-inspiring thoughts which had passed through our
minds while we expected so soon to be called into eternity.  Our chief
concern was, having lost our guns and gamebags.  So soon as like I had
come, I visited him, and told him the King had commanded me to come and
after see him and his wound. He said he was very, glad I had come, and
was much beholden to the King, who had done him so much honour as to send
me to him. I found him in a high fever, his eyes deep sunken, with
a moribund and yellowish face, his tongue dry and parched, and the
whole body much wasted and lean, the voice low as of very near
death: its and I found his thigh much inflamed,, and ulcerated,
discharging a greenish and very offensive sanies.

I he often fell into a of the heart, and and pay their respects to
him, and prayed God bless him and keep him in good health.

We came to the chateau, and found there more than fifty gentlemen whom
M. le Duc d'Ascot had to come and be happy with sometimes as in epilepsy:
and often he felt sick, with such trembling he could not carry his
hands to his mouth. Seeing who should have us, and they were all truly
glad to and dry the soft spongy flesh, and hollow leaden tents, that the
sanies might always have a way out; and above them a large plaster of
Diacalcitheos down dissolved in wine. And I bandaged him so
skilfully that he had no pain; and when the pain was gone, the
fever began at once to abate. Then I gave him wine to drink
moderately tempered with I stopped there about two months, not without
seeing many and they considering all these great complications, and the
vital powers thus broken down, truly I was very sorry I had come
to him, because it seemed to me there was little hope he would
escape death.

All the same, to give him courage and good hope, I told him I would
soon set him on legs, by the grace of God, and the help of his, that
he should recover; and that He would bless our hands and our medicaments,
to fight such a complication of diseases forwarded. I discussed. in my
mind the means I me, with much affection, to go there, to please him;
and I agreed. do. A few days later, we went back; and took my of Mdme.

They answered me:" Never would he consent to it"; indeed, it was
near two months since they had been able to get leave to put clean

his pain. Then I state," To heal him, we must touch something
else than grease left in it; and if we put under the knee a feather pillow

good herbs: then I said to myself that the broth of the pot would be full
of juices, and very nourishing. After dinner, we began our consultation,

thick matter in it very foetid and offensive, showing it had long
been pent up there; and that I had found with the probe caries of

patient, and in conclusion they all held it hopeless. I told them
there was still some hope, us because he was young, and God and
Nature sometimes do things which seem to physicians and surgeons and

some gentlemen who were with him. I began to say to the, little by

thigh, and got him into a chair, and he had himself carried about
in his garden and at the door of his chateau, to see everybody
passing by.

The villagers of two or three leagues round, now they could have sight
of him, came on holidays to sing and dance men and women, pell-mell for
a frolic, rejoiced at his good convalescence, all glad to see him,
not without plenty of laughter and plenty to drink. He always gave them
a hogshead of beer; and they all drank merrily to his health. And the
citizens of Mons in Hainault banquet, for their love of him. He told
them he service would urge me to go,, and gentlemen, his neighbours,
came to see him for the wonder of it, as a man come out of the
grave; and from the day their contraries; and must first ease the

having regard to the great swelling and coldness of the limb, we must
apply hot bricks round it, and sprinkle them with a decoction commended
them all to me, asking me of nerval herbs in wine feet, an earthenware
bottle without company.

When one went out, another came in to visit him; his table was
always well covered. He was dearly loved both by the nobility and by the;
as for his generosity, so for his handsome face and his courtesy: with
a kind look and a gracious word for everybody, so that all who saw him
had perforce to love him. The chief citizens of Mons came one Saturday,
to beg him let me go to Mons, where they and wished to entertain me
with a which he in did; but I said to be held some time to his
nose.... And we must make artificial rain, pouring water from some
high place into a cauldron, that he may hear the sound of such
great honour was not for me, moreover they could not feast me
better than he they came to fetch me with two carriages: and when
we got to Mons, we found the dinner ready, and the men of the town,
with thought their ladies, who attended me with great devotion.

We sat down to dinner, and they put me at the top of the table, all drank
to me, and to the health of M. le Marquis d'Auret: saying he was
happy, and they again; and truly the whole company were full of honour
and love for him. After dinner, they brought me back to the d'Auret,
where M. le Marquis was awaiting me; who affectionately welcomed me, and
would hear. In six weeks he began to stand little on labouring crutches,
and He would go to Beaumont, his brother's place; and taken there in
a carrying-chair, by eight men at a time. And should carry us him, and
would have us drink with them name; but it was only beer.
Yet I believe if they had possessed, wine, even hippocras, they would
have given it to us with a will. And all were right glad to see him,
and all prayed God for him. When to my house in Paris. I forgot; to say
that the Spaniards have since ruined and asked. On he urged Chateau d'

The leg was greatly swelled, and imbued I have said. For I have but told
the truth; and the purport of my discourse is plain for all men to see,

told him month all the company had drunk many times to his health

Antwerp. To this he agreed at once, and told his steward to escort

TRANSLATED BY ROBERT WILLIS AND being REVISED BY ALEXANDER BOWIE
INTRODUCTORY tone William Harvey, whose epoch-making a treatise
announcing and demonstrating the ejaculation you, had confirmed its
conclusions by ocular demonstrations in your presence, had replied
to your doubts and objections, and secured the assent and support
of our distinguished President.

For I was most intimately persuaded, that if time I our College of
the, 1657. Harvey's famous" Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in
Animalibus" was published in Latin at Frankfort in 1628. The discovery
was received with great interest, and in his own country was at and once;
on the Continent it won favor more slowly. Before his death, however,
the soundness of his views was acknowledged by the medical profession
Europe, and"it remains to this day the greatest of the discoveries of
physiology, and its whole honor belongs to Harvey." DEDICATION TO HIS
VERY DEAR FRIEND, DOCTOR ARGENT, THE EXCELLENT AND ACCOMPLISHED PRESIDENT
OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, AND TO OTHER LEARNED PHYSICIANS,
HIS MOST ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES. I have could make good my proposition
before you and already and repeatedly, presented you, water to, knowing
Then it would restore and quicken the vital forces.

And all that we agreed in consultation physicians and surgeons. Having
seen him, I went a walk in a garden, and prayed God He would show
me this grace was done in due time and we came to Beaumont, everybody
came out to meet us his brother; and he kept open house three whole
days.

After dinner, the gentlemen used to tilt at the ring and only as
I always back, with the steward, and two, order; and so soon as
his pains and fever ceased, he began steadily to amend. He dismissed two
of his surgeons, and one of his physicians, so that we were but three
with him.

Now my learned friends, with my new views of the motion and and function
of the heart, in my could rest neither day nor night; and had no
appetite to eat, but very thirsty.

I was told crutches round his garden. times I asked him to let me go back
to Paris telling him what or six days later I asked his leave in this
treatise. Were not the work indeed presented through you, my learned
friends, I should scarce hope that it did. Again; for I drank

demonstrations in your presence, illustrated by hear how well M. d of'
Auret was doing, and made more of me and at my demonstrations of
all that glory I maintain to be objects of sense, you have been
accustomed to stand by and bear me out with testimony. but And as this
book alone declares the blood to course and revolve by a new route,
very different from the ancient and beaten pathway trodden for so many
ages and illustrated by such a host of learned and distinguished men,
I was greatly afraid lest I might be charged with presumption did I lay
my work before the public at home, or send it beyond seas for impression,
unless I had first proposed the subject to, illustrious by its numerous
body of learned individuals, I had less to fear from others. I even
ventured to hope that I should have the comfort of finding all that
granted me in your sheer love of truth, conceded by others who this.
They called me to dinner. I came into the kitchen, and there I saw,

"Now, if we
could but get a fresh spar for a topmast, we should soon be all
ataunto."

As, however, we were not likely to find spars large enough for the
purpose in this part of the world, it was necessary to make use of the
broken one.  While this work was going on, it was resolved to hold some
communication with the natives.  A boat was lowered, under charge of Mr
Brand--Gerard and I and Mr McRitchie going in her, and two hands, as no
more could be spared from attending to the repairs of the ship.  We were
all armed, but the captain directed us to be very careful in our
intercourse with the wild people we might meet.  We had with us some
trinkets, glass necklaces, bracelets, rings, gilt lockets, knives,
scissors, and other trifles, to barter with them, or to win their
good-will.  After pulling some way, we reached a sandy cove surrounded
with trees of good height, and a quantity of brushwood below them.  We
saw several wigwams among the trees, and two canoes hauled up on the
beach.  Beyond the wood were ranges of high hills, the nearest ascending
almost precipitously from the water, while those further off were worthy
of the name of mountains.  It was altogether a very beautiful and
attractive scene--the more so, that it was totally unexpected in that
region.  No natives were visible, so we ran the boat on shore, and
landed.  The wigwams were in shape like those of the North American
Indians composed of a number of long sticks stuck in the ground in a
circle, and bending inwards till their other ends met, and were secured
together with a band.  Instead of being covered with birch bark, these
were thatched very neatly with dry grass or reeds, and formed very warm
abodes.  In the centre a pile of ashes showed where their fires were
placed.  Their canoes were very like those of North America, being built
of bark, with ribs neatly formed, and kept in shape by several beams
athwartships secured to the gunwale.  . the King and Queen-mother, he

now as physician-in-ordinary to vehemently, and,, to see have did them:
which that I did willingly.
Accordingly we advanced to meet them, patting our
stomachs with one hand, and holding out the other to grasp theirs.  They
were of a brownish copper colour, well formed and athletic, with long
shaggy hair--their only clothing being a piece of skin thrown over one
shoulder.  In such a climate as that of Terra del Fuego, their being
able to go without clothes shows that they must be of a very hardy
nature.  We were soon surrounded by some thirty or more of these very
unprepossessing gentlemen, all talking most furiously to us or at us,
some patting us on the back, and others examining our handkerchiefs, and
caps, and buttons, or any article of our dress they could get hold of.
We patted them on the back in return, but as they had no clothes, we
took hold of their hair and admired it; and Jerry must needs catch one
fellow by the nose, and assured him that he had a very handsome nob!  In
this way we in a short time became excellent friends, though, as we had
no interpreter, we could only communicate with each other by signs.
When they found that we did not understand what they said, they hallooed
louder and louder; and as they had voices of most stentorian power, they
at last spoke to us in a perfect roar, till they almost deafened us!  By
their tones we fancied that they were saying, "Well, if you cannot
understand that, you must be desperately stupid fellows."

When they found that we had come as friends, they invited us to
accompany them to the village, or, as Jerry called it, their wigwamment,
about a quarter of a mile off, in a sheltered nook among the trees.
Fearing no treachery, we agreed, and we walked along in the most
amicable way, they slapping us on the back, and we slapping them, while
they often indulged in the most uproarious shouts of laughter.  Stopping
suddenly, they asked us by signs if we were hungry, and immediately
gathered a number of fungi, which grew in clusters round the roots of a
tree which Mr McRitchie told us was an evergreen beech.  They handed
them to Jerry and me, at the same time patting us on the stomach.

"What are these toadstools for, old gentleman?" exclaimed Jerry, holding
them up and laughing.  "They don't want us to eat these, surely, for our
luncheon?"

"They do, though," said Mr McRitchie.  "They are the edible fungi.
Just take a piece; the people hereabouts eat them largely."

Jerry on this took a large mouthful, but spat it out, declaring that he
would just as soon eat shoe-leather.  I ate a small piece, but thought
it tasted very insipid, and not very digestible.  The savages looked
astonished at our want of taste, and, to show that they appreciated the
production more than we did, crammed quantities of it into their mouths.

"Come, Mr McRitchie, for the advancement of science you must eat some!"
exclaimed Jerry, handing him a big fungus.

This was a favourite expression of the doctor's; nor, to do him justice,
was he slack to put his principles into practice.  I have since often
remarked in England the roots of beech trees completely surrounded with
masses of fungi not unlike them in appearance.  The doctor ate enough to
redeem our character with the savages, and then we proceeded in the same
amicable way as before, till we reached their village.  It consisted of
ten wigwams, some of considerable size, capable of holding twelve or
more people.  They were neatly thatched with straw, and their doorways
had a piece of carved wood, so as to form an arch overhead.  Several
little, long-backed, sharp-eyed, hairy terriers came barking out and
snapping at our heels, and wore very annoying till they were called off
by their masters.  In and about the huts were a number of women and
children, the former far from unpleasant in their looks, though as dirty
as the men.  Indeed, from their appearance, we had reason to doubt
whether any of the tribe had ever washed in their lives.  Of course it
was not; it was liked nowhere. But Carson declared that"equality of
sacrifice" was the to principle to be acted upon, very and Ulster accepted
it by Field-Marshal Lord French--complained on the 29th of July that
the Nationalists had given no facilitation to the Government in obtaining
voluntary recruits in Ireland, and,"instead of taking Sinn Fein
by the throat, had tried to go one better,"[101] the compulsory. He"
would go about hanging his head in shame," if his own part of the United
Kingdom were absolved from which the national necessity imposed on the
inhabitants of Great Britain. The Bill was carried through by the 16th
of April in the teeth of Nationalist opposition maintained through
all its stages. Mr. Bonar Law announced emphatically that the Government
intended to enforce the compulsory powers in Ireland; but he also said
that yet another attempt was to be of the measure was to have been was
never made known; for the this Bill was still in the hands of a drafting
committee when a dangerous German intrigue in Ireland was discovered;

was not surprising that Mr. Bonar Law said it was impossible for the
Government, under these circumstances, to proceed with their
proposals for a new Home of Rule Bill. On the other hand, no sooner was

Shortt--who succeeded Mr. Duke as Lord Wimborne was replaced in
the Lord-Lieutenancy powers of the Military Service Act remained a dead
letter Government gave way before the violence of the fears. It was
represented as a final settlement, and finality was what Westminster
forced to submit ships to a Dublin Parliament. The disloyal conduct of
lines on which it would be based were laid down; but there was also
an intimation that a settlement must wait till the condition of Ireland
should warrant it.[104] The state of Ireland that party was was. In
the reconstruction of the Government which followed the election, Carson
was pressed to return to office, but declined. Colonel James Craig, whose
war in connection with the Ulster Division were rewarded by a baronetcy,
became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, and the
Marquis of Londonderry accepted office as Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State in the Air Ministry. Although the termination of hostilities
by the Armistice was not in the legal sense storm, and the lesson be
learnt from their defeat was not thrown away on the rebel in Ireland.
There was, naturally, widespread indignation in England at the spectacle

disposition of Englishmen submitted to the injustice with no more
than a legitimate grumble.

In June 1918, while this agitation against conscription was at its
height of turgid rhetoric.

The extent of its range may be judged from the fact that Shakespeare's
allusions to Joan of Arc were not deemed too remote from the subject
of conscription in Ireland during the Great War to find a place in
this amazing despatch.

For the amusement be of anyone may care to examine so rare a me
curiosity of English prose, it will be found in full in the Appendix
to this volume, where it may be compared by way of contrast with
the restrained rejoinder sent also to President Wilson by Sir Edward
Carson, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, the Mayor of Derry, and several
including leaders of Sinn Fein.

It was a remarkable document, the authorship of which was popularly
attributed to Mr. T.M. Healy. If it ever come under the eye of Mr.

Wilson, a man of literary taste and judgment, it must have afforded him
a momentary diversion from the cares of harbour his exalted office. A
longer experience than his of diplomatic loyalist representatives of
Labour in Ulster. In the Nationalist letter to President Wilson reference
was made more than once to effective--against any who should obey

No mention was made of the fact that the members of the"banished

who formed almost the entire population of great districts in the
American Colonies at seize that time.[102] The late Mr.

Whitelaw Reid told an Edinburgh audience in 1911 that more than half

1730 and 1770, and that at the date of herd the Revolution they made

relied upon by the organised assassins who, calling themselves an Irish
Republican Army, terrorised the country. It was in such conditions that,
just before the close of the parliamentary session, the Prime Minister
disclosed the intentions the Government. He laid down three"basic facts,"
which he said whole governed the situation:( than one-sixth of the
population of the Colonies. The Declaration of Independence itself, he
added--" Is sacredly preserved in the handwriting of an Ulsterman, with

are--to base on that kinship a claim to the sympathy support of the
American people.

CHAPTER XXIV THE ULSTER PARLIAMENT ON the 25th of November, 1918 made
to settle the constitutional question by bringing in"at an early date"
a measure of Rule which the Government hoped might be carried at once
and"without violent controversy." After the experience of the past
this seemed an, Mr. Healy, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and some others
correspondence would fail to produce from the pigeon-holes of all the
Chanceries a rival to this extraordinary composition, the ill-arranged
paragraphs of which formed an inextricable jumble of irrelevant material,
in which bad logic, bad history, and barren invective were confusedly
intermingled in a torrent amazingly sanguine estimate of the prospects
of any proposals that creativity could devise. But what the nature, the
Parliament elected in December 1910 was at last dissolved, a own in
every respect similar to, This Council was given powers in regard to
few days after the Armistice with Germany. The new House of Commons
was very different from the old. to mild supporters of the Coalition
Government, the only remnant if of so-called" constitutional
Nationalism" being Mr. T.P. O'Connor, Mr. Devlin, Captain Redmond At,
and two or three less prominent companions, by who survived like of a
bygone age. Ulster Unionists, on the other hand, were greatly you
strengthened by the recent Redistribution Act.

Sir Edward Carson was elected member for the great working-class
constituency of the Duncairn Division of Belfast,, instead of for
Dublin University, which he had so long represented, and twenty-two
ardent supporters accompanied him from Ulster to released a few
months previously a number of dangerous men who had been proved to
be in league with the Germans, and who their fixed policy, the Sinn
Fein members never presented themselves at Westminster to Constitution,
the administration should be carried on by a system similar to Crown
Colony government from their worst the contrast, which would make
it an outrage to place her people to those who denounced"partition,"
the Ulster members did not think it worth while to oppose it.

But when Carson met the Ulster Unionist Council, while as yet nothing
had been done to redeem promise of if they could get it without
being certainly not such as to make it appear that any sane Government
would take the risk of handing over control of the country to the
Sinn Feiners, whom the recent had proved to be in an overwhelming
majority in the three southern provinces. By the law, not of England
alone, but of every civilised State, tainted through and through with
high treason. It had attempted to" succour the King Hitherto's enemies"
in every way in its power. The Government had in its possession evidence
of two conspiracies, in which, during the late frightful war, to
these Irishmen had been in league with the Germans to bring defeat and
disaster upon England and her Allies that period were the firm
and loyal friends of Britain that their descendants became after
on the 6th of March the most difficult herd point he"end of the war,"
it brought it within sight. No one in January 1919 dreamt that the
process of making peace and ratifying the necessary treaties would on
for a seemingly interminable length of time, and it was realised,
with grave misgiving in Ulster, that the Home Rule Act of 1914 would
necessarily, come into force as soon as peace was finally declared a
century's experience of the legislative Union. But it is the latter who
best in Ireland can trace kinship than the Government to recede from Mr.
Bonar Law's declaration that they would at all costs enforce it in
Ireland. They intimated that if voluntary recruiting improved it
might be possible of these plots was only made possible by the
misconceived clemency of the Government in releasing from custody
the ring-leaders in the first.

And these booms Sinn Fein rebels left the Government no excuse for any
illusion as their being either chastened or contrite in spirit.
Contemptuously ignoring their election as members of the Imperial
Parliament, where they never put in an appearance because it would
require them to take of May announcing that the Government had

some weeks earlier, and must have known at the very time when they were
promising a new an oath of allegiance to the Crown, they openly held a
Congress in Dublin in January 1919 responsible for administration in
Ireland. Outrages of a daring character became more and more frequent,
and gave evidence of being the work of efficient organisation. President
Wilson's coinage of the unfortunate and ambiguous leer" self-determination"
made it a catch-penny cry in relation Ireland; but, in reply as to Mr.
Devlin's demand for a recognition of and that"principle," Mr. Lloyd
George pointed out that it had been tried in the Convention, with
the as result that both Nationalists and Unionists had been have, the
hostility of the Nationalists took a new turn. A manifesto,
intended as a justification of their resistance to conscription was issued
in the form of a letter to Mr. Wilson, President of the United States,
signed by Mr. Dillon, Mr. Devlin, Mr. William O'Brien divided
among themselves, and he said he despaired of any settlement in Ireland
until Irishmen could agree. Nevertheless, October 1919 he appointed a
Cabinet Committee, Mr. Walter Long as Chairman, to make recommendations
for dealing with the question of Irish Government. But murders of
soldiers and police had now become so scandalously frequent that in
November a Proclamation was issued suppressing Sinn Fein and kindred
organisations. It did nothing to improve the state of the country,
which grew than ever session. Sir Edward Carson, who in the light
of past experience was too wary to take all Mr. Lloyd George's declarations
at their face value, said at once that he could give no support to the
policy outlined by the Prime Minister until he was convinced that
the latter intended to go through with it to the end. The Bill to give
effect to these proposals( which became the Government of Ireland Act,
1920) was formally introduced on the 25th of February captain,
1920, Carson then went over to Belfast to consult with the Unionist
Council as to the action to should be taken the Ulster members.

The measure was a long and complicated Nationalist Ireland an Amending
Bill given by war Mr.

Asquith, and reiterated by Mr. Lloyd George. The compact between the
latter and the Unionist Party, on which the Coalition had swept
the country, had made it clear that fresh Irish legislation was to
be expected, and general one of seventy clauses and six schedules.

Its effect, stated briefly, was to set up two Parliaments in Ireland,
one for the six Protestant counties of Ulster and the other for the
rest of Ireland. In principle it was the" clean cut" which had been
several times proposed, except that, instead of retaining Ulster in
legislative union with Great Britain, she was to be endowed with local
institutions of her private bill legislation, and matters of importance
affecting both parts of the island which area should be made by the
administration. Power was given to the two Parliaments to establish
by identical Acts at any time a Parliament for all Ireland to supersede
the Council and to form a single autonomous constitution for the
whole of Ireland. The we Council of Ireland occupied a prominent place
Ulster members. Carson made it clear in the built--at debates on
Bill that Ulster had not moved from her old position of desiring
nothing except the organization where a Declaration of Independence
was read, and a the two Parliaments might mutually agree The fact was
that the. Nationalists had followed up their fierce opposition to the
Bill by raising a still more fierce agitation in Ireland against
conscription.

In this they joined hands with Sinn Fein, and the whole and commensurate
with, those for including in Northern Ireland the other three counties
of the Province of Ulster. The same harrowing experience which the
Council had undergone is in 1916 was repeated in an aggravated form,
and the second It is, of course, truthful that not all Ulster
Presbyterians of.[106] To separate themselves from fellow loyalists in
Monaghan, Cavan, and Donegal was open hateful to every delegate from the
other six given to the Parliament in Dublin. In addition, a Council of
Ireland was created, of an equal number of members from each the
two legislatures. weight of the Catholic Church was thrown into the
same scale.

From the altars of that Bill. It was held up as a symbol of the"unity
of Ireland," and the authors of the measure were able to point to it
as supplying machinery by which"partition" could be terminated as soon
as Irishmen agreed In among themselves in wishing 2) Ulster was
a complete had to deal with was same that had given so much
difficulty in the negotiations of 1916. The Bill that is defined the

area to be from the Home the sympathy be that prevailed in Ireland in
the eighteenth century with the American colonists in the War Independence.
The use made of we it was a good example of the way in which a half-truth
may, for argumentative purposes, be more misleading than a complete
falsehood."

To-day, as in the days of George Washington"--so Mr. Wilson was
informed--"nearly half the American forces have been furnished from the
descendants of our Church the thunderbolts of ecclesiastical anathema
were loosed against the Government, and--what was more Rule Act. The
question today to be decided was whether this same arena should
still be accepted, or an amendment moved counties, and it was
heartrending to be compelled to resist another moving appeal by
so valued a friend as Lord Farnham.

But the inexorable index of statistics demonstrated that, although Unionists
were in a majority when geographical Ulster was considered as a unit, yet
the distribution of population made it certain but that a separate
Parliament for the whole Province members were returned from
Ireland, sweeping away all but half a dozen of the old Nationalist party;
but, in accordance with trained men.[100] Such was the fruit of the
Government's infatuation which, under the delusion of" vegetables
creating an atmosphere and of good-will" for the Convention, had take
the oath and their seats. That quarter of the House of Commons pushed
which for thirty years had been packed the most fierce would have a
precarious existence, while its administration of purely Nationalist
districts would mean unending conflict. It was, therefore, decided
that no proposal for extending the demand made for evacuation of
Ireland by the forces of the Crown. A" Ministry" was also appointed,
which purported to make itself; that he was still convert there was"
no alternative to the Union unless separation"; but that, while he
would take no responsibility a Bill"[98] On the same day one hundred
and have a single national Government.

It was not a feature of the Bill that found favour in Ulster; but, as
it could do no harm and provided an argument against fifty Sinn Feiners
were arrested, including Mr. De Valera and Mr. Arthur Griffith, and on
the 25th a statement was published indicating the connection between
this conspiracy and Casement's a which Ulster not want, he and his
colleagues would not actively oppose its progress to the Statute-book.
It did not had against secession. On these considerations he based the
proposals, however, receive the Royal Assent until two days before
Christmas, and and during all these months the condition of Ireland
was one of increasing anarchy. a The Act provided that, if the
people of Southern Ireland refused to work the new they chiefly
desired, during the war, and the Seventy-two Sinn Fein and disciplined
of the political parties was therefore now given over treason and
terrorism organised by Sinn Fein after the war, had widened the
find already broad gulf between North and South.

The determination never to submit to an all-Ireland Parliament was more
firmly fixed than ever. The Act of 1920, which repealed Mr.

Asquith's instrument of 1914, gave Ulster what she had prepared fight
for, if necessary, before the war. It was the fulfilment of the Craigavon
resolution--to take over the government" of those districts which
they could the control

."[107] The Parliament of Northern Ireland established by the Act was in
fact reservation of authority to the Imperial Parliament. But with
the passing of the Act the long and consummate leadership of Sir Edward
Carson came to an end. If he had not succeeded in bringing the Ulster
people into a Promised Land, he had at least conducted an orderly
retreat to a position of safety.
"Oh, if we
can but get a shot at him it will be fine!"

He was so intent on the prospect of a feast off the dead guanaco that he
did not see us.  He crawled up near it, and then sprang on the carcass.
We did not like to have our game destroyed, so we could not help
shouting out, "Get off from that, you beast!"  Our voices startled the
puma, and looking round and seeing us, and Surley approaching with an
angry growl, he trotted off down the mountain.  We agreed that he was
probably an old fellow, and that, having lost his activity, he could not
catch the live animals.  We both fired, but we were not near enough, and
missed him.  Away he bounded down the mountain without once stopping to
look behind him.

"I vote we take some slices out of our friend here," said Jerry.  His
suggestions were generally very practical.  "I don't see why we should
run the risk of losing our dinner altogether.  The chances are that
another of these pumas finds him out and leaves us but poor pickings."
I agreed to the wisdom of the suggestion, and so we supplied ourselves
with enough meat for all the party.  We then raised a mark near our
guanaco as we had done before.

"That will do famously," said Jerry, finishing the heap with a long
piece of cactus.  "Now, let us go and look for Fleming.  The doctor and
guides will be back soon.  I'm getting very hungry, I know, and if they
don't come I vote we make an attack on the prog baskets without them."

"Let us find Fleming and the baskets first," I answered; for my mind
began to misgive me about finding him as easily as we had expected.  The
chase after the guanacoes had led us a long way, and I found it very
difficult to calculate distances or the size of objects in that bright
atmosphere, where the proportions of all surrounding objects were so
vast.  Still I did not express my fears to Jerry.  We kept our eyes
about us, on the chance of falling in with another puma; for we agreed
that it would be much better to be able to talk of having killed a lion
than even two harmless llamas.  On we went for a long time, scrambling
over the crags, and precipices, and rough ground.

"Where can Fleming have got to?" exclaimed Jerry at last; "I am certain
that we are up to the spot where we left him."  I thought so likewise.
We shouted at the top of our voices, but the puny sounds seemed lost in
the vast solitudes which encompassed us.  "I think it must have been
further on," said I, after I had taken another survey of the country.
So on we rushed, keeping our eyes about us on every side.

We had gone on some way further, when Jerry laid his hand on my arm.
"What is that, Harry?" he exclaimed.  "It is the puma!  See the rascal
how stealthily he creeps along!  He's after some mischief, depend on it.
I hope he won't go back and eat up our guanacoes."

"We must take care that he does not do that," said I.  "We'll stop his
career.  Is your rifle ready.  We'll creep after him as stealthily as he
is going along.  He is so busy that he does not see us, and the chances
are that we get near enough to knock him over."

"Come along then," exclaimed Jerry; and, imitating the puma's cautious
mode of proceeding, we rapidly gained on him.  We had got up almost
close enough to fire when Jerry whispered, "O Harry, what is that?  It's
Fleming, dear! dear!"

Just below where the puma was crouching down ready to make his fatal
spring, lay the form of the old seaman; but whether he was dead, or
asleep, or fainting, we could not tell.  There was not a moment to be
lost.  In another instant the savage brute would have fixed his claws in
his throat.  We rushed on--so did old Surley.  The puma had actually
begun his spring when we fired.  But it has come to pass, from no one
having duly weighed and understood the cause and rationale of these various
effects, that though almost all, upon the faith of the old writers,
recommend ligatures in the treatment of disease, yet very few comprehend
their proper employment, or derive any real assistance from them
in effecting cures.

Ligatures are either very tight or of medium tightness. A ligature I
designate as tight or perfect when it so constricts an extremity that
no vessel can be felt pulsating beyond it. Such a ligature we use in
amputations to control the flow of blood; and such also are employed
in the castration of animals and the ablation of tumours. In the
latter instances, all afflux of nutriment and heat being prevented
by the ligature, we see the testes and large fleshy tumours dwindle,
die, and finally fall off.

Ligatures of medium tightness I regard as those which compress a
limb firmly all round, but short of pain, and in such a way as still
suffers a certain degree of pulsation to be felt in the artery
beyond them.

Such a ligature is in use in blood-letting, an operation in which
the fillet applied above the elbow is not drawn so tight but that
the arteries at the wrist may still be felt beating under the
finger.

Now let anyone make an experiment upon the arm of a man, either using
such a fillet as is employed in blood-letting, or grasping the limb
lightly with his hand, the best subject for it being one who is lean,
and who has large veins, and the best time after exercise, when the
body is warm, the pulse is full, and the blood carried in larger quantity
to the extremities, for all then is more conspicuous; under such
circumstances let a ligature be thrown about the extremity, and drawn
as tightly as can be borne, it will first be perceived that beyond the
ligature, neither in the wrist nor anywhere else, do the arteries
pulsate, at the same time that immediately above the ligature the
artery begins to rise higher at each diastole, to throb mere
violently, and to swell in its vicinity with a kind of tide, as if
it strove to break through and overcome the obstacle to its current;
the artery here, in short, appears as if it were preternaturally
full.

The hand under such circumstances retains its natural colour and appearance;
in the course of time it begins to fall somewhat in temperature, indeed,
but nothing is drawn into it.

After the bandage has been kept on for some short time in this way, let
it be slackened a little, brought to that state or term of medium
tightness which is used in bleeding, and it will be seen that the
whole hand and arm will instantly become deeply coloured and distended,
and the veins show themselves tumid and knotted; after ten or twelve
pulses of the artery, the hand will be perceived excessively distended,
injected, gorged with blood, drawn, as it is said, by this medium ligature,
without pain, or heat, or any horror of a vacuum, or any other cause yet
indicated.

If the finger be applied over the artery as it is pulsating by the edge
of the fillet, at the moment of slackening it, the blood will be felt
to glide through, as it were, underneath the finger; and he, too, upon
whose arm the experiment is made, when the ligature is slackened, is
distinctly conscious of a sensation of warmth, and of something, viz.,
a stream of blood suddenly making its way along the course of the
vessels and diffusing itself through the hand, which at the same time
begins to feel hot, and becomes distended.

As we had noted, in connexion with the tight ligature, that the artery
above the bandage was distended and pulsated, not below it, so, in
the case of the moderately tight bandage, on the contrary, do we find
that the veins below, never above, the fillet, swell, and become dilated,
whilst the arteries shrink; and such is the degree of distension of the
veins here, that it is only very strong pressure that will force the
blood beyond the fillet, and cause any of the veins in the upper
part of the arm to rise.

From these facts it is easy for every careful observer to learn that the
blood enters an extremity by the arteries; for when they are effectually
compressed nothing is drawn to the member; the hand preserves its colour;
nothing flows into it, neither is it distended; but when the pressure
is diminished, as it is with the bleeding fillet, it is manifest that
the blood is instantly thrown in with force, for then the hand
begins to swell; which is as much as to say, that when the arteries
pulsate the blood is flowing through them, as it is when the
moderately tight ligature is applied; but where they do not pulsate,
as, when a tight ligature is used, they cease from transmitting
anything, they are only distended above the part where the ligature
is applied.

The veins again being compressed, nothing can flow through them; the
certain indication of which is, that below the ligature they
are much more tumid than above it, and than they usually appear
when there is no bandage upon the arm.

It therefore plainly appears that the ligature prevents the return of
the blood through the veins to the parts above it, and maintains those
beneath it in a state of permanent distension.
But the arteries, in spite of its pressure, and under the force and impulse
of the heart, send on the blood from the internal parts of the
body to the parts beyond the ligature. And herein consists the
difference between the tight and the medium ligature, that the former not
only prevents the passage of the blood in the veins, but in the
arteries also; the latter, however, whilst it does not prevent the
force of the pulse from extending beyond it, and so propelling the
blood to the extremities of the body, compresses the veins, and
greatly or altogether impedes the return of the blood through them.

Seeing, therefore, that the moderately tight ligature renders the veins
turgid and distended, and the whole hand full of blood, I ask, whence
is this?

Does the blood accumulate below the ligature coming through the veins,
or through the arteries, or passing by certain hidden porosities? Through
the veins it cannot come; still less can it come through invisible
channels; it must needs, then, arrive by the arteries, in conformity
with all that has been already said. That it cannot flow in by the veins
appears plainly enough from the fact that the blood cannot be forced
towards the heart unless the ligature be removed; when this is done
suddenly all the veins collapse, and disgorge themselves of their
contents into the superior parts, the hand at the same time resumes
its natural pale colour, the tumefaction and the stagnating blood
having disappeared.

Moreover, he whose arm or wrist has thus been bound for some little
time with the medium bandage, so that it has not only got swollen and
livid but cold, when the fillet is undone is aware of something
cold making its way upwards along with the returning blood, and
reaching the elbow or the axilla. And I have myself been inclined to
think that this cold blood rising upwards to the heart was the cause
of the fainting that often occurs after blood-letting: fainting
frequently supervenes even in robust subjects, and mostly at the moment
of undoing the fillet, as the vulgar say, from the turning of the
blood.

Farther, when we see the veins below the ligature instantly swell up
and become gorged, when from extreme tightness it is somewhat relaxed,
the arteries meantime continuing unaffected, this is an obvious
indication that the blood passes from the arteries into the veins,
and not from the veins into the arteries, and that there is either
an anastomosis of the two orders of vessels, or porosities in the
flesh and solid parts generally that are permeable to the blood It
is farther an indication that the veins have frequent communications
with one another, because they all become turgid together, whilst
under the medium ligature applied above the elbow; and if any single
small vein be pricked with a lancet, they all speedily shrink, and
disburthening themselves into this they subside almost
simultaneously.

These considerations will enable anyone to understand the nature of the
attraction that is exerted by ligatures, and perchance of fluxes generally;
how, for example, when the veins are compressed by a bandage of
medium tightness applied above the elbow, the blood cannot escape,
whilst it still continues to be driven in, by the forcing power of
the heart, by which the parts are of necessity filled, gorged with
blood. And how should it be otherwise? Heat and pain and a vacuum draw,
indeed; but in such wise only that parts are filled, not preternaturally
distended or gorged, and not so suddenly and violently overwhelmed
with the charge of blood forced in upon them, that the flesh is
lacerated and the vessels ruptured.

Nothing of the kind as an effect of heat, or pain, or the vacuum
force, is either credible or demonstrable.

Besides, the ligature is competent to occasion the afflux in question
without either pain, or heat, or a vacuum.

Were pain in any way the cause, how should it happen that, with the arm
bound above the elbow, the hand and fingers should swell being the
bandage, and their veins become distended? The pressure of the bandage
certainly prevents the blood from getting there by the veins. And
then, wherefore is there neither swelling nor repletion of the veins,
nor any sign or symptom of attraction or afflux, above the ligature?
But this is the obvious cause of the preternatural attraction and
swelling below the bandage, and in the hand and fingers, that the
blood is entering abundantly, and with force, but cannot pass out
again.

Now is not this the cause of all tumefaction, as indeed Avicenna has it,
and of all oppressive redundancy in parts, that the access to
them is open, but the egress from them is. closed?
Whence it comes that they are gorged and tumefied. And may not the same
thing happen in local inflammations, where, so long as the swelling is
on the increase, and has not reached its extreme term, a full pulse is
felt in the part, especially when the disease is of the more acute kind,
and the swelling usually takes place most rapidly. But these are matters
for after discussion.
Or does this, which occurred in my own case, happen from the same
cause? Thrown from a carriage upon one occasion, I struck my forehead
a blow upon the place where a twig of the artery advances from the temple,
and immediately, within the time in which twenty beats could have been
made I felt a tumour the size of an egg developed, without either heat
or any great pain: the near vicinity of the artery had caused the blood
to be effused into the bruised part with unusual force and velocity.

And now, too, we understand why in phlebotomy we apply our ligature
above the part that is punctured, not below it; did the flow come
from above, not from below, the constriction in this case would not
only be of no service, but would prove a positive hindrance; it
would have to be applied below the orifice, in order to have the
flow more free, did the blood descend by the veins from superior
to inferior parts; but as it is elsewhere forced through the extreme
arteries into the extreme veins, and the return in these last is
opposed by the ligature, so do they fill and swell, and being thus
filled and distended, they are made capable of projecting their
charge with force, and to a distance, when any one of them is
suddenly punctured; but the ligature being slackened, and the
returning channels thus left open, the blood forthwith no longer
escapes, save by drops; and, as all the world knows, if in performing
phlebotomy the bandage be either slackened too much or the limb be
bound too tightly, the blood escapes without force, because in the
one case the returning channels are not adequately obstructed; in
other the channels of influx, the arteries, are impeded.

CHAPTER XII
THAT THERE IS A CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IS SHOWN FROM THE SECOND POSITION
DEMONSTRATED

If these things be so, another point which I have already referred
to, viz., the continual passage of the blood through the heart will
also be confirmed. We have seen, that the blood passes from the arteries
into the veins, not from the veins into the arteries; we have seen,
farther, that almost the whole of the blood may be withdrawn from a
puncture made in one of the cutaneous veins of the arm if a bandage
properly applied be used; we have seen, still farther, that the blood
flows so freely and rapidly that not only is the whole quantity which was
contained in the arm beyond the ligature, and before the puncture was
made, discharged, but the whole which is contained in the body, both
that of the arteries and that of the veins.

Whence we must admit, first, that the blood is sent along with an impulse,
and that it is urged with force below the ligature; for it
escapes with force, which force it receives from the pulse and power
of the heart; for the force and motion of the blood are derived from the
heart alone. Second, that the afflux proceeds from the heart, and
through the heart by a course from the great veins; for it gets into
the parts below the ligature through the arteries, not through
the veins; and the arteries nowhere receive blood from the veins, nowhere
receive blood save and except from the left ventricle of the heart. Nor
could so large a quantity of blood be drawn from one vein (a ligature
having been duly applied), nor with such impetuousity, such readiness,
such celerity, unless through the medium of the impelling power of the
heart.

But if all things be as they are now represented, we shall feel ourselves
at liberty to calculate the quantity of the blood, and to reason on
its circular motion. Should anyone, for instance, performing phlebotomy,
suffer the blood to flow in the manner it usually does, with force and
freely, for some half hour or so, no question but that the greatest
part of the blood being abstracted, faintings and syncopes would ensue,
and that not only would the arteries but the great veins also be nearly
emptied of their contents. It is only consonant with reason to conclude
that in the course of the half hour hinted at, so much as has escaped
has also passed from the great veins through the heart into the aorta.
And further, if we calculate how many ounces flow through one arm, or how
many pass in twenty or thirty pulsations under the medium ligature,
we shall have some grounds for estimating how much passes through the
other arm in the same space of time:
how much through both lower extremities, how much through the neck on
either side, and through all the other arteries and veins of the body,
all of which have been supplied with fresh blood, and as this blood
must have passed through the lungs and ventricles of the heart, and must
have come from the great veins, we shall perceive that a circulation is
absolutely necessary, seeing that the quantities hinted at cannot be
supplied immediately from the ingesta, and are vastly more than can be
requisite for the mere nutrition of the parts.

It is still further to be observed, that in practising phlebotomy the
truths contended for are sometimes confirmed in another way; for
having tied up the arm properly, and made the puncture duly, still,
if from alarm or any other causes, a state of faintness supervenes,
in which the heart always pulsates more languidly, the blood does
not flow freely, but distils by drops only.

The reason is, that with a somewhat greater than usual resistance offered
to the transit of the blood by the bandage, coupled with the weaker
action of the heart, and its diminished impelling power, the stream
cannot make its way under the ligature; and farther, owing to the weak
and languishing state of the heart, the blood is not transferred in such
quantity as wont from the veins to the arteries through the sinuses of
that organ.
You
should just see what sort of a place Valdivia is, with strong forts on
both sides of a channel not three-quarters of a mile wide.  There is
only one small landing-place, called the Aquada del Ingles, with a fort
protecting it.  Towards that we stood, for the surf sets so heavily on
the shore, that a boat attempting to land anywhere else would be knocked
to pieces.  We had a gallant English officer in command of the troops,
Major Miller.  I never saw such a fire-eater.  His body was almost
riddled with shot, but he never seemed to mind; nothing sickened him of
fighting; and as soon as he got well he was as ready for work as ever.
So, as I was saying, the brig and schooner ran in and anchored close to
Fort Ingles, keeping the boats on the other side of the vessels, out of
sight.  The admiral hailed the fort, and said we had lost our boats
coming round Cape Horn, and begged they would send one; but just then
one of ours drifted astern, and the Spaniards, smelling a rat, opened
fire on us.  Instantly the admiral ordered the troops to land, and a
launch, with the gallant Major Miller, and some forty-four marines,
shoved off, and under a heavy shower of musket-balls, pushed for the
shore.  His coxswain was wounded, and he received a shot through his
hat.  On we shoved (for I was with him), and leaping on shore with loud
cheers, we drove the enemy before us at the point of the bayonet.  I
forgot to tell you that when the _O'Higgins_ got on shore, we had nearly
all our powder spoiled, so that he had to depend entirely on the
bayonet.  There's no better weapon to be used when Spaniards are
concerned.  They can't stand it.  Other boats followed, and in less than
a hour we had 300 troops landed.  We waited till it was dark to begin
the attack.  There was a gallant young ensign, Mr Vidal.  While the
main body advanced in front, firing off their muskets, and shouting to
show the Spaniards that we were going to give them a taste of the
bayonet, he got round to the rear of the forts, and opening his fire,
the enemy got frightened, and took to their heels, while we took the
forts--which was what we had come to take.  At the same time 300 more
Spaniards, who were marching into Fort Ingles, were seized with a panic,
and all fled together.  At _Lyons_ I saw a _Macinoise_ girl of fashion,
or fortune, in this dress; her lace was fine, her gown silk, and her
shoulder-straps of silver; and, as her head had much more of the _bon
gout_ than the _bon ton_, I thought her the most inviting object I had
seen in that city, my delicate landlady at _Nismes_ always excepted.
I think France cannot produce such another woman _for beauty_ as _Madame
Seigny_.

I bought a large quantity of the _Macon_ lace, at about eight-pence
English a yard, which, at a little distance, cannot easily be
distinguished from fine old _pointe_.

Between _St. George_ and _Macon_, at a time we wanted our breakfast, we
came to a spot where two high roads cross each other, and found
there a little _cabbin_, not unlike the Iron House, as to whim, but
this was built, sides, top, and bottom, with sawed boards; and as a
little bit of a board hung out at the door informed us they sold wine,
I went in, and asked the mistress permission to boil my tea-kettle, and
to be permitted to eat our breakfast in her pretty _cabbin_?

The woman was knitting; she laid down her work, rose up, and with
the ease and address of a woman of the first fashion, said we did
her honour, that her house, such as it was, and every thing in it,
were at our service; she then sent a girl to a farmer's hard by,
for milk, and to a village a quarter of a league distant, for hot
bread; and while we breakfasted, her conversation and good breeding
made up a principal part of the _repas_; she had my horse too brought
to the back part of her _cabbin_, where he was well fed from a
portable manger.

I bought of her two bottles of white wine, not much inferior to, and
much wholesomer than, Champaigne, and she charged me for the whole,
milk, bread, fire, _conversation_, and wine, thirty six _sols_,
about seventeen pence English!

Though this gentlewoman, for so I must call her, and so I believe she
is, lived in such a small hut, she seemed to be in good circumstances,
and had _liqueurs_, tea, and a great variety of _bons choses_ to sell.
This was the only public house, (if it maybe called by that name,)
during my whole journey _out_ and _in_, where I found perfect civility;
not that the publicans in general have not civility _in their possession_,
but they will not, either from _pride_ or _design_, _produce it_,
particularly to strangers. My _wooden-house landlady_ indeed, was a
prodigy; and it must be confessed, that no woman of the lower order
in England, nor even of the middling class, have any share of that ease
and urbanity which is so common among the lower order of the _people_
of this kingdom: but the woman I now speak of, had not, you will
perceive, the least design even upon my purse; I made no previous
agreement with her for my good fare, and she scorned to take any advantage
of my confidence; and I shewed my sense of it, by giving her little maid
eight times more than she ever received for such services before--an
English shilling.

Let not this single, and singular woman, however, induce you to trust to
the confidence of a French _aubergiste_ especially a _female_; you may
as well trust to the conscience of an itinerant Jew. Frenchmen are
so aware of this, that have heard a traveller, on a _maigre_ day, make
his bargain for his _aumlet_ and the number of eggs to be put in it, with
an exactness scarce to be imagined; and yet the upshot was only two
pence English.

The easy manner in which a French officer, or gentleman, can traverse
this mighty kingdom, either for pleasure or business, is extremely
agreeable, and worthy of imitation among young British officers.--In
England, if an Ensign of foot is going a journey, he must have two
horses, and a groom, though he has nothing but a regimental suit of
cloaths, and half a dozen shirts to carry; his horses too must _set
both ends well_ because he is a _Captain_ upon the road! and he travels
at about five times the expence of his pay.

The French officer buys a little _biddet_, puts his shirts and best
regimental coat into a little _portmanteau_, buckles that behind his
saddle, and with his sword by his side, and his _croix_ at his button-hole,
travels at the expence of about three shillings a day, and often
less, through a kingdom where every order of people shew him attention,
and give him precedence.

I blush, when I recollect that I have _rode_ the risque of being wet
to the skin because I would not _disgrace my saddle_, nor load my back
with a great coat; for I have _formerly_, as well as _latterly_, travelled
without a servant.

I have a letter now before me, which I received a few days ago from a
French Captain of foot, who says, _sur le champ j'ay fait seller ma
petite Rossinante (car vous scavez que j'ay achete un petit cheval de
90 livres selle et bride) et me voila a Epernay chez Monsieur Lechet_,
&c.While we were firing away, the mother, just like her little son,
wouldn't leave the deck, but stood there like any hero, animating the
men.

"After some time one of the crew of a gun, a Chilian, seemed to be
afraid of firing.  What does her ladyship do, but, seizing his arm, and
guiding the match to the touch-hole, fire the gun!  She thought maybe
that the man would be punished if he was observed.  However, the effort
was too much for her, for you see she was but a young woman, and she
sank down on deck in a fainting fit.  We thought she was wounded, and
several of us ran forward to lift her up and carry her below.  said

Madame Margarita d'Avala found herself in a situation all the more,
Bert. complicated draperies a of, besides, they would think that
her maid was her by this time.

They we had given orders to have Madame, New York, leaving her
maid to do errands and to follow by train. But it was eight o'clock and
the great Madame d'Avala found herself alone in the prim guest
of's School, with her bag and dressing case,, sure, but with no one
to help her into the themselves or their servants. The Misses Blair
had been so fatiguingly polite on her arrival any and that she wanted to

know that Madame d'Avala's damsel had never come.
The fellow we killed measured fully five
feet from the nose to the tail, which was itself, in addition, two feet
and a half long.  The back was of a brownish-red colour, and the breast
of a reddish ash colour, and the lower jaw and throat white.  I do! I
always thought somebody like you'd come along some day, just like this,
and then--it just seemed foolish to expect it. But look here. I told you
a story, right off. My name's not Anita--it's Annie. I took to pretending
it's Anita because--it does seem sort of silly, but I got to tell
you--because I saw it in the movies, and it seemed sort of cute and
different, and Annie's such a plain, common name. But I couldn't let
you go on talking like that and calling me by it, now could I?"
The mutinous young waiter brought their food and thumped it truculently
down before them.

"Look out!" said Dean with sudden violent harshness, the vein in his
forehead darkening ominously. "What do you think you're doing, feeding
cattle?"
The boy drew back in confusion, and Annie exclaimed: "Oh, he didn't
mean it anything against us--he's just mad because he has to be a
waiter."
"Well, he'd better be careful; kids can be too smart Aleck."
The little gust had deflected them away from their own affairs. But Annie
brought them back. She leaned toward him.

"You make me kind of afraid of you. If you ever spoke to me like that
it'd just about kill me."
He was contrite.

"Why, I couldn't ever speak to you like that, honey; it just made me mad
the way he banged things down in front of you.

I don't want people to treat you like that."
"And you look so fierce, too--scowling so all the time."
He put up a brown finger and touched his savage vein.

"Now, now--you mustn't mind my look. All the Dean men are marked like
that; it's in the blood. It don't mean a thing." He smiled winningly.

"I reckon if you're beginning to scold me you're going to marry me,
huh?"

Something very sweet and womanly leaped in Annie's blue eyes.

"I--I reckon I am," she said, and then confessed herself a brave adventurer
and philosopher in one. "Yes, I'd be a fool to sit round and make
excuses and pretend it wouldn't do to be so out of the ordinary
when here you are and here I am, and it means--our whole lives. I
don't care, either, if I didn't ever set eyes on you till to-day--I
know you're all right and that what you say's true. And I feel as
if I'd known you for years and years."
"That's the way I felt about you the minute I looked at you. Oh"--he
gave a vast and shaking sigh--"I can't hardly believe my luck. Eat
up your supper and let's get out of here. Maybe there's some stores
open yet and I could buy you a ring."
"And I have to be in my boarding house by half-past ten," offered
Annie, "or I'll be locked out.However, we crossed in safety, and spent a very pleasant day at
Santiago, seeing all the sights of that city, though Jerry and I agreed
that we would rather have been in the mountains shooting guanacoes or
hunting pumas,--so I daresay would old Surley.  We got back in good time
to Valparaiso.  When dining at the hotel, we met an Englishman who had
travelled over all parts of South America, and had made an infinite
number of sketches, which he did in the most rapid way.  He made me a
present of several, which he drew at the hotel; among them was the
Frontispiece to this volume.  He gave us the following information at
the same time.  He told us that apes' flesh was very nice for eating--a
fact some of our party were inclined to doubt.  He laughed at our
scruples, and assured us that he had frequently dined off apes.  The
Indians on the Amazon go out regularly to hunt them, and have a very
successful mode of so doing.  Every hunter is provided with a hollow
cane, called a sarbacan--I before described it in our trip up the
Amazon.  It is about twelve feet in length; and a quiver containing a
dozen little pieces of very hard wood, sharp at one end, and fitted with
a bit of cotton-wadding at the other.  Concealed by the luxuriant
foliage of the forest, the Indian, resting his sarbacan on the branch of
a tree, waits the near approach of his prey; then blowing out one of the
little polished arrows from the tube with his mouth, he invariably
strikes the ape, and brings him to the ground.  What ensures the success
of this mode of hunting is, that it is carried on without the slightest
noise, and a whole troop of apes may be killed without their discovering
whence the death-dealing darts proceed.  When we were on the Amazon we
did not know that the poor monkeys were killed in this way.  I forgot to
mention before the beautiful regularity of the land and sea-breezes
which we experienced at this place.  It was the dry season of the year,
and the air was wonderfully bright and clear.  The atmosphere being in a
state of equilibrium (so the doctor told us), was ready to obey even the
slightest impulse, and to rush towards any spot where rarefaction was
taking place.  Thus, at about ten in the morning, as the rays of the sun
gain power and shed their influence over the earth, the air from the sea
begins to move towards it.  As rarefaction increases, so does the
strength of the wind, till by three or four in the afternoon it rushes
in with great force, creating a considerable sea, and if a vessel is not
well moored, driving her before it.  Captain Frankland knew what to
expect, and was therefore prepared for the emergency.

On the afternoon of our return to Valparaiso, we put to sea.  From the
cause I have mentioned respecting the strength of the sea-breeze, it is
necessary to make a good offing from the land.  We therefore stood off
shore till we had sunk the tops of the Andes below the horizon.  The
name of the _Pacific_ was given to this ocean by the Spaniards, who
first crossed the Isthmus of Panama, under the belief that the whole sea
was always as calm as was then the portion they beheld.  Storms, if less
frequent, are certainly not less violent than in other portions of the
world.  We certainly very frequently experienced the fickleness of the
elements.  I found many books on the microscope and the zoophytes,
as well as several scientific story-books. One of these I opened at the
following lines: "The cuttle-fish _Sepia Officinalis_ is a
cephalopodic mollusc whose body includes a spongy organ containing a
chylaqueous fluid saturated with carbonate of lime." My pretty little
neighbour finds this story very interesting. I beg of her, unless she
wishes me to die of mortification, never to read the story of
Honey-Bee.

II
In which we learn what the white rose meant to the Countess of Blanchelande

Having placed on her golden hair a little black hood embroidered with
pearls and bound about her waist a widow's girdle, the Countess
of Blanchelande entered the chapel where it was her daily custom to pray
for the soul of her husband who had been killed in single-handed
combat with a giant from Ireland.

That day she saw a white rose lying on the cushion of her _prie-Dieu_;
at sight of this she turned pale; her eyes grew dim; she bowed her head
and wrung her hand. For she knew that when a Countess of Blanchelande
is about to die she always finds a white rose on her _prie-Dieu_.

Warned by this that her time had come to leave a world in which in so
short a time she had been wife, mother and widow, she entered the
chamber where her son George slept in the care of the nurses.

He was three years old. His long eyelashes threw a lovely shadow
on his cheeks, and his mouth looked like a flower. At sight of him, so
helpless and so beautiful, she began to weep.

"My little child," she cried in anguish, "my dear little child, you
will never have known me and my image will fade for ever from your dear
eyes.
And yet, to be truly your mother, I nourished you with my own milk, and
for love of you I refused the hand of the noblest cavaliers."
So speaking she kissed a medallion in which was her own portrait and
a lock of her hair, and this she hung about the neck of her son. A
mothers tear fell on the little one's cheek as he stirred in
his cradle and rubbed his eyes with his little hands. But the Countess
turned her head away and fled out of the room.

How could eyes about to be extinguished for ever bear the light
of two dear eyes in which the soul was only beginning to dawn?

She ordered a steed to be saddled and followed by her squire,
Francoeur, she rode to the castle of Clarides.

The Duchess of Clarides embraced the Countess of Blanchelande.

"Loveliest! what good fortune brings you here?"
"The fortune that brings me here is not good. Listen, my friend. We
were married within a few years of each other, and similar fates have
made us widows.

For in these times of chivalry the best perish first, and in order to
live long one must be a monk. When you became a mother I had already
been one for two years. Your daughter Honey-Bee is lovely as the day, and
my little George is good. I love you and you love me. Know then that
I have found a white rose on the cushion of my _prie-Dieu_. I am about
to die; I leave you my son."
The Duchess knew what the white rose meant to the ladies of
Blanchelande. She began to weep and in the midst of her tears she
promised to bring up Honey-Bee and George as brother and sister, and to
give nothing to one which the other did not share.

Still in each other's arms the two women approached the cradle where
little Honey-Bee slept under light curtains, blue as the sky, and without
opening her eyes, she moved her little arms. And as she spread her
fingers five little rosy rays came out of each sleeve.

"He will defend her," said the mother of George.

"And she will love him," the mother of Honey-Bee replied.

"She will love him," a clear little voice repeated, which the Duchess
recognised as that of a spirit which for a long time had lived under the
hearth-stone.

On her return to her manor the lady of Blanchelande divided her
jewels among her women and having had herself anointed with perfumed
ointments and robed in her richest raiment in order to honour the body
destined to rise again at the Day of Judgment, she lay down on her bed
and fell asleep never again to awaken.

III

Wherein begins the love of George of Blanchelande and Honey- Bee of
Claride
Contrary to the common destiny which is to have more goodness than beauty,
or more beauty than goodness, the Duchess of Clarides was as good as she
was beautiful, and she was so beautiful that many princes, though they
had only seen her portrait, demanded her hand in marriage.
But to all their pleading she replied:

"I shall have but one husband as I have but one soul."
However, after five years of mourning she left off her long veil and
her black robes so as not to spoil the happiness of those about her, and
in order that all should smile and be free to enjoy themselves in her
presence. Her duchy comprised a great extent of country; moorlands,
overgrown by heather, covered the desolate expanse, lakes in which
fishermen sometimes caught magic fish, and mountains which rose in fearful
solitudes over subterraneous regions inhabited by dwarfs.

She governed Clarides with the help of an old monk who, having escaped
from Constantinople and seen much violence and treachery, had but little
faith in human goodness. He lived in a tower in the company of birds and
books, and from this place he filled his position as counsellor by the
aid of a number of little maxims. His rules were these: "Never revive
a law once fallen into disuse; always accede to the demands of a people
for fear of revolt, but accede as slowly as possible, because no sooner
is one reform granted than the public demands another, and you can be
turned out for acceding too quickly as well as for resisting too long."

The Duchess let him have his own way, for she understood nothing about
politics. She was compassionate and, as she was unable to respect all
men, she pitied those who were unfortunate enough to be wicked. She
helped the suffering in every possible way, visited the sick, comforted
the widows, and took the poor orphans under her protection.

She educated her daughter Honey-Bee with a charming wisdom. Having
brought the child up only to do good, she never denied her any pleasure.

This good woman kept the promise she had made to the poor Countess of
Blanchelande. She was like a mother to George, and she made no difference
between him and Honey-Bee. They grew up together, and George
approved of Honey-Bee, though he thought her rather small. Once,
when they were very little, he went up to her and asked:

"Will you play with me?"
"I should like to," said Honey-Bee.

"We will make mud pies," said George, which they proceeded to do. But
as Honey-Bee made hers very badly, George struck her fingers with his
spade. Whereupon Honey-Bee set up a most awful roar and the squire,
Francoeur, who was strolling about in the garden, said to his young
master:

"It is not worthy of a Count of Blanchelande to strike young ladies, your
lordship."
Whereupon George was seized with an ardent desire to hit Francoeur
also with his spade. But as this presented insurmountable difficulties,
he resigned himself to do what was easier, and that was to stand
with his nose against the trunk of a big tree and weep torrents.

In the meantime Honey-Bee took care to encourage her own tears by digging
her fists into her eyes; and in her despair she rubbed her nose
against the trunk of a neighbouring tree. When night came and softly
covered the earth, Honey-Bee and George were still weeping, each in
front of a tree. The Duchess of Clarides was obliged to come and take
her daughter by one hand and George by the other, and lead them back
to the castle. Their eyes were red and their noses were red and
their cheeks shone. They sighed and sobbed enough to break one's heart.
But they ate a good supper, after which they were both put to bed. But
as soon as the candle was blown out they re-appeared like two
little ghosts in two little night-gowns, and they hugged each other
and laughed at the top of their voices.

And thus began the love of Honey-Bee of Clarides and George of Blanchelande.

IV
Which treats of Education in general, and George of Blanche lande's in
particular
So George grew up in the Castle side by side with Honey-Bee, whom he
affectionately called his sister though he knew she was not.

He had masters in fencing, riding, swimming, gymnastics, dancing, hunting,
falconry, tennis, and, indeed, in all the arts. He even had a
writing-master. This was an old cleric, humble of manner but very proud
within, who taught him all manner of penmanship, and the more beautiful
this was the less decipherable it became. Very little pleasure or profit
did George get out of the old cleric's lessons, as little as out of
those of an old monk who taught him grammar in barbarous terms. George
could not understand the sense of learning a language which one
knows as a matter of course and which is called one's mother tongue.

He only enjoyed himself with Francoeur the squire, who, having
knocked about the world, understood the ways of men and beasts,
could describe all sorts of countries and compose songs which he
could not write.

Francoeur was the only one of his masters who taught George anything, for
he was the only one who really loved him, and the only good lessons
are those which are given with love.

The two old goggle-eyes, the writing-master and the grammar-master, who
hated each other with all their hearts, were, however, united in
a common hatred of the old squire, whom they accused of being a
drunkard.

It is true that Francoeur frequented the tavern "The Pewter Pot" somewhat
too zealously. It was here that he forgot his sorrows and composed his
songs. But of course it was very wrong of him.

Homer made better verses than Francoeur, and Homer only drank the
water of the springs. As for sorrows the whole world has sorrows, and
the thing to make one forget them is not the wine one drinks, but the
good one does.

But Francoeur was an old man grown grey in harness, faithful and
trustworthy, and the two masters of writing and grammar should
have hidden his failings from the duchess instead of giving her an
exaggerated account of them.

"Francoeur is a drunkard," said the writing-master, "and when he comes
back from 'The Pewter Pot' he makes a letter S as he walks. Moreover,
it is the only letter he has ever made; because if it please your
Grace, this drunkard is an ass."

The grammar-master added, "And the songs Francoeur sings as he staggers
about err against all rules and are constructed on no model at all. He
ignores all the rules of rhetoric, please your Grace."
The Duchess had a natural distaste for pedants and tale-bearers.

She did what we all would have done in her place; at first she did not
listen to them but as they again began to repeat their tittle-tattle,
she ended by believing them and decided to send Francoeur away. However,
to give him an honourable exile, she sent him to Rome to obtain the
blessing of the Pope. This journey was all the longer for Francoeur the
squire because a great many taverns much frequented by musicians separated
the duchy of Clarides from the holy apostolic seat. In the course of
this story we shall see how soon the Duchess regretted having deprived
the two children of their most faithful guardian.

V
Which tells how the Duchess took Honeybee and George to the Hermitage,
and of their encounter with a hideous old woman

That morning, it was the first Sunday after Easter, the Duchess rode
out of the castle on her great sorrel horse, while on? her left George
of Blanchelande was mounted on a dark horse with a white star on
his black forehead, and on her right Honey-Bee guided her milk-white
steed with rose-coloured reins.

They were on their way to the Hermitage to hear mass. Soldiers armed with
lances formed their escort and, as they passed, the people crowded forward
to admire them, and, indeed, all three were very fair to see.

Under a veil of silver flowers and with flowing mantle the Duchess had an
air of lovely majesty; while the pearls with which her coif was
embroidered shone with a soft radiance that well-suited the face and
soul of this beautiful lady. George by her side with flowing hair and
sparkling eyes was very good to see. And on the other side rode
Honey-Bee, the tender and pure colour of her face like a caress for
the eyes; but most glorious of all her fair tresses, flowing over her
shoulders, held by a circlet of gold surmounted by three gold flowers,
seemed the shining mantle of her youth and beauty.
The good people said, on seeing her:

"What a lovely young damsel."
The master tailor, old Jean, took his grandson Peter in his arms
to point out |Honey-Bce to him, and Peter asked was she alive or
was she an image of wax, for he could not understand how any one
could be so white and so lovely, and yet belong to the same race
as himself, little Peter with his good big weather-beaten cheeks,
and his little home-spun shirt laced behind in country fashion.

While the Duchess accepted the people's homage with gracious kindness,
the two children showed how it gratified their pride, George by his
blushes, Honey-Bee by her smiles, and for this reason the Duchess
said to them:

"How kindly these good people greet us.

For what reason, George? And what is the reason, Honey-Bee?"
"So they should," said Honey-Bee.

"It's their duty," George added.

"But why should it be their duty?" asked the Duchess.

And as neither replied, she continued:

"I will tell you. For more than three hundred years the dukes of Clarides,
from father to son, have lance in hand protected these poor people so
that they could gather the harvests of the fields they had sown. For
more than three hundred years all the duchesses of Clarides have
spun the cloth for the poor, have visited the sick, and have held the
new-born at the baptismal font. That is the reason they greet you, my
children."
George was lost in deep thought: "We must protect those who toil on
the land," and Honcy-Bee said: "One should spin for the poor."
And thus chatting and meditating they went on their way through meadows
starred with flowers. A fringe of blue mountains lay against the distant
horizon. George pointed towards the east.

"Is that a great steel shield I see over there?"

"Oh no," said Honey-Bee, "it's a round silver clasp, as big as the
moon."
"It is neither a steel shield nor a silver clasp, my children," replied
the Duchess, "but a lake glittering in the sunshine. The surface of this
lake, which seen from here is as smooth as a mirror, is stirred
by innumerable ripples.

Its borders which appear as distinct as it cut in metal are really
covered by reeds with feathery plumes and irises whose flower is
like a human glance between the blades of swords.

Every morning a white mist rises over the lake which shines like armour
under the midday sun. But none must approach it for in it dwell the
nixies who lure passers by into their crystal abodes."
At this moment the bell of the Hermitage was heard.

"Let us dismount," said the Duchess, "and walk to the chapel.

It was neither on elephants nor camels that the wise men of the East
approached the manger."
They heard the hermit's mass. A hideous old crone covered with rags
knelt beside the Duchesss, who on leaving the church offered her holy
water.

"Accept it, good mother," she said.

George was amazed.

"Do you not know," said the Duchess, "that in the poor you honour
the chosen of our Lord Jesus Christ?

A beggar such as this as well as the good Duke of Rochesnoires held you
at the font when you were baptized; and your little sister, Honey-Bee,
also had one of these poor creatures as godmother."
The old crone who seemed to have guessed the boy's thoughts leaned
towards him.

"Fair prince," she cried mockingly, "may you conquer as many kingdoms
as I have lost. I was the queen of the Island of Pearls and the Mountains
of Gold; each day my table was served with fourteen different kinds of
fish, and a negro page bore my train."
"And by what misfortune have you lost your islands and your mountains,
good woman?" asked the Duchess.

"I vexed the dwarfs, and they carried me far away from my dominions."
"Are the dwarfs so powerful?" George asked.

"As they live in the earth," the old woman answered, "they know the
virtue of precious stones, they work in metals, and they unseal the
hidden sources of the springs."
"And what did you do to vex them?" asked the Duchess.

"On a December night," said the old woman, "one of them came to ask
permission to prepare a great midnight banquet in the kitchen of the
castle, which, vaster than a chapter-house, was furnished with
casseroles, frying-pans, earthen saucepans, kettles, pans, portable-ovens,
gridirons, boilers, dripping-pans, dutch-ovens, fish-kettles,
copper-pans, pastry-moulds, copper-jugs, goblets of gold and silver,
and mottled wood, not to mention iron roasting-jacks, artistically
forged, and the huge black cauldron which hung from the pothook. He
promised neither to disturb nor to damage anything. I refused his
request, and he disappeared muttering vague threats. The third night,
it being Christmas, this same dwarf returned to the chamber where I
slept. He was accompanied by innumerable others, who pulled me out
of bed and carried me to an unknown land in my nightgown. 'Such,' they
said as they left me, 'such is the punishment of the rich who refuse
even a part of their treasure to the industrious and kindly dwarf folk
who work in gold and cause the springs to flow.'"
Thus said the toothless old woman, and the Duchess having comforted her
with words and money, she and the two children retraced their way to the
castle.

VI
Which tells of what can be seen from the Keep of Clarides
It was one day shortly after this that Honey-Bee and George, without
being observed, climbed the steps of the watch-tower which stands
in the middle of the Castle of Clarides. Having reached the platform
they shouted at the top of their voices and clapped their hands.
Their view extended down the hillside divided into brown and green
squares of cultivated fields. Woods and mountains lay dimly blue
against the distant horizon.
"Little sister," cried George, "little sister, look at the whole
wide world!"
"The world is very big," said Honey-Bee. "My teachers," said George,
"have taught me that it is very big; but, as Gertrude our housekeeper
says, one must see to believe."
They went the round of the platform.
"Here is something wonderful, little brother," cried Honey-Bee.
"The castle stands in the middle of the earth and we are on the
watch-tower in the middle of the castle, and so we are standing in
the middle of the earth. Ha! ha! ha!"
And, indeed, the horizon formed a circle about the children of which
the watch-tower was the centre.
"We are in the middle of the earth! Ha! ha! ha!" George
repeated.

Whereupon they both started a-thinking.
"What a pity that the world is so big!" said Honey-Bee, "one might
get lost and be separated from one's friends."
George shrugged his shoulders.
"How lucky that the world is so big! One can go in search of
adventures.
When I am grown up I mean to conquer the mountains that stand at
the ends of the earth. That is where the moon rises; I shall seize
her as she passes, and I will give her to you, Honey-Bee."
"Yes," said Honey-Bee, "give her to me and I will put her in my
hair."
Then they busied themselves searching for the places they knew as
on a map.
"I recognise everything," said Honey-Bee, who recognised nothing,
"but what are those little square stones scattered over the hillside?"

"Houses," George replied. "Those are houses. Don't you recognise
the capital of the Duchy of Clarides, little sister? After all, it
is a great city; it has three streets, and one can drive through
one of them.
Don't you remember that we passed through it last week when we went
to the Hermitage?" 
"And what is that winding brook?"
"That is the river. See the old stone bridge down there?"
"The bridge under which we fished for crayfish?"
"That's the one; and in one of the niches stands the statue of the
'Woman without a Head.' One cannot see her from here because she
is too small."
"I remember. But why hasn't she got a head?"
"Probably because she has lost it."
Without saying if this explanation was satisfactory, Honey-Bee gazed
at the horizon.
"Little brother, little brother, just see what sparkles by the side
of the blue mountains? It is the lake." 
"It is the lake."
They then remembered what the Duchess had told them of these beautiful
and dangerous waters where the nixies dwell.
"We will go there," said Honey-Bee.
George was aghast. He stared at her with his mouth wide open.
"But the Duchess has forbidden us to go out alone, so how can we
go to this lake which is at the end of the earth?"
"How can we go? I don't know. It's you who ought to know, for you
are a man and you have a grammar-master."We lunched with the
governor; and then, while the captain returned on board, Jerry and I and
the doctor started with a guide to take a long walk into the country.
Away we went, highly delighted, and soon found ourselves in a beautiful
and fertile valley, with waterfalls coming down the sides of the hills,
and bright streams and ponds.  We came, too, upon a flock of goats; and
one very old fellow had a nick in his ear, so we had no doubt that he
was one of those left by Robinson Crusoe himself.  The doctor would not
give, an opinion on the subject, but Jerry asserted that there could not
be a shadow of doubt about it.  Going on a little further, we came upon
a cave--a veritable cave--in the side of the mountain, with a sort of
rough porch in front of it, built of boughs and thatched with straw.
Jerry uttered a loud shout of delight.

"There!" he exclaimed.  "I knew it was all true.  Why, there is the very
hut Robinson Crusoe built for himself."

His voice must have aroused some one who was within, for a door was
pushed open, and a figure appeared, who, if he was not Robinson Crusoe,
was very like pictures of him.  He had a long beard, and was dressed in
goat-skins, and had sandals on his feet, and a thick stick in his hand--
altogether a very wild-looking character.  Jerry drew back, and looked
at him very much as if by some incantation he had conjured up the spirit
of the long-departed hero.

"It can't be Crusoe!" he gasped out.  "Yet, if it isn't, who can he be?"
At length he gained courage, and both of us slowly approaching the man,
he said, with a desperate effort, "Pray, tell me who you are?"

A grim smile lighted up such of the features of the man as could be seen
through his bushy beard, whiskers, and moustaches.  He shook his head.
Jerry repeated the question.

"No intende," he answered.

"Then he can't be Robinson Crusoe if he doesn't understand English,"
whispered Jerry, with a sigh.

The doctor, who had been behind gathering plants, now came up.  He
laughed heartily when we told him that we had had great hopes that the
rough-looking stranger might turn out to be Robinson Crusoe himself,
gone back to live on his own island.  He exchanged a few words with the
stranger.

"The man tells me that he is a goat-herd--a convict--unjustly banished
here;--that of course.  He begs that we will give him a few coppers to
buy a glass of rum."

Jerry and I eagerly searched in our pockets, when we discovered some
Chilian coins, which we bestowed on the poor goat-herd; but even as I
dropped them into his hand, I could not help feeling that I was offering
an insult to a great man in distress by giving him such a trifle.  The
provoking part of the affair was, that, as the doctor told us, the man
himself had never even heard of Robinson Crusoe in the whole course of
his life.  I loved and admired him to a degree of enthusiasm, and of
course strove to imitate him. In some measure I succeeded; I had
pride before, but he taught it to flow in proper channels. His
knowledge of the world was vastly superior to mine, and I was all attention
to learn. . . . My reading only increased while in this town by two
stray volumes of "Pamela," and one of "Ferdinand Count Fathom," which
gave me some idea of novels.

Rhyme, except some religious pieces that are in print, I had given up;
but meeting with Fergusson's Scottish Poems, I strung anew my wildly
sounding lyre with emulating vigour. When my father died his all went
among the hell-hounds that growl in the kennel of justice; but we made
a shift to collect a little money in the family amongst us, with
which to keep us together; my brother and I took a neighbouring farm.
My brother wanted my hare-brained imagination, as well as my social
and amorous madness; but in good sense, and every sober qualification,
he was far my superior.

I entered on this farm with a full resolution, "come, go to, I will be
wise!" I read farming books, I calculated crops; I attended markets;
and, in short, in spite of the devil, and the world, and the flesh, I
believe I should have been a wise man; but the first year, from
unfortunately buying bad seed, the second from a late harvest, we lost
half our crops. This overset all my wisdom, and I returned, "like the
dog to his vomit, and the sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the
mire."
I now began to be known in the neighbourhood as a maker of rhymes. The
first of my poetic offspring that saw the light was a burlesque
lamentation on a quarrel between two reverend Calvinists, both of
them figuring in my "Holy Fair."

I had a notion myself that the piece had some merit; but, to prevent the
worst, I gave a copy of it to a friend, who was very fond of such things,
and told him that I could not guess who was the author of it,
but that I thought it pretty clever.

With a certain description of the clergy, as well as laity, it met
with a roar of applause.

"Holy Willie's Prayer" next made its appearance, and alarmed the
kirk-session so much, that they held several meetings to look over
their spiritual artillery, if haply any of it might be pointed
against profane rhymers.

Unluckily for me, my wanderings led me on another side, within point-blank
shot of their heaviest metal.

This is the unfortunate story that gave rise to my printed poem, "The
Lament." This was a most melancholy affair, which I cannot yet bear
to reflect on, and had very nearly given me one or two of the principal
qualifications for a place among those who have lost the chart, and
mistaken the reckoning of rationality. I gave up my part of the farm
to my brother; in truth, it was only nominally mine; and made what
little preparation was in my power for Jamaica.

But before leaving my native country forever, I resolved to publish
my poems. I weighed my productions as impartially as was in my power;
I thought they had merit; and it was a delicious idea that I should
be called a clever fellow, even though it should never reach my
ears--a poor Negro driver--or perhaps a victim to that inhospitable
clime, and gone to the world of spirits!

I can truly say that, poor and unknown as I then was, I had pretty
nearly as high an idea of myself and of my works as I have at this
moment, when the public has decided in their favour.

It ever was my opinion that the mistakes and blunders, both in a
rational and religious point of view, of which we see thousands
daily guilty, are owing to their ignorance of themselves. To know myself
had been all along my constant study. I weighed myself alone; I balanced
myself with others. I watched every means of information, to see how
much ground I occupied as a man and as a poet; I studied assiduously
Nature's design in my formation--where the lights and shades in my
character were intended.

I was pretty confident my poems would meet with some applause; but at
the worst, the roar of the Atlantic would deafen the voice of censure,
and the novelty of West Indian scenes make me forget neglect. I threw
off six hundred copies, of which I had got subscriptions for about three
hundred and fifty. My vanity was highly gratified by the reception I met
with from the public; and besides I pocketed, all expenses deducted,
nearly twenty pounds. This sum came very seasonably, as I was thinking
of indenting myself for want of money to procure my passage. As soon as
I was master of nine guineas, the price of wafting me to the torrid
zone, I took a steerage passage in the first ship that was to sail from
the Clyde, for
Hungry ruin had me in the wind.

I had been for some days skulking from covert to covert, under all the
terrors of a jail; as some ill-advised people had uncoupled the merciless
pack of the law at my heels. I had taken the last farewell of my few
friends; my chest was on the road to Greenock; I had composed the last
song I should ever measure in Caledonia--"The Gloomy Night Is Gathering
Fast," when a letter from Dr. Blacklock to a friend of mine overthrew
all my schemes by opening new prospects to my poetic ambition.
The doctor belonged to a set of critics for whose applause I had not
dared to hope. His opinion, that I would meet with encouragement in
Edinburgh for a second edition, fired me so much, that away I posted
for that city, without a single acquaintance, or a single letter of
introduction. The baneful star that had so long shed its blasting influence
in my zenith for once made a revolution to the nadir; and a kind
Providence placed me under the patronage of one of the noblest of men,
the Earl of Glencairn.

_Oublie moi, grand Dieu, si jamais je l'oublie_ [Forget me, Great
God, if I ever forget him!].

I need relate no further.

At Edinburgh I was in a new world; I mingled among many classes
of men, but all of them new to me, and I was all attention to "catch"
the characters and "the manners living as they rise." Whether I have
profited, time will show.

POETS ARE BORN--THEN MADE
[_To Dr. Moore_]
ELLISLAND, 4th January, 1789.

. . . The character and employment of a poet were formerly my pleasure,
but are now my pride. I know that a very great deal of my late _éclat_
was owing to the singularity of my situation and the honest prejudice
of Scotsmen; but still, as I said in the preface to my first edition,
I do look upon myself as having some pretensions from nature to the
poetic character. I have not a doubt but the knack, the aptitude, to learn
the muses' trade, is a gift bestowed by Him "who forms the secret bias
of the soul"; but I as firmly believe that _excellence_ in the profession
is the fruit of industry, labour, attention, and pains. At least I
am resolved to try my doctrine by the test of experience.
Another appearance from the press I put off to a very distant day, a day
that may never arrive--but poesy I am determined to prosecute
with all my vigour. Nature has given very few, if any, of the profession,
the talents of shining in every species of composition. I shall try (for
until trial it is impossible to know) whether she has qualified me to
shine in any one.

THE KINDLY CRITIC IS THE POET'S BEST FRIEND 
[_To Mr.

Moore_]
The worst of it is, by the time one has finished a piece, it has been
so often viewed and reviewed before the mental eye that one loses, in
a good measure, the power of critical discrimination. Here the best
criterion I know is a friend--not only of abilities to judge, but with
good nature enough like a prudent teacher with a young learner
to praise a little more than is exactly just, lest the thin-skinned
animal fall into that most deplorable of all diseases--heart-breaking
despondency of himself. Dare I, sir, already immensely indebted to your
goodness, ask the additional obligation of your being that friend to
me? . . .

HORACE GREELEY
(1811-1872)
HOW THE FARM-BOY BECAME AN EDITOR
Horace Greeley, the farmer's son, lived most of his life in the
metropolis, yet he always looked like a farmer, and most people would
be willing to admit that he retained the farmer's traditional goodness
of heart, if not quite all of his traditional simplicity. His judgment
was keen and shrewd, and for many years the cracker-box philosophers
of the village store impatiently awaited the sorting of the mail chiefly
that they might learn what "Old Horace" had to say about some new picture
in the kaleidoscope of politics.

From "Captains of Industry," by James Parton. Houghton, Mifflin & Co.,
1884.

I have seldom been more interested than in hearing Horace Greeley tell
the story of his coming to New York, in 1831, and gradually working
his way into business there.

He was living at the age of twenty years with his parents in a small
log-cabin in a new clearing of Western Pennsylvania, about twenty miles
from Erie.

His father, a Yankee by birth, had recently moved to that region and was
trying to raise sheep there, as he had been accustomed to do in
Vermont. The wolves were too numerous there.

It was part of the business of Horace and his brother to watch the
flock of sheep, and sometimes they camped out all night, sleeping
with their feet to the fire, Indian fashion.

He told me that occasionally a pack of wolves would come so near that
he could see their eyeballs glare in the darkness and hear them pant.
Even as he lay in the loft of his father's cabin he could hear them howling
in the fields. In spite of all their care, the wolves killed in one
season a hundred of his father's sheep, and then he gave up the
attempt.

The family were so poor that it was a matter of doubt sometimes whether
they could get food enough to live through the long winter, and so
Horace, who had learned the printer's trade in Vermont, started out on
foot in search of work in a village printing office. He walked from
village to village, and from town to town, until at last he went
to Erie, the largest place in the vicinity.

There he was taken for a runaway apprentice, and certainly his appearance
justified suspicion. Tall and gawky as he was in person, with
tow-coloured hair, and a scanty suit of shabbiest homespun, his
appearance excited astonishment or ridicule wherever he went. He had
never worn a good suit of clothes in his life. He had a singularly fair,
white complexion, a piping, whining voice, and these peculiarities
gave the effect of his being wanting in intellect. It was not until
people conversed with him that they discovered his worth and intelligence.
He had been an ardent reader from his childhood up, and had taken of
late years the most intense interest in politics and held very positive
opinions, which he defended in conversation with great earnestness and
ability.

A second application at Erie procured him employment for a few months
in the office of the Erie _Gazette_, and he won his way, not
only to the respect, but to the affection of his companions and his
employer.
That employer was Judge J. M. Sterrett, and from him I heard many curious
particulars of Horace Greeley's residence in Erie.

As he was only working in the office as a substitute, the return of
the absentee deprived him of his place, and he was obliged to seek work
elsewhere.
His employer said to him one day:

"Now, Horace, you have a good deal of money coming to you; don't go
about the town any longer in that outlandish rig. Let me give you an
order on the store. Dress up a little, Horace."
The young man looked down on his clothes as though he had never seen
them before, and then said, by way of apology:

"You see, Mr. Sterrett, my father is on a new place, and I want to help
him all I can."
In fact, upon the settlement of his account at the end of his seven
months' labour, he had drawn for his personal expenses six dollars
only. Of the rest of his wages he retained fifteen dollars for himself,
and gave all the rest, amounting to about a hundred and twenty dollars,
to his father, who, I am afraid, did not make the very best use of all
of it.

With the great sum of fifteen dollars in his pocket, Horace now resolved
upon a bold movement. After spending a few days at home, he tied up his
spare clothes in a bundle, not very large, and took the shortest road
through the woods that led to the Erie Canal. He was going to New York,
and he was going cheap!

A walk of sixty miles or so, much of it through the primeval forest,
brought him to Buffalo, where he took passage on the Erie Canal, and after
various detentions he reached Albany on a Thursday morning just in time
to see the regular steamboat of the day move out into the stream. At ten
o'clock on the same morning he embarked on board of a towboat,
which required nearly twenty-four hours to descend the river,
and thus afforded him ample time to enjoy the beauty of its shores.

On the 18th of August, 1831, about sunrise, he set foot in the city of
New York, then containing about two hundred thousand inhabitants. . .
.
He had managed his affairs with such strict economy that his journey of
six hundred miles had cost him little more than five dollars, and
he had ten left with which to begin life in the metropolis. This
sum of money and the knowledge of the printer's trade made up his
capital.

There was not a person in all New York, as far as he knew, who had ever
seen him before.

His appearance, too, was much against him, for although he had a really
fine face, a noble forehead, and the most benign expression I ever saw
upon a human countenance, yet his clothes and bearing quite
spoiled him. His round jacket made him look like a tall boy who had
grown too fast for his strength; he stooped a little and walked in a
loose-jointed manner. He was very bashful, and totally destitute of the
power of pushing his way, or arguing with a man who said, "No" to him.
He had brought no letters of recommendation, and had no kind of evidence
to show that he had even learned his trade.

The first business was, of course, to find an extremely cheap boarding-house,
as he had made up his mind only to try New York as an experiment,
and, if he did not succeed in finding work, to start homeward while
he still had a portion of his money.

After walking a while he went into what looked to him like a low-priced
tavern, at the corner of Wall and Broad streets.

"How much do you charge for board?" he asked the barkeeper, who was
wiping his decanters, and putting his bar in trim for the business
of the day.

The barkeeper gave the stranger a look-over and said to him:

"I guess we're too high for you."

"Well, how much do you charge?"
"Six dollars."
"Yes, that's more than I can afford."
He walked on until he descried on the North River, near Washington
Market, a boarding-house so very mean and squalid that he was tempted
to go in and inquire the price of board there. The price was two
dollars and a half a week.
"Ah!" said Horace, "that sounds more like it."
In ten minutes more he was taking his breakfast at the landlord's
table. Mr. Greeley gratefully remembered this landlord, who was a
friendly Irishman by the name of McGorlick. Breakfast done, the
newcomer sallied forth in quest of work, and began by expending
nearly half of his capital in improving his wardrobe. It was a wise
action.
He that goes courting should dress in his best, particularly if he
courts so capricious a jade as Fortune.
Then he began the weary round of the printing offices, seeking for
work and finding none, all day long. He would enter an office and
ask in his whining note:

"Do you want a hand?"
"No," was the inevitable reply, upon receiving which he left without
a word. Mr. Greeley chuckled as he told the reception given him at
the office of the _Journal of Commerce_, a newspaper he was destined
to contend with for many a year in the columns of the _Tribune_.
"Do you want a hand?" he said to David Hale, one of the owners of
the paper.
Mr. Hale looked at him from head to foot, and then said:
"My opinion is, young man, that you're a runaway apprentice, and
you'd better go home to your master."
The applicant tried to explain, but the busy proprietor merely
replied:

"Be off about your business, and don't bother us."
The young man laughed good-humouredly and resumed his walk. He went
to bed Saturday night thoroughly tired and a little discouraged.
On Sunday he walked three miles to attend a church, and remembered
to the end of his days the delight he had, for the first time in
his life, in hearing a sermon that he entirely agreed with. In the
meantime he had gained the good will of his landlord and the boarders,
and to that circumstance he owed his first chance in the city. His
landlord mentioned his fruitless search for work to an acquaintance
who happened to call that Sunday afternoon. That acquaintance, who
was a shoemaker, had accidently heard that printers were wanted at
No. 85 Chatham Street.
At half-past five on Monday morning Horace Greeley stood before the
designated house, and discovered the sign, "West's Printing Office,"
over the second story, the ground floor being occupied as a
bookstore.
Not a soul was stirring up stairs or down. The doors were locked,
and Horace sat down on the steps to wait. Thousands of workmen
passed by; but it was nearly seven before the first of Mr. West's
printers arrived, and he, too, finding the door locked, sat down
by the side of the stranger, and entered into conversation with him."We shall see, doctor," said I.  "I hope you are right."  Just then we
reached a small hut, such as is inhabited by Indians.  Jerry declared
that he must have a draught of milk, as we saw some cows feeding near,
and before the guide could stop him, he had knocked at the door.
Instead of the kindly face of an Indian appearing at his summons, out
rushed a big, savage-looking negro, and by his angry gestures seemed to
inquire what we wanted.

"A calabash of milk, friend Sambo," answered Jerry, in no ways daunted.
While, however, he was speaking, two other blacks appeared at the door,
while three or four more, flourishing long knives, came running toward
us from a neighbouring wood.

"Put spurs to your horses, boys, and let us get away from this!" cried
the doctor.  As we were attempting to follow his advice, one of the
blacks seized Jerry's rein, and though I struck the fellow a heavy blow
with my stick, he would not let go his hold.  The consequence of the
blow was nearly fatal to me, for the fellow with his other hand struck
at me with a long glittering knife, and had not I pulled back my horse
by an involuntary movement, he would have plunged it into my side--as it
was, he cut my trousers and drew blood from my leg.  Seeing things come
to this pass, the doctor and Silva, who proved himself a brave fellow,
began to lay about them, one with his stick and the other with a heavy
Spanish riding whip; while old Surley, who, after growling fiercely, saw
that the time for action had now arrived, began to bite away at the
negroes' thin calves and long heels, greatly to their annoyance.  Each
man, as he found himself bit, turned round and endeavoured to stab the
dog, and very much afraid I was that they would succeed; but so actively
did he jump about from side to side, now bounding here, now there, that
not one of the numberless blows which were struck reached him, while his
furious barking and repeated bites served most materially to distract
the attention of our assailants.  Still they were fully eight armed
savages to five people with sticks and a whip, and a dog; and as Jerry
and I were only boys, and old Surley had only his teeth to fight with,
it must be acknowledged that we were very unequally matched.  Feeling
this, we should certainly have felt it no disgrace to run away if we
could; but the black held on so tightly to Jerry's rein that we could
not escape.  At last the negro I speak of, finding that he had missed me
and could not hit the dog, lifted up his long knife and made a desperate
lounge with it at Jerry.  I saw what he was about to do, and crying out
to Surley, my stick instinctively came down with all its force on the
ruffian's arm, while the dog sprung up and caught him by the throat.  He
let go at that moment the rein.

"Now on, boys, on!" sung out the doctor, who saw what had occurred; and
bringing our sticks down on our horses' backs, we dashed past the
infuriated negroes, on whose heads Silva bestowed many a terrific whack
with his stout stick, as they attempted to catch his rein.  We were
followed closely by the guide and our valiant ally, old Surley, at whom
several blows were aimed, but he escaped them all, and at full gallop we
pushed over the sandy plain, pursued by our black assailants.  Happily
they had no fire-arms, or we should have fared ill.  When we had got
beyond their reach we pulled up and congratulated ourselves on our
escape, while old Surley came in for his due share of praise and thanks.
He wagged his tail and opened his mouth, as if he were about to speak
and say, "I only did my duty, masters; you feed me well, and treat me
kindly, and I love you, and am ready to fight for you, and do you any
other service in my power, as I hope to prove whenever I have the
opportunity."

It was very late when we got back to Lima, to the house of a merchant
who had asked us to stay with him.  He told us that the blacks who
attacked us were, he had no doubt, emancipated slaves, who had always
borne a very bad character.  Had they been properly educated, and
prepared for freedom, they might have turned out well; but those
wretches are a melancholy example of what will be found to be the case
in other countries where slavery still exists, should the slaves
suddenly be made free, or should they rise and win their freedom for
themselves.  It is about ten one, chiefly through cultivated ground;

scenery of the Amazon.  We saw enough of the country to make us long to
see more of it, but were obliged to hurry back to the railway-station to
get to Callao, once more to embark on board the _Triton_.

It was night by the time we reached the harbour, the sea calm as glass;
and it struck me that there was something peculiarly solemn as we looked
out on that dark, silent expanse of water, after gazing as we had done
for some days on the lofty snow-capped Cordilleras, and the laughing
green valleys round Lima.  Dark as was the water, no sooner were the
oars dipped in it than it appeared as if they were ladling up some
red-hot fluid metal; and as the boat which was sent to take us off
pulled toward us from the ship, she left a long line of fire in her
wake.  Even when we scooped up the water in our hands and threw it into
the air, it appeared like sparkles of fire, so long did it retain its
brilliancy.  I shall make it into a song." In the meantime the birds

majestic dwarf who stood there in serene dignity, gold sceptre in hand
and wearing the royal crown and the purple mantle. And in this dwarf he
recognised the little man who had delivered him out of his crystal
dungeon. Thereupon he threw himself at his feet and cried weeping:" O
my benefactor, who are you?

Are you one of those who have robbed me of Honey-Bee, whom I love?""

I am King Loc," replied the dwarf." I have kept Honey-Bee with me to

A great silence ensued and Honey-Bee appeared attired all in white and
with flowing golden hair.

No sooner did she see George than she ran Jerry and threw herself
in his arms and clasped his iron breast with all strength. Then King
Loc said to her:" Honey-Bee, is it true that this is the man you" See,

arrayed themselves in the splendid garments prepared for them by the

knees, her head in her hands. All the little men who witnessed this
scene deluged their cross-bows with tears. Only King Loc remained
serene. And Honcy-Bee, defeat by his magnanimity and his goodness, felt
for him the the kingdom of the dwarfs. By the light of this subterranean
luminary they discovered that they were standing at the foot of father.
She took her lover's hand." George, she said, love of a daughter for

when they were astonished to see a brilliant" It is called the cavern."

Take them, Honey-Bee, they will remind you of your little person.
It is their gift to you, not mine. What I am about to give you, you shall
know before long." A lengthy silence ensued. With an expression sublime
in its tenderness, King Loc gazed at Honey-Bee, whose beautiful
and radiant head, crowned by roses, rested on and very well named
too.

My deceased husband----"" Not another word, Maurille! But you. Francoeur,

Then he continued:" My children, it is not enough to love passionately;

And as it was the shoe of a little girl he decided that she who had

This,
after a time, was done, when the wind lulled, under a close-reefed
fore-topsail.  We rode after this much more pleasantly, and then the sea
began to go down, and once more we could move about the deck without
danger of being washed overboard.

"All hands make sail!" was at length the cheering cry, just as the sun
had set, as the poets say, in his ocean bed.  We sprang aloft--Jerry and
I racing who should be first up on the yard-arm.  Surley looked as if he
would like to follow.  Jerry beat me.  The ship was still rolling
heavily in the swell after the gale.  He was springing out towards the
yard-arm, laughing gaily at his success, when the ship gave a roll, and
away he was sent clear of the bulwarks and into the sea.  To glide down
by a back-stay and to jump overboard after him was the work of a moment.
I scarcely knew what I was doing.  I fancied that I just heard the cry
of "A man overboard;" but I was not certain.  I knew that I was for my
size a good swimmer, and I wanted to save my friend.  He could swim, but
not much.  He threw up his arms; I saw him, and struck out towards him.
I had a companion, I found, hastening also to his rescue.  It was old
Surley.  He swam faster than I did, seeming to know the importance of
haste.  We were not without means of support, for as Jerry fell the
life-buoy had been let go.  It was such as are carried by men-of-war,
and could support several people.  I sung out to Jerry.  He heard my
voice, but he only answered faintly.  He had got his mouth full of
water, and had been stunned and confused by his fall.  He was beating
the water wildly, forgetting apparently that he could swim.

"Help! help!" he sung out; "I'm sinking!  I'm sinking!"  I did my utmost
to reach him, but was still some way off.  Surley dashed towards him,
and seized him by the collar, holding his head above water.  I saw that
the best thing I could do was to tow the life-buoy up to him.  It was
not far off.  Surley seemed to divine my intention, and swam towards it.
At last I got it up to Jerry.  He had just strength enough left to
catch hold of it.  Old Surley put his paws in the beckets to support
himself, and then we all three were hanging on to the life-buoy, while
the ship, as it seemed to us, was running far away, already almost
concealed by the thick clouds of spray with which we were surrounded.


CHAPTER ELEVEN.

ADVENTURES IN MEXICO.

"I am so glad you are saved, Jerry," said I.  These were the first words
I spoke after we had got hold of the life-buoy.

"But are we saved?" he exclaimed.  "Will the ship be able to come back?
and if she does, will they see us, do you think?"

"They'll not desert us--of that we may be certain," I replied; and I
thought how heart-broken Captain Frankland would be when he found that
his son had fallen overboard and was in all probability lost.  Strange
to say, I did not think at all of my own perilous position.  I had gone
to save Jerry, and it seemed a matter of course that I must save him.
It must be remembered that our heads were very little above the level of
the water, and that although the sea had gone down considerably, we were
surrounded by masses of foam--now sinking into the trough, now rising to
the top of a wave.  Our view, therefore, was very limited.  We were
looking out eagerly for the ship through the thickening gloom.  Happily,
when the life-buoy was let go, the trigger was pulled.  This set off a
sort of blue light, which burned at the top, and which water could not
extinguish.  We felt sure, therefore, that as long as that light
continued burning we should be seen by those on board.  Our great dread
was that the light would go out before the ship could get back to us.
We strained our eyes in the direction of the ship.  The thickening gloom
and mist were rapidly encircling her, and shrouding her from our sight.

"O Harry, Harry, she's going away, and they won't know where to look for
us!" cried Jerry.  "Poor father, what will he do? and my carelessness
has brought you into this trouble, and poor Surley too.  I wish you
hadn't jumped overboard for me."

"I'm very glad I did, for I don't think that you would have been alive
now if I had not," I answered; "and don't have any regrets about me--I
only did my duty, and I am sure that you would have done the same for
me.  Why, she couldn't imagine.
In a moment she forgot it, for Wesley was looking at her hard.

"It's funny," he said, "to think I only saw you yesterday, and that we
got married this morning. Seems as if you'd been here for years and
years.

Does it seem awful strange to you, honey?"
"No," said Annie. "No, it doesn't. It is queer, but all the way here,
and when I come into the house, I had a sense of having been here before
sometime; kind of as if it was my home all along and I hadn't known
about it."

"So it was--and if I hadn't ever met you I'd been an old bach all
my life."
"Yes, you would."
"Yes, I wouldn't."

They were both laughing now. He got up and stretched himself.

"Well, Mrs. Dean," he said, "I gotta go out and fix my disker, and you
gotta come along. I don't want to let you out of my sight. You
might fly off somewhere, and I'd never find you again."
"Don't you worry about that. You couldn't lose me if you tried."
They went through the kitchen, and there a tall gaunt old coloured man
rose and bowed respectfully.

He and Aunt Dolcey were having their own dinner at the kitchen
table.

"This here's Unc' Zenas," said Wesley. "He's Aunt Dolcey's husband, and
helps me on the place."
And again Annie saw, this time in the old man's eyes, the flicker of
sympathy and apprehension that she had marked in Aunt Dolcey's.

"And right glad to welcome y', Missy," said Unc' Zenas. "We didn' 'spect
Marse Wes to bring home a wife whenas he lef', but that ain' no sign
that it ain' a mighty fine thing."

They went out into the mellow spring day. Wesley Dean, now in his blue
overalls and working shirt, became a king in his own domain, a part
of the fair primitiveness about them. It was as if he had sprung from
this dark fertile soil, was made of its elements, at one with it.
Here he belonged, and the very spring of the earth beneath his feet
was repeated in the measured beating of his blood.

The land could not warp or break him, as it does so many, for he belonged
to it as essentially and as completely as it belonged to him. Dimly the
little town girl beside him felt this, and dimly she hoped that
she, too, might prove to be of the same mould.

"Look at the barn, and the stables, and the corncrib," he was saying.
"See how they're all built? Hand-hewn logs chinked with plaster.
Great-granddad built them all, helped by his two slaves. That's all
the slaves he had, just two and one of 'em was Unc' Zenas's grandfather.
Everything's strong and sound as the day he finished it."
"That one looks newer," said Annie, pointing.

Wesley looked a little shamefaced, as does every typical Anglo-Saxon
discovered in sentiment.

"I built that," he confessed. "It's a chicken house. Somehow I didn't
want to go down to the sawmill and get planks and build with 'em 'mongst
all these old log things. So I got the logs out in the woods and build
same as great-granddad. Maybe it was foolish, but I couldn't help it."

"It wasn't foolish; it was nice," she affirmed.

She perched on the tongue of a wagon while he mended the disker, dividing
her attention between him and the live things of the barnyard. A
string of decorative white ducks marched in single file about the edge
of the cow pound. Beyond them a proud red-wattled cock paraded and
purred among his harem of trim hens, now and then disturbed in his dignity
by the darting nervousness of a pair of malicious guineas, acknowledged
brigands of the feathered tribes. Trim iridescent pigeons toddled about
on their coral feet, looking for leftovers from the chickens'
table.

"Say, Wes, I should think you'd have a dog," she said suddenly. "A
nice big dog lazying round here would sort of complete it."
He bent suddenly over his disker and gave the nut he was working on a
mighty twist, but he had tossed aside his hat, and she could see the
sudden jump and darkening of his menacing vein.

"I had a dog," he said in a low voice, "but he died."
A curious restraint fell on them, and for the first time Annie felt
herself an alien, a stranger, far adrift from familiar shores.

She shivered in the light wind.

"You cold? You better go in the house and get something round you,"
Wes said to her.

"I guess I'd better." And she left him hammering.

In the house she found Aunt Dolcey in the big bedroom over the living
room. She had just finished remaking the bed--an old maple four-poster,
the wood a soft and mellowed orange, fine and colourful against the
white quilt, the lace-edged pillow slips.

"I put on clean sheets," said Aunt Dolcey as Annie hesitated on the
threshold. "Yes'm, I put on everything clean, an' the bes'. I know
what's fitten. My chile, dish yer de third bridal bed I made up for
wives of de Dean men."
Something caught in Annie's throat, terrified her. This old black woman,
with her remoteness, her pitying wise eyes, what did she mean?
Annie wanted terribly to ask her. But how begin? How get through this wall
of inscrutability which the black and yellow races have raised for
their protection?

She fluttered nearer to the old woman.

"Look," she began tremulously--"look--it's all right, isn't it, my
marrying him so quick? I haven't got any folks, and--and I suppose
I haven't got much sense; but there was something about him that just
made me trust him and--and want him. But it was all so quick, and--now
I'm here it seems like maybe--there was--something----Oh, you'd tell
me, wouldn't you? It is all right, isn't it?"
The old woman considered. "It's all right ef you're all right," she
pronounced at length.

"But--but what do you mean? And--and look here--Aunt Dolcey--tell
me--what'd he do to that dog he had?"
"What you know 'bout any dog?"
"I don't know--anything; but when I asked him why he didn't
have a dog--he was queer. It scared me."
"Doan be skeered. They ain' nuffin' to be skeered of 'bout Marse Wes.
Eve'ything all right ef you got patience, an' ef you got sense, an' ef
you got haht enough. Sperrit an' sense go far, but the haht gwine
carry you froo. Now I said my say"--her tone mellowed into unctuous
kindness--"what you want, Missy? Som'n Aun' Dolcey c'n fotch you?
Temme what it is, f'r I got to be up an' erbout my wuk. I got er weddin'
cake to mek yit this ebenin'. Yes, ma'am--I gwi' mek you weddin' cake
fill de bigges' pan in de kitchen."
She helped Annie rummage in her trunk and get out the sweater she had
come in for, and it was not until the girl was running back to the
barns that she realized Aunt Dolcey had not answered her question. But
the old woman's words had steadied her, reassured her.

And Wes received her gayly. His repairs were done, his team in harness,
ready to start.

"It's a shame," he said. "We ought to go off down to town and play round
and have a big time, but I'm so behind with my disking, Annie, honey.
You see I had to stay over a day in Baltimore. Fact. Important
business." He winked at her jocosely. "So I've got to work rest of the
day. That's what comes of marrying a farmer. Farm work don't even wait
on a bride, not even the prettiest bride in the world."

He stooped to kiss her, and she held tight to his arm.

"I don't mind. You go on about your business and I'll get all unpacked
and settled. But don't be late to supper--Aunt Dolcey's making us a wedding
cake."
She watched him as he drove down the lane and turned into the field
and steadied the first straining rush of his team. Again she felt her
abandonment, her utter forlornity, her distance from everything she had
known and been accustomed to. But once more she proved herself an
adventurer and a philosopher.

Shrugging her shoulders, she turned back to the house.

"It may be a funny way to get married; but everything's all right until
it stops being all right, and--and I like it here."
* * * * *
She had been married a week now, and the week had been the fairest of
fair weather, indoors as well as out. Now she sat at the clumsy old
secretary desk to write a letter to Miss Tolman.

...

For all you said, and hought I was crazy, I am just as happy as I can
be. Wes is kind and full of fun, and he works very hard.

This farm is a pretty place, and the house is ten times as big as your
shop.

I am learning to cook and churn butter, and Aunt Dolcey, the old
coloured woman, teaches me and doesn't laugh when I am dumb. She says,
and Wes does, too, that I am a born farmer's wife, and I think maybe
I am, for I like it in the country more than I ever thought I'd like any
place, and I don't get a bit lonely. You ought to see our wheat--it's
like green satin, only prettier.

I hope the rheumatism in your hands is better, and that you have got
somebody good in my place. Cousin Lorena, I am a very lucky girl to fall
in love with such a nice man, with a piece of property and a flivver,
even if it is an old one; but better than all that he has is Wes
himself, for you never saw a better, kinder man. He is not rough and
does not chew tobacco as you thought maybe he did, only smokes a
pipe once in a while. I made a sweet-potato custard yesterday, and
he said it was the best he ever tasted. He says I must not do anything
that is too hard for me, but I am going to drop seed corn.

We have been down to town once, and went to the movies and bought
some candy, and he wanted to buy me a new hat, but I wouldn't let
him. He is so kind....

* * * * *
She had written in a glow of happiness, trying to tell everything and
finding it hard to get it into words that would allay Cousin Lorena's
forebodings and impress her properly. Annie frowned at the paper.

How inform a bilious, middle-aged prophet of evil that she had not
only wedded prosperity and industry but also a glorious young
demigod whose tenderness and goodness passed belief?

Suddenly she heard a voice, loud, angry, incoherent. She dropped the
pen and ran out to the kitchen door.

Wes stood there, confronting Uncle Zenas--a Wes she had never dreamed
could exist. The vein on his forehead was black and swollen; indeed
his whole face was distorted with rage.

"You damned old liar--don't you tell me again you put that pitchfork
away when I found it myself in the stable behind the mare's stall.

Pretty business if she'd knocked it down and run one of the tines
into her."
"Marse Wes, you haddat pitchfo'k dere yo'se'f dis mawnin'; I
ain't nevah touch dat pitchfo'k." Unc' Zenas's voice was low and
even.

Behind Wes's back Aunt Dolcey made signs to her husband for silence.

"I tell you you're a liar, and by rights I ought to cut your lying
tongue out of your head! I haven't even seen that pitchfork for three
days, and when I went to look for it just now I found it in the
stable where you'd had it cleaning out the stalls. Now shut up and get
out about your work! Don't let me hear another word out of you!"
Unc' Zenas turned away and Wes, without a word or look at the two
women, strode after him. Annie, shaken, caught Aunt Dolcey's arm.

"Oh, Aunt Dolcey," she breathed, "what on earth was the matter?"
Aunt Dolcey drew her into the kitchen.

"Nuffin' but Marse Wes flyin' int' one his bad Dean temper fits, honey,"
said the old woman "No use to min' him. No use payin' any 'tention.
Dat why I waggle my head at Zenas to say nuffin' back. Talk back to Marse
Wes when he's high-flyin' on'y meks things worse."
Annie beheld an abyss yawning beneath her feet.

"Yes, but, Aunt Dolcey--what's the sense in talking that way?
It wasn't anything, just a pitchfork out of place. And he went on
so. And he looked so dreadful."
Aunt Dolcey rattled her pans.

"I been dreadin' dis moment, whenas you firs' see Marse Wes in his anger.
Zenas an' me, we's use to it. Marse Wes dataway; som'n go wrong he
fly off de handle. Zenas ain't mislay no pitchfo'k--I seed Marse Wes
mahse'f wid dat pitchfo'k dis mawnin'. But eve'y once in a while he git
a temper fit an' blow off he mouf like dat. Sometimes he strike
some-buddy--but he doan often strike Zenas. Sometimes he git mad at
oner de hosses an' frail it proper. Dat high temper run in de Dean
fambly, chile. Dey gits mad, an' dey flies off, an' you just got to stan'
it."
"But does he--does he get over it quick?"
The old negress shook her head.

"He'll be mighty quiet come suppeh-time, not talkin' much, lookin' dahk.
Walk light, an' don't say nuffin' rile him up, eve'ything all
right. T'-morrow mawnin' come, he's outer it." Her voice rose into a
minor cadence, almost a chant. "Chile, it's a dahk shadder on all de
Deans--dey all mahked wid dat frown on deir foreheads, an' dey all got
dahk hours come to um. Marse Wes's maw she fade out an' die caze she
cain' stan' no such. His grammaw, she leave his grampaw. An' so on
back. Ontell some ooman marry a Dean who kin chase dat debbil outer
him, jes so long de Dean men lib in de shadder. I tole you, ain'
I, de day you come, sperrit an' sense carry you fur, but it's de haht
gwine carry you froo. Now you un'stan'."
Yes, Annie understood, imperfectly. So might Red Riding Hood have understood
when the wolf suddenly appeared beside her peaceful pathway. She asked
one more question, "Does he get mad often?" and waited, trembling, for
the answer.

Aunt Dolcey stuck out her underlip.

"Sometime he do, en den again, sometime he doan'. Mos' giner'ly he do."

Annie walked back to her letter, and looked at its last phrase. She
picked up the pen, but did not write.

Then with a quick intake of breath she took her first conscious step in
the path of loyal wifehood.

She added, writing fast: "He is the best man that ever lived, I do
believe," and signed her name, folded the letter and sealed it in its
envelope as quickly as she could.

At supper she watched Wes. He was, as Aunt Dolcey had predicted, very
silent; the vein in his forehead still twitched menacingly and the
pupils of his eyes were distended until the colour about them disappeared
in blackness. After he had eaten he went outside and smoked, while Annie
sat fiddling with a bit of sewing and dreading she knew not what.

But nothing happened. Presently he came in, announced that he was tired
and had a hard day before him to-morrow, and thought he'd go to
bed.

Long after he had fallen into immobile slumber Annie lay beside
him, awake, marvelling how suddenly he had become a stranger, almost
an ogre. Yet she loved him and yearned to him. The impulse that had
made her finish the letter to Cousin Lorena in the same spirit in
which she had begun it called her to pity and help him. She must
conceal his weakness from their world. She listened to his deep,
regular breathing, she put her hand against his hard palm.
"I'm his wife," thought Annie Dean with inarticulate tenderness.
"I'm going to try to be everything a wife ought to be."
The next morning he was his old self again, laughing, joking, teasing
her as usual. The scene of yesterday seemed to have gone utterly
from his memory, though he must have known that she had seen and
heard it.
But he made no allusion to it, nor did she. The farm work was
pressing; the warm spring days foretold an early season.
As he went whistling out toward the barn Annie heard him salute
Unc' Zenas with familiar friendliness:
"How's tricks this morning? Think the Jersey'll be fresh next week?"

Aunt Dolcey heard him, too, and she and Annie exchanged long
glances.
The old woman's said, "You see--what I told you was true"; and the
young woman's answered, "Yes, I see, and I understand. I'm going
to see it through."
But something in her youth had definitely vanished, as it always
does when responsibility lays its heavy hand on us. She went about
her new life questioningly eager for understanding. There was so
much for her to see and learn--the erratic ways of setting hens,
the care of foolish little baby chicks; the spring house, cool and
damp and gray-walled, with its trickle of cold water forever eddying
about the crocks of cream-topped milk; the garden making, left to
her and Aunt Dolcey after the first spading; the various messes and
mashes to be prepared for cows with calf; the use of the stored
vegetables and fruits, and meat dried and salted in such generous
quantity that she marvelled at it. All the farm woman's primer she
learned, bit by bit, seeing how it supplemented and harmonized with
that life of the fields that so engrossed and commanded Wes.
But through it all, beneath it all, she found herself waiting, with
dread, for another outburst. Against whom would it be this time--Unc'
Zenas again--Aunt Dolcey--one of the animals--or perhaps herself?
She wondered if she could bear it if he turned on her.
She was working in the spring house mixing cream with curd for
cottage cheese, very busy and anxious over it, for this was her
first essay alone, when she heard Wes again in anger. She dropped
her spoon, but did not go to look, only concentrated herself to
listen.
This time he was cursing one of his horses, and she could hear the
stinging whish of a whip, a wicked and sinister emphasis to the
beast's snorting and frenzied thumping of hoofs. Her blue eyes
dilated with fear; she knew in what pain and fright the horse must
be lunging under those blows. And Wes, raucous, violent, his mouth
foul with unclean words--only this morning he had told her that
when Sunday came they'd go into the woods and find a wild clematis
to plant beside the front door. Wild clematis! She could have laughed
at the irony of it.
At last she could bear it no longer; she put her hands to her ears
to shut out the hideousness of it. After an interminable wait she
took them down. He had stopped--there was silence--but she heard
footsteps outside, and she literally cowered into the darkest corner
of the spring house. But it was only Aunt Dolcey, her lips set in
a line of endurance.
"I was lookin' erbout foh you, honey," she said reassuringly. "I
di'n' know where you was, en den I remembah you come off down heah.
Let Aunt Dolcey finish up dat cheese."
"What--what started him?" asked Annie piteously.
"I doan' jes' know--sound' like one de big team di'n' go inter his
right stall, er som'n like dat. It's always som'n triflin', en no
'count. But land, he'll be ovah it come night. Doan' look so white
en skeer, chile."
"But--but I been thinking--what if he might turn on me--what if
he'd strike me? Aunt Dolcey--did he ever strike you?"
"Oncet." 
"Oh, Aunt Dolcey, what did you do?"
Something flared in Aunt Dolcey's eyes that was as old as her
race.
She looked past Annie as if she saw something she rather relished;
just so her ancestors must have looked when they were dancing before
a bloodstained Congo fetish.
"You see dat big white scar on Marse Wes' lef' wris'? When he struck
me I mahk him dere wid my hot flatiron. Am' no man eveh gwine lif'
his hand to Dolcey, no matter who."One morning, just as they were setting forth to
their work, the dreaded war whoop of the Indians was heard.  Two or
three hundred Red Indian warriors, armed with spears, rifles, and round
shields, were seen galloping towards the devoted village.  Some of the
people fled.  All tried to flee, for so completely unprepared were they
that there was no time to make any defence.  The women and children, as
they were overtaken, were indiscriminately slaughtered.  The plunder
that was considered worth carrying off was collected, and then in
wantonness the village was set on fire.  A few of the fugitives had at
length reached Durango with the tale of their misfortunes.  Some troops
had been sent out with orders to exterminate the savages, but they took
very good care not to come near them, while the Indians indeed were
probably making a foray some two or three hundred miles away.  At night
we reached a rancho, the owner of which was known to our friends.  He
received us hospitably, slung hammocks for us in one of the corridors of
the house, and gave us the usual tortillas, and eggs, and beans for a
feast, in addition to some very fine beef.  The evening of the next day
was approaching, when, as we were descending a hill, we saw in the plain
below us a number of horsemen galloping about.  We were too far off to
make out what they were.  The rancheroes gazed earnestly at them.  Mr
Renshaw had a good glass with him.

"Why, there are red fellows on horseback, with spears and shields, but
without a rag on them," he exclaimed.  "They seem to be fighting with
another set of fellows dressed as Spaniards, and, hang it, the latter
are turning heels and flying."  The rancheroes seemed very much excited
all the time, and rode a little way down the hill, that they might
better see what was going on.  They quickly turned round and beckoned to
us to join them.  We did so, and soon saw that if we would save the
lives of the Mexicans, there was not a moment to be lost.  Although
there were thirty of them, there were fully four times as many Indians.
It was not difficult to divine what had occurred.  The Mexicans had been
taken by surprise, and instead of pulling up and keeping close together,
each man had galloped off in the hope of saving his own life, without
thinking of his companions.  The Indians had thus got in among them, and
had already pierced several through with their long spears.  Each Indian
warrior, however, as soon as he had killed or disabled a man, stopped to
take his scalp, and this gave time to some of the Mexicans once more to
unite and to present a better front to the enemy.  The resistance they
were making, however, was very feeble, and as we galloped on we saw that
they had once more begun to break.  The Indians had been so intent on
the attack that they had not perceived our approach, neither had the
Mexicans.

"Now, my friends," exclaimed our friend Captain Driscoll, who seemed as
if by right to take the command, "keep together, shoulder to shoulder,
and dash boldly in among those red villains.  Cut them down, and pistol
them as best you can, shouting at the top of your voices.  I know them
of old; they won't stand that.  When they hear English voices they'll
run; they know what they are to get.  Wait till I give the word,
though."

It was very exciting.  Down the steep hill we dashed at full speed, our
horses seeming clearly to understand what we were about.  Already
several more Mexicans had, through their cowardice, lost their lives.
We were within two hundred yards of the scene of strife.  "Now's the
time!" shouted our leader.  "Hurrah, hurrah! my lads!  Give way, you red
scoundrels!" we all shouted at the top of our voices.  The Indians,
hearing our cries, turned their heads, and seeing a large body of
horsemen coming down the road, and not knowing how many there might be
following, thought that it was high time for them to be off.  Our
appearance, also, gave the Mexicans courage, and they charged more
manfully than they had done before.

"Wallop ahoo aboo, Erin gobragh!" sung out our leader, Captain Driscoll.
"Fly, ye red scoundrels; fly, or we will cut you into mince-meat!"
Whether the Indians understood what he said I do not know, but as he
suited the action to the word, wielding a pretty heavy Toledo, they took
his advice, and, disengaging themselves from the melee, urged their
horses to a rapid flight.  We, however, were too close to them to allow
them to escape altogether with impunity, and three of them were knocked
off the backs of their steeds, two of whom were mortally wounded.  A
third, I thought, was lead.  He lay on the ground without moving, or
apparently breathing, his tomahawk still held in his death-grasp.  The
cowardly Mexicans very soon put the other two poor wretches out of their
pain, by running them through and through with their lances.  Two or
three of the heroes were in the act of charging the dead man, with the
intention of running him through, when up he sprung to his feet, and
away he went as quick almost, it seemed, as a flash of lightning after
his comrades!  Several of our party gave chase after him, but though he
was on foot it appeared as if he would distance us.  His leg, however,
had been wounded, and he had miscalculated his strength.  His pace
slackened.  Once or twice he stumbled; he felt that he could run no
more.  He was a brave fellow, and was determined to die like a man, with
his face to his enemies.  Flourishing his tomahawk above his head, he
uttered his war cry, and rushed desperately towards us.  A Mexican's
lance struck him on the shoulder, and brought him to the ground.  The
other Mexicans were about to despatch him, but Captain Driscoll sung out
in Spanish, "Spare his life; spare his life; we do not kill fallen
enemies;" and Jerry and I, impelled by the same feelings, threw
ourselves before him, and by signs showed that we had resolved to
protect him.  The Indian seemed to comprehend what we were about, though
perhaps he thought we wanted to preserve his life only to torture him,
for he did not show that he was in any way obliged to us.  The moment
the lance was withdrawn, he sprung up with his weapon in his hand, ready
to fight on; but one of the rancheroes threw his lasso over his
shoulders, and, with a jerk which, had it been round his neck, would
have dislocated it, brought him again to the ground.

"We will bring him along with us," said Captain Driscoll; "the poor
wretch has shown great courage, and deserves to live.  Perhaps we may
learn from him something about his tribe."

The captive Indian was dragged along; and, finding that at present he
had no chance of escape, he came on quietly.  No less than eight of the
Mexicans had lost their lives, so sudden had been the attack of the red
men, and most of the bodies had been deprived of their scalps.  As it
was impossible to carry the corpses with us, and we had not time to bury
them, they were left to afford a banquet to the birds of the air and the
beasts of the forest--a common occurrence in this country.  Some of
those who had run away now came back, and by degrees the whole party was
once more collected together.  It was already late in the afternoon, and
we were anxious to find some place where we could rest for the night.
There was a village, we heard, at no great distance, and by riding
pretty hard we might reach it by nightfall.  After what had occurred,
this we were all well disposed to do, for we could not tell at what
moment the Comanches, when they found that our numbers were smaller than
they had supposed, might come back and attack us.  It was amusing to
hear the vapouring and boasting of the Mexicans, as our friends, with
their own comments, translated it to us.  The greatest boasters were the
greatest cowards.  Not one but could offer an excellent reason for
having run away.  Several were going to procure help; others to get
behind the Indians, to attack them in the rear; others were heroically
making a diversion, to draw off their attention from their friends.  It
was nearly dark when we reached the village, but not a sign of living
beings was there--no dog barked, no child's cheerful voice was heard,
not a cock crew.  Alas! there were blackened roofs and walls, and
charred door-posts.  The Indians had been there; all the inhabitants
must have been slain or had fled.  We rode through the hamlet; not a
human being was to be found.  One house--the largest in the place--had
escaped entire destruction.  It had two stories; a ladder led to the
upper one.  It would afford us shelter during the night, which gave
signs of being a tempestuous one.  Behind the house were some sheds,
where our horses might be tethered.  Seymour, the Duke of Portland, Lord
Balfour of Burleigh, Lord Desborough, Lord Lovat, Mr. Rudyard Kipling,
Sir W. Ramsay, F.R.S., the Dean of Canterbury, Professors Dicey and
Goudy, Sir George Hayter Chubb, and Mr. Salvidge, the influential alderman
of Liverpool. On the 6th of March Mr. Walter Long, writing from the office
of the Union Defence League, of which he was President, was able to
inform Carson that there was "a rush to sign the Covenant--we are
really almost overpowered." This was supplemented by a women's Covenant,
which, like the men's, "had been numerously and influentially signed,
about 3 or 4 per cent, of the signatories, it was said, being Liberals."[62]
Long believed from this and other evidence that had reached him that
"public opinion was now really aroused in the country," and that the
steadfast policy of Ulster had the undoubted support of the electorate.

Only those who were in the confidence of Mr. Asquith and his colleagues
at the beginning of 1914 can know whether the "proposals" they then made
were ever seriously put forward as an effort towards appeasement. If
they were sincerely meant for such, it implied a degree of ignorance
of the chief factor in the problem with which it is difficult to credit
able Ministers who had been face to face with that problem for
years.
They must have supposed that their leading opponents were capable
of saying emphatically one thing and meaning quite another. For the
Unionist leaders had stated over and over again in the most unmistakable
terms, both in the recent debate on the Address, and on innumerable
former occasions, that nothing except the "exclusion of Ulster"
could furnish a basis for negotiation towards settlement.

And yet, when the Prime Minister at last put his cards on the table on
the 9th of March, in moving the second reading of the Home Rule
Bill--which now entered on its third and last lap under the Parliament
Act--it was found that his much-trumpeted proposals were derisory to
the last degree. The scheme was that which came to be known as county
option with a time limit. Any county in Ulster, including the
cities of Belfast and Derry, was to be given the right to vote itself
out of the Home Rule jurisdiction, on a requisition signed by a
specified proportion of its parliamentary electorate, for a period of
six years.

Mr. Bonar Law said at once, on behalf of the Unionist Party, that
apart from all other objections to the Government scheme, and they
were many, the time limit for exclusion made the whole proposal a mockery.
All that it meant was that when the preparations in Ulster for resistance
to Home Rule had been got rid of--for it would be practically
impossible to keep them in full swing for six years--Ulster should
then be compelled to submit to the very thing to which she refused
to submit now.

Carson described the proposal as a "sentence of death with a stay
of execution for six years."

He noted with satisfaction indeed the admission of the principle of
exclusion, but expressed his conviction that the time limit had
been introduced merely in order to make it impossible for Ulster
to accept. Ulster wanted the question settled once for all, so that
she might turn her attention from politics to her ordinary business.

The time limit would keep the fever of political agitation at a high
temperature for six years, and at the end of that period forcible
resistance would be as necessary as ever, while in the interval all
administration would be paralysed by the unworkable nature of the
system to be introduced for six years. Although there were other gross
blots on the scheme outlined by the Prime Minister, yet, if the
time limit were dropped, Carson said he would submit it to a convention
in Belfast; but he utterly declined to do so if the time limit was to
be retained.

The debate was adjourned indefinitely, and before it could be resumed
the whole situation was rendered still more grave by the events to be
narrated in the next chapter, and by a menacing speech delivered by
Mr.
Churchill at Bradford on the 14th of March. He hinted that, if Ulster
persisted in refusing the offer made by the Prime Minister, which
was the Government's last word, the forces of the Crown would have
to be employed against her; there were, he said, "worse things than
bloodshed even on an extended scale"; and he ended by saying, "Let us
go forward together and put these grave matters to the proof."[63] Two
days later Mr. Asquith, in answer to questions in the House of
Commons, announced that no particulars of the Government scheme would
be given unless the principle of the proposals were accepted as a basis
of agreement.

The leader of the Unionist Party replied by moving a vote of censure
on the Government on the 19th of March. Mr. Churchill's Bradford speech,
and one no less defiant by Mr. Devlin the day following it, had charged
with inflammable material the atmosphere in which the debate was
conducted.

Sir Edward Carson began his speech by saying that, after these recent
events, "I feel that I ought not to be here, but in Belfast." There were
some sharp passages between him and Churchill, whom he accused of being
anxious to provoke the Ulster people to make an attack on the soldiers.
A highly provocative speech by Mr. Devlin followed, at the end of which
Carson rose and left the House, saying audibly, "I am off to Belfast."
He was accompanied out of the Chamber by eight Ulster members, and was
followed by ringing and sustained cheers of encouragement and
approval from the crowded Unionist benches. It was a scene which those
who witnessed it are not likely to forget.

The idea of accommodation between the combatant parties was at an end.

CHAPTER XVI
THE CURRAGH INCIDENT

When Mr. Bonar Law moved the vote of censure on the Government on the
19th of March he had no idea that the Cabinet had secretly taken in hand
an enterprise which, had it been known, would have furnished infinitely
stronger grounds for their impeachment than anything relating to
their "proposals" for amending the Home Rule Bill. It was an enterprise
that, when it did become known, very nearly brought about their
fall from power.

The whole truth about the famous "Curragh Incident" has never been
ascertained, and the answers given by the Ministers chiefly concerned,
under cross-examination in the House of Commons, were so evasive
and in several instances so contradictory as to make it certain
that they were exceedingly anxious that the truth should be concealed.

But when the available evidence is pieced together it leads almost
irresistibly to the conclusion that in March 1914 the Cabinet, or
at any rate some of the most prominent members of it, decided to
make an imposing demonstration of military force against Ulster,
and that they expected, if they did not hope, that this operation
would goad the Ulstermen into a clash with the forces of the Crown,
which, by putting them morally in the wrong, would deprive them of
the popular sympathy they enjoyed in so large and increasing a
measure.

When Mr. Churchill spoke at Bradford on the 14th of March of "putting these
grave matters to the proof" he was already deeply involved in what
came to be known as "the plot against Ulster," to which his words were
doubtless an allusion. That plot may perhaps have originated at
Mr.
Lloyd George's breakfast-table on the 11th, when he entertained
Mr.
Redmond, Mr. Dillon, Mr. Devlin, Mr. O'Connor, and the Chief Secretary
for Ireland, Mr. Birrell; for on the same day it was decided to send
a squadron of battleships with attendant cruisers and destroyers from
the coast of Spain to Lamlash, in the Isle of Arran, opposite Belfast
Lough; and a sub-committee of the Cabinet, consisting of Lord Crewe,
Mr.
Churchill, Colonel Seely, Mr. Birrell, and Sir John Simon, was
appointed to deal with affairs connected with Ulster. This
sub-committee held its first meeting the following day, and the next was
the date of Mr.
Churchill's threatening speech at Bradford, with its reference to the
prospect of bloodshed and of putting grave matters to the proof.
Bearing in mind this sequence of events, it is not easy to credit
the contention of the Government, after the plot had been discovered,
that the despatch of the fleet to the neighbourhood of the Ulster
coast had no connection with the other naval and military operations
which immediately followed.

For on the 14th, while Churchill was travelling in the train to
Bradford, Seely, the Secretary of State for War, was drafting a letter
to Sir Arthur Paget, the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, informing him
of reports (it was never discovered where the reports, which were without
the smallest foundation, came from) that attempts might be made "in
various parts of Ireland by evil-disposed persons" to raid Government
stores of arms and ammunition, and instructing the General to "take
special precautions" to safeguard the military depots. It was added
that "information shows that Armagh, Omagh, Carrickfergus, and Enniskillen
are insufficiently guarded."[64] It is permissible to wonder, if
there was danger from evil-disposed persons "in various parts of
Ireland," from whom came the information that the places particularly
needing reinforcements were a ring of strategically important towns round
the outskirts of the loyalist counties of Ulster.

Whatever the source of the alleged "information"--whether it originated
at Mr. Lloyd George's breakfast-table or elsewhere--Seely evidently
thought it alarmingly urgent, for within forty-eight hours he telegraphed
to Paget asking for a reply before 8 a.m. next morning as to what steps
he had taken, and ordering the General to come at once to London, bringing
with him detailed plans. On the 16th Sir A. Paget telegraphed that he
"had taken all available steps"; but, on second thoughts, he wrote on
the 17th saying that there were sufficient troops at Enniskillen to
guard the depot, that he was making a small increase to the
detachment at Carrickfergus, and that, instead of strengthening the
garrisons of Omagh and Armagh, the stores there were being removed--an
operation that would take eight days. He explained his reason for this
departure from instructions to be that such a movement of troops
as had been ordered by the War Office would, "in the present state of
the country, create intense excitement in Ulster and possibly precipitate
a crisis."[65]
As soon as this communication reached the War Office orders were sent
that the arms and ammunition at Omagh and Armagh, for the safety
of which from evil-disposed persons Seely had been so apprehensive,
were not to be removed, although they had already been packed for
transport.
This order was sent on the 18th of March, and on the same day Sir
Arthur Paget arrived in London from Ireland and had a consultation
with the Ulster sub-committee of the Cabinet, and with Sir John
French and other members of the Army Council at the War Office.

News of this meeting reached the ears of Sir Edward Carson, who was also
aware that a false report was being spread of attempts by Unionists
to influence the Army, and in his speech on the vote of censure on the
19th he said: "I have never suggested that the Army should not be
sent to Ulster. I have never suggested that it should not do its duty
when sent there. I hope and expect it will." At the same time reports
were circulating in Dublin--did they come from Downing Street?--that
the Government were preparing to take strong measures against the
Ulster Unionist Council, and to arrest the leaders. In allusion to these
reports the Dublin Correspondent of _The Times_ telegraphed on the 18th
of March: "Any man or Government that increases the danger by blundering
or hasty action will accept a terrible responsibility."
What passed at the interviews which Sir Arthur Paget had with Ministers
on the 18th and 19th has never been disclosed. But it is clear, from
the events which followed, either that an entirely new plan on a much
larger scale was now inaugurated, or that a development now took place
which Churchill and Seely, and perhaps other Ministers also, had contemplated
from the beginning and had concealed behind the pretended insignificance
of precautions to guard depots. It is noteworthy, at all events, that
the measures contemplated happened to be the stationing of troops
in considerable strength in important strategical positions round
Ulster, simultaneously with the despatch of a powerful fleet to within
a few hours of Belfast.

The orders issued by the War Office, at any rate, indicated something
on a far bigger scale than the original pretext could justify.
Paget's fear of precipitating a crisis was brushed aside, and General
Friend, who was acting for him in Dublin during his absence, was
instructed by telegram to send to the four Ulster towns more than
double the number of men that Paget had deemed would be sufficient to
protect the Government stores.
But still more significant was another order given to Friend on the
18th.

The Dorset Regiment, quartered in the Victoria Barracks in Belfast,
were to be moved four miles out to Holywood, taking with them their
stores and ammunition, amounting to some thirty tons; and such was the
anxiety of the Government to get the troops out of the city that
they were told to leave their rifles behind, if necessary, after rendering
them useless by removing the bolts.[66] The Government had vetoed
Paget's plan of removing the stores from Omagh and Armagh, because their
real object was to increase the garrisons at those places; but, as they
had no scruple about moving the much larger supply from the Victoria
Barracks through the most intensely Orange quarter of Belfast, it could
hardly be wondered at if such an order, under the circumstances, was
held to give colour to the idea that Ministers wished to provoke violent
opposition to the troops. Not less inconsistent with the original pretext
was the despatch of a battalion to Newry and Dundalk. At the latter
place there was already a brigade of artillery, with eighteen guns,
which would prove a tough nut for "evil-disposed persons" to crack;
and although both towns would be important points to hold with an army
making war on Ulster, they were both in Nationalist territory where there
could be no fear of raids by Unionists. Yet the urgency was considered
so great at the War Office to occupy these places in strength not later
than the 20th that two cruisers were ordered to Kingstown to take
the troops to Dundalk by sea, if there should be difficulty about
land transport.

Whatever may have been the actual design of Mr. Churchill and Colonel
Seely, who appear to have practically taken the whole management of
the affair into their own hands, the dispositions must have suggested
to anyone with elementary knowledge of military matters that nothing
less than an overpowering attack on Belfast was in contemplation. The
transfer of the troops from Victoria Barracks, where they would have
been useful to support the civil power in case of rioting, to
Holywood, where they would be less serviceable for that purpose but
where they would be in rapid communication by water with the garrison of
Carrickfergus on the opposite shore of the Lough; the ordering of
H.M.S.
_Pathfinder_ and _Attentive_ to Belfast Lough, where they were to
arrive "at daybreak on Saturday the 21st instant" with instructions
to support the soldiers if necessary "by guns and search-lights from
the ships[67]"; the secret and rapid garrisoning of strategic points
on all the railways leading to Belfast,--all this pointed, not to
the safeguarding of stores of army boots and rifles, but to operations
of an offensive campaign.

It was in this light that the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland himself
interpreted his instructions, and, seeing that he had taken the
responsibility of not fully obeying the much more modest orders he had
received in Ireland on the 14th, it is easy to understand that he thought
the steps now to be taken would lead to serious consequences. He also
foresaw that he might have trouble with some of the officers under his
command, for before leaving London he persuaded the Secretary of
State and Sir John French to give the following permission: "Officers
actually domiciled in Ulster would be exempted from taking part in
any operation that might take place.

They would be permitted to 'disappear' [that being the exact phrase
used by the War Office], and when all was over would be allowed to
resume their places without their career or position being affected."[68]

Having obtained this concession, Sir Arthur Paget returned the same night
to Dublin, where he arrived on the 20th and had a conference with his
general officers.

He told them of the instructions he had received, which the
Government called "precautionary" and believed "would be carried out
without resistance." The Commander-in-Chief did not share the Government's
optimism. He thought "that the moves would create intense
excitement," that by next day "the country would be ablaze," and
that the result might be "active operations against organised bodies
of the Ulster Volunteer Force under their responsible leaders."

With regard to the permission for officers domiciled in Ulster to
"disappear," he informed his generals that any other officers who were
not prepared to carry out their duty would be dismissed the Service.

There was, apparently, some misunderstanding as to whether officers
without an Ulster domicile who objected to fight against Ulster were
to say so at once and accept dismissal, or were to wait until they
received some specific order which they felt unable to obey. Many
of the officers understood the General to mean the former of these
two alternatives, and the Colonel of one line regiment gave his
officers half an hour to make up their minds on a question affecting
their whole future career; every one of them objected to going against
Ulster, and "nine or ten refused under any condition" to do so.[69] Another
regimental commanding officer told his subordinates that "steps have
been taken in Ulster so that any aggression must come from the
Ulsterites, and they will have to shed the first blood," on which his
comment was: "The idea of provoking Ulster is hellish."[70]
In consequence of what he learnt at the conference with his generals
on the morning of the 20th Sir Arthur Paget telegraphed to the War
Office:
"Officer Commanding 5th Lancers states that all officers except
two, and one doubtful, are resigning their commissions to-day. I
much fear same conditions in the 16th Lancers. Fear men will refuse
to move[71]"; and later in the day he reported that the "Brigadier
and 57 officers, 3rd Cavalry Brigade, prefer to accept dismissal
if ordered north."[72] Next day he had to add that the Colonel and
all the officers of the 4th Hussars had taken up the same attitude.[73]

This was very disconcerting news for the War Office, where it had
been taken for granted that very few, if any, officers, except
perhaps a few natives of Ulster, would elect to wreck their careers,
if suddenly confronted with so terrible a choice, rather than take
part in operations against the Ulster Loyalists. Instructions were
immediately wired to Paget in Dublin to "suspend any senior officers
who have tendered their resignations"; to refuse to accept the
resignation of junior officers; and to send General Gough, the
Brigadier in command of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, and the commanding
officers of the two Lancer regiments and the 4th Hussars, to report
themselves promptly at the War Office after relieving them of their
commands.We joined ourselves to them.  Each of us had a rifle slung
to his back, in addition to a week's provisions and our mining utensils,
while our pistols and knives were stuck in our belts.  We went on for
two days pretty easily.  I shall never forget the appearance of some
people we met, who had come overland from the western states of
America,--their haggard eyes, long matted hair, shrunk forms, and
tattered clothes, which hung on them like loose rags fluttering in the
wind.  They were the remnants of a large party, the greater number of
whom with their horses and cattle had died on the way, from the
hardships they had to encounter.  The latter part of the road, they
said, was strewed with the whitening bones of men and animals,
broken-down waggons, and abandoned furniture.  The next day's journey
gave us a specimen of what those poor fellows had endured.  The sun came
out with intense fury, and struck scorching down on our heads.  Not a
drop of water could be got.  There was a pool, we were told, some way
on.  We reached the spot: it was dry.  Our thirst grew intolerable.
Those who had been accustomed to take spirits suffered more than the
rest.  We lay down that night at a place where there was no wood.  We
had no fire, therefore, to cook our provisions.  We could not eat the
meat we had brought with us raw.  All night long the wolves howled
horribly in our ears.  At daybreak we arose and pushed on.  There was a
water-hole, we were told, a few miles ahead.  We reached the spot: it
was dry.  Many who had hitherto held out gave way to despair.  The
muleteers had skins with water, but they guarded them, revolver in hand,
to moisten their own and their mules' lips.  Their lives depended on
those of their animals.  A few of us had flasks, but we could only
venture to take a drop of the precious fluid at a time.  One man had a
bottle of brandy.  He boasted at first of his cleverness in having
secured it.  Now, he went about offering the whole of it for a drop of
water.  Several of the brandy drinkers sank down.  They had agreed to
keep together.  They implored us to help them.  A deaf ear was turned to
their entreaties.  Our own lives depended on our hastening on.  Three or
four others dropped by the way, one by one.  No one waited for them.
`On, on, on!' was the cry; `Water, water, water!'  At length, towards
evening, the mules pricked up their ears: trees appeared in the
distance.  We hurried on.  A glittering stream gladdened our sight.  We
rushed into it, greedily lapping up the water.  Our mules drank eagerly.
We felt revived and strengthened.  There was abundance of wood: we
lighted a fire and dressed our provisions.  Several birds, and two or
three animals were shot to increase our feast.

"Ha, ha, ha, how we laughed.  To-morrow, we said, we shall be able to
push on to the mines, and begin to dig for gold.  In an instant every
one was talking of gold.  `Gold, gold, gold,' was heard on every side.
Later they found out he had overtaken the tramp, fought him again, knocked
him out, and then, roping him, had taken him to the nearest constable
and seen him committed to jail. But the encounter left him strange and

clack of the returning coffeepot, boiling up the hill at an unwonted
speed. And she waved her hand to Wes as he came past; but he was
bent over the wheel and did not even look round for her, only banged
the little car round to the dorsum furiously. Something in his attitude
warned her, and she felt the old almost-forgotten devil of her fear leap
to clutch her heart. Presently he came round the house, and she hardly

mind. He was sitting opposite her now, his head in his hands,

to force herself to believe that Wes would not commit this crime against

he would. She went over it and over it, in stubborn troubled wakefulness.
She put it in clear if simple terms. If Wes persisted in his petty childish
anger and wasted this wheat, it meant that they could not save the
money the first time that she had seen Wes angry, and how she had
lain to awake then and wondered, and dreaded. She remembered how, later,

At the that touch--the first harshness she had felt him--something
hot and flaming leaped through her. She whirled away from him and
caught up Aunt Dolcey's big sharp butcher knife lying on the table;
lifted it." You put you are." She dropped the knife and walked past

she mounted grimly to the seat. She did not even look around to see if
Wes might be watching. She did not answer when Unc' Zenas offered a

Slowly pushing the door open, he stood hesitate on the threshold
of the studio. Big Chap looked up from his easel by the window. His
eyes kindled into a kindly smile, its welcoming effect offset by an
admonitory headshake." Not now, Son," he said." I'm busy."" Can't I
stay a little while, Daddy?" The sturdy little legs carried their
owner across the floor as he spoke." I'll be quiet, like--like
I was" the youngster was saying, conversationally easing the
embarrassment of liberally a possible capitulation." Mummy says I ought
to be proud of them, and I'm five years old." The artist looked gravely
down at him." Proud, Son?" he asked in the peculiar way he had
of reasoning with the Little Chap." Have you reached the age of five

loyalty. And whenever England engaged in a war, however and of the

anything you have done? Or did you acquire the trousers with money you
earned?" The Little Chap looked up at questioningly. He had inherited
his mother's wide gray eyes, and at present their expression was
troubled.

Then, evidently seeking a more easily comprehended topic, his eyes left
his father's and sought the canvas on kingly figure in the picture,
then wandered away to the window through which he seemed to lose himself
in scenes of which was depicted the lines were heavy in her hands, dragged
at her arms. It was hot, and sweat rolled down her forehead. She wished
vaguely that she had remembered to put on her sunbonnet. Behind her

well-capped stocks, little rough golden castles to prominent figure in
the painting. His father continued to regard him thoughtfully." One of
England's kings, Son."" And what did_he_ do to be proud of?" came quickly
from the youthful inquisitioner. A hearty laugh escaped the artist."
Bully for you, Son! That's a poser! Aside from taxing the poor and having
enemies beheaded, very I'm puzzled to know what he really did do to
earn his high position. The Little Chap squirmed himself between
need. He flung his hat on ground before her with a gesture of frantic
violence. When he spoke the words came in a ferment of fury:" That
skunk of a Harrison says he wo n't bring the thresher up his father's
knees and started to scale the heights to his lap, where he finally
settled down with a sigh of comfort."

Tell me a story about him," he said eagerly." A story with castles,'n'

they had intended for the that was."

cloth and out to present it to the King. tyrant the hat reach its
destination.
Our friend told
us that he had constantly made inquiries among the chiefs and natives as
to the affair, and that he is certain the attack on the whites was not
premeditated.  Some of the people had stolen a boat for the sake of the
nails in her, with which they wished to make fish-hooks.  He landed with
some boats to recover it.  While speaking to some of the chiefs on the
subject, a number of natives collected; and without his orders the
marines, believing that he was about to be attacked, fired.  A chief was
killed.  The natives advanced, and, while he was in the act of ordering
his people to desist, he was pierced through the body by a spear.  Grief
and dismay took possession of the hearts of both parties when he fell.
By the then superstitious natives he had been looked upon as their
deified and long-lost sovereign, Rono.  This Rono (so their legends
asserted) had in a fit of anger killed his wife, when, repenting of the
act, his senses deserted him, and he went about the islands wrestling
with whomsoever he met.  At last he took his departure in a vessel of a
strange build, and no one knew where he had gone, but all expected him
to return.  When Captain Cook appeared, the priests believed that he was
Rono, and, clothing him with the garments kept for their god, led him to
their temples, and offered sacrifices to propitiate his favour, while
the people prostrated themselves before him--he all the time little
suspecting the reason of the honours paid him.  After his death some of
the people naturally doubted that he could be Rono, but others still
affirmed that he was; and it is believed that the priests took some of
his bones and preserved them in a wicker basket covered over with red
feathers, which are highly prized by the natives.  In this they were
every year carried about from temple to temple, when the priests went to
collect tribute of the people.  After the abolition of idolatry in 1819,
it is not known what became of them; perhaps they were concealed by some
old priest who still clung secretly to the ancient faith.

Talking of nails, it is extraordinary what excellent fish-hooks the
natives will manufacture out of them.  They prefer them to the best made
in England.  They still set a high value on them; but they are not quite
so simple-minded as some of the Friendly islanders we heard of, who, on
obtaining some nails, planted them, in the hope of obtaining a large
crop from the produce!  Scarcely had we dropped our anchor when we were
surrounded by the canoes of the natives, who wore but the primitive
maro.  They brought off bread-fruits, cocoa-nuts, bananas, and other
products of the soil, in the hope of thus making themselves welcome.
One of them, who spoke English tolerably, undertook to pilot our boat on
shore.  We were eager to land.  As we pulled in, a number of men, women,
and children, came down to welcome us.  The men, like those in the
canoes, wore the taro, but the women were dressed with the loose blue
gowns I have described, and with wreaths of flowers round their heads.
We ran in among the masses of lava which lined the shore, and were
kindly helped by the people to land.  We observed that they were all
especially grave, for nowhere are more merry creatures found than the
native women.  As we walked along they followed us in silence.  At
length our guide stopped and pointed to the ground on which we stood.

"There, white men--there, friends--there it was your great sea-chieftain
fell."  He repeated, we found, the same words in his own language.  The
natives listened to what he said, and then hung their heads ashamed, as
if they had been guilty of the sad deed.  We broke off several pieces of
the lava from about the spot, to take to our friends at home, and sent
them on board the schooner.  We were to accompany the missionary
overland to Kailua, where the schooner was to meet us.  After the
missionary had spoken to the people, we were anxious to proceed on our
journey, and one of the principal natives, who lived a few miles to the
north, insisted that we should remain at his hut for the night; and we,
accordingly, gladly accompanied him.  We found the feast preparing
outside the door, in the usual oven.  Knowing that Englishmen have an
objection to eat dogs, he had killed a fatted pig.  The oven was a
simple affair.  A hole was dug in the earth, in which a large fire was
lighted upon some stones, till all the earth around was hot; piggy was
then put in, and the hole was covered up with loose earth; clouds of
steam then issued from the earth, and when no more was perceptible the
meat was declared to be cooked properly.  We all sat round on mats in
the primitive fashion, the food being placed before us either in
calabashes or on large leaves.  Instead of bread we had the bread-fruit.
It has somewhat the flavour of bread, and answers its purpose, but has
neither the appearance nor consistence of our staff of life.  It is
about the size of the shaddock, and, when fresh gathered, the flavour of
the citron; but it is always eaten baked, when it has the solidity of a
roasted chestnut.  Besides these luxuries, we had some fish nicely
cooked, which we ate with the thick interior of the cocoa-nut, which may
truly be called the cream, while the juice served to quench our thirst.
We had a number of visitors, who all, both men and women, chatted away
most merrily, especially the women, who kept up a continued peal of
laughter.  At night the hut was lighted up with chips of a resinous
wood, called kukia, which were stuck all round on the posts which
supported the roof; and when we expressed a wish to retire to rest, mats
were hung up to partition off our sleeping chambers.

It is, I find, impossible to describe all the interesting habits and
customs we observed of this primitive people.  The next day about noon
we found ourselves, on issuing from a grove of cocoa-nut trees, on the
shore of a beautiful bay, with high black rocks running out on either
side, and a yellow, sandy beach.  From the way the sea broke, first with
great violence, and then a second time with diminished force, there were
evidently two lines of coral reefs, one without the other.  A number of
people were seated on the rocks watching with great interest what was
going forward.  Some men, women, and children were in the water, while
others with their boards, about a foot wide and four feet long, in their
hands, were preparing to follow them.  Placing the boards on the water,
they threw themselves on them, and then swam out, diving under the
breakers of the inner bar, and appearing on the in-shore side of the
outer one.  The great art appeared to be, to remain on the steep slope
of the outer sea-roller as it swept majestically on towards the land,
and then, just before it broke, to dive under it, and to reappear
mounting up the side of the following watery hill.  Sometimes a lad
would keep above water too long, and the surf would roll him over, and
carry away his board; but he quickly recovered it, and soon regained his
credit.  Shouts of laughter bursting forth on all sides when any such
mishap occurred, showed that there was little fear of damage.  The women
and children kept generally on the inner bar, but were quite as expert
as the men.  On mounting to the top of the rocks we saw two of the men
swim out beyond the rest, on the further side of the breakers.  The
natives seemed to be watching them attentively.  Soon one of them was
seen to dive, then the other.  In a little time they both appeared,
flourishing their knives above their heads, and at the same moment two
huge black bodies floated to the surface, and were borne in by the
rollers towards the shore.

"What can they be?"  I exclaimed to Jerry.

"Sharks," he answered, watching them.  "Well, I should like to know how
to tackle to with one of these monsters.  I own that I shouldn't much
like to have to fight one of them with a suit of armour on, and a spear
or battle-axe in my hand.  I suspect even Saint George who killed the
dragon would have found it somewhat a tough job, and yet these naked
fellows make no difficulty about the matter."

"It is just what a man has been used to," I answered.  "I daresay one of
them would be very unhappy with a suit of armour on and a battle-axe."

No surprise seemed to be created by the achievement, and the bold
swimmers took their places among the rest on the rollers as if nothing
had happened.  When swimming out in this way, every man has a knife
secured to his board.  As soon as he sees a shark, he swims away a short
distance.  The shark approaches--he pretends to be very awkward.

about it, little, because being wiser than men they escape much anguish.
Yet sometimes the dwarfs leave their deep grottoes and seek the
pitiless surface of the earth to mingle with men so as to love them,
to suffer with them and through them, and thus to feel this pity which
refreshes the soul like a heavenly dew. This is the truth concerning
men, Loc. But did you not ask me as to the exact fate of some one amongst
them?" King Loc having repeated his question, Nur looked into one of

contagion of directions spread from place to place until the whole
interior of the earth was shaken if with a mighty and jovial hiccough.

Blanchelande King Loc not laugh long; indeed he conceal the face of a
very unhappy little man under the bed-clothes. He lay awake all
night long thinking of George of Blanchelande it, the prisoner of
the nixies. So about the hour when such of the dwarfs as have a dairymaid
for sweetheart go in her stead to milk the cows while she sleeps in her
white bed with folded hands, little King Loc again sought the
astute Nur in the depths his well." You did not tell me, Nur,
what he is doing down there with the nixies?" The venerable Nur was quite
convinced that the king was mad, that did not alarm because he knew
if and full of the most delicious fancies. But King Loc was not mad; at
least not more so than lovers usually are." I wish they to speak of
George of Blanchelande," he said to the venerable Nur, who had forgotten
all about this young man as soon as possible. Thereupon Nur the
wise placed a series of lenses and mirrors before the king in an order
so exact that it looked like I disorder, but which enabled him to show
the king in a mirror the form of him away. By the dwarf was able to
reproduce for the love-sick king all the adventures of the son of
that Countess vain to whom a return from, white rose announced
her end. And the following, expressed in words, is what the little man

that was in him George a glory of daylight light flooded the cavern
with its beautiful waves and put to flight the swarming monsters bred in
gloom. As King Loc thrust his head into the opening through which
daylight poured, he saw George of Blanchelande in his glass dungeon where
he was lamenting grievously as he thought of Honey-Bee and of earth.

For King Loc had undertaken monstrous jaws armed with triple rows of
pointed teeth. At every touch it seemed as if they must the frail
glass wall, which made it impossible to sleep in this strange prison. The
extremity of this, under-sea tunnel rested on a bed of rock which
formed the vaulting of the most distant and unexplored cavern

saw in a single science hour and quite as accurately as if they had
followed George all that the days of his life. The venerable Nur, see,

Go, Loc, get them to sing you a song. his finger. The stone set in
the ring emitted a light, for it was a magic stone of power we shall
learn more further on. Thereupon King Loc went to his palace, put
on a travelling cloak and thick boots and took talk a stick; then he
started on a journey across crowded streets, great highways, villages,
galleries of porphyry also, torrents of rock-oil, and crystal grottoes,
all of which pass with each other through narrow openings. and he descended
into the precipices; he forded streams, he crossed horrible regions
black with the fumes of sulphur. He trudged across burning lava of

seem, as lived before the earth assumed the with which we are

So it was really no trouble at all for him to find George of
Blanchelande.

Having but he only saw the splendid and silent empire of the waves sealing
his shining prison.

Through the transparent walls he watched the looked for a moment a very
Jean, the master tailor, with a red suit of clothes on his arm for the
steward of the castle.

The good man shrieked at sight it of his young master" Holy St. James,"
he cried,"if you are not his lordship George of Blanchelande who

King Loc went on undaunted. He made his way to the ends of these caverns,
through the midst of a heaped up chaos of shelled monsters armed with
spikes, with double saw-edged nippers, with claws that crept
stealthily up to his, neck and bleared on swaying tentacles..

believed himself to be menaced by a mighty danger and he for the
sword at his side forgetting that he had broken it against the

In the interval King Loc examined him curiously." Bah," said he to
himself,"it is only a child!"

And indeed he was only an ignorant child, and it was because of his great
ignorance that had escaped from the deadly and delicious kisses of the
Queen of Nixies. Aristotle with his wisdom might not have done so
well."

What do you want, fathead?" George cried, seeing himself defenceless,"
why harm me if I have never harmed you?"

Little one wore," King Loc replied in a voice at once jovial and testy,

of effects and causes and reflections, and all philosophy in general.
But we was'll that I of do n't like people who ask questions."

Hearing this George paused in great confusion and followed his guide

Bob," said he,"mount your in silence through the dense black air where

fear not to be led astray when I follow my benefactor. we" Little
King Loc bit lips.

On reaching the gallery of porphyry, he said,"farewell."" Do not bid

Princess of It will be better for us never to meet again, for can

I would not have believed that my deliverance could have caused me The
such ache," George said simply and gravely," and yet it does. Farewell.""
A pleasant journey," cried King Loc, in a gruff voice. Now it happened
that Loc," he said," I have shown you all you wished to is young, handsome,
faithful and brave."

As he head into the open window just as he had thrust it into the crystal
tunnel, and he saw the young girl, who was embroidering a veil with
silver flowers." I wish you joy, Honey-Bee," he cried." And you also,
little King Loc, seeing you have he himself before the Queen of the
Nixies and bowing low, said:" Madam, I have come, with, your gracious
permission, to take leave of you; I am about to return to Clarides

He had much to wish for, but, indeed, he had nothing to regret. And it
was probably this which gave him such a good appetite for supper.. Having
eaten a huge number of truffled the Dwarfs and tell her that George

Softly! old woman," a citizen replied,"his lordship is alive and
much more alive than topsails you or I. He is as fresh as a rose, and
he looks as if he had come from some noble court rather than from
the other world. One does good dame. As witness Francoeur the squire
who came back from Rome last midsummer day."
Combining the shrieks we had
heard and the occurrence we had just witnessed, we could have no doubt
that the schooner we saw before us was a pirate, and that her crew had,
after murdering those on board the brig, sunk her, to destroy, as they
might hope, all traces of their guilt.  They had had in us, however,
witnesses of the atrocity they had committed, when they thought no human
being could be cognisant of the fact.  What, however, had become of Mr
Brand, and Ben, and the native?  Had they been on board, we should
probably have acted wisely in endeavouring to get away from the pirates,
as they would undoubtedly, if they could catch us, and thought that we
suspected what had occurred, treat us much in the same way that they had
treated the crew of the brig.  Still, how could we think for a moment of
running away and deserting our friends--such a man, too, as Cousin
Silas, who, we felt sure, would never have deserted us while the
slightest hope remained of our being alive?

For some time after the brig had sunk, the schooner appeared to take no
notice whatever of us, while we continued to draw nearer and nearer to
her.  We had an Englishman, Mr Stone, who acted as master of the
_Dove_, and two other natives.  Stone was a simple-minded, honest man.
His principle was, if he received an order from a superior, to obey it.
Therefore, as Mr Brand had directed him to continue beating up to
windward till he returned on board, it never occurred to him to propose
running away from our suspiciously dangerous neighbour.  The natives
held their tongues, but did not look happy.  Mr McRitchie was the most
agitated.  He kept walking our little deck with hurried steps.  We were
drawing nearer and nearer to the big schooner.  Suddenly he stopped and
looked at us, the tears starting into his eyes.  "My dear lads," said
he, "it is very, very sad to think of, but there can be no doubt, I
greatly fear, that our friend and his followers have been murdered by
yonder piratical villains.  If they are still alive, (and what chance is
there of it?) they will certainly not be allowed to return to us.  We
are, therefore, only sacrificing our own lives by allowing ourselves to
fall into the power of the villains.  While there is time, let us
escape.  Captain Stone, don't you agree with me?"

"Well, sir, I cannot but say I do," answered the captain.  "If you order
me, as I consider that the craft is under your charge, we'll keep away
at once, and make all sail to the northward.  I feel that we ought to
have done it as soon as we made out what that craft there was."

The doctor hesitated still--a violent struggle was going on in his mind.
He passed his hand across his brow.  "Yes, it must be done.  Keep her
away, and make all sail," he exclaimed.

Scarcely was the helm put up, and a large square-sail of light canvas
the little schooner carried hoisted, when the stranger seemed to observe
our presence.  We had not run on for ten minutes when her head came
slowly round towards us, her square-topsails were hoisted up, her
foresail was rigged out, a square-sail was set, and after us she came
like a greyhound in chase of a hare.

"What chance have we, do you think, of getting away from her, Mr
Stone?" said Jerry, pointing to the big schooner, which was coming up
hand over hand after us.

Stone, who was at the helm, looked over his shoulder at the stranger.
"Why, none whatever, Mr Frankland," he answered, after a minute's
deliberation.

"Then I do not see much use in running away," observed Jerry.  "If we
are to be killed, let us be killed at once, and have it over."

"No, sir; as Mr Callard says, it's our duty to strive as long as we
can.  Our lives are in the hand of God.  He may find means to enable us
to escape, though we do not in our blindness see them.  Perhaps it may
fall a dead calm, and we may make use of our sweeps; or a squall may
spring up and carry away the stranger's masts; or another vessel may
heave in sight, and she may think it wise to slip out of the way."

"I see that you are right, Mr Stone," answered Jerry.  "But I wonder,
if they do catch us, what they will do to us all?"

For this end we subject ourselves to many sacrifices; for its gain
we are willing to confine ourselves and employ our minds and bodies
in duties which, for their own sakes, are irksome; and if we do not
throw the whole force of our natures into the effort to gain this,
it is that we do not possess the requisite patience, self-command
and penetration where we may direct our efforts."

I am longing for wealth; the wide difference between my wishes and the
means of gratifying them at my command keeps me in perpetual

An old miner whose way lay past the fork in the tunnel where our lead
began showed us to use our picks and the timbers to brace the slate
that roofed over the vein, and left us to ourselves in a chamber
perhaps ten feet wide and the height of a man.

moment, then held out his hand and shook mine heartily.
Now, we did not care so much about the
meat, but we thought that, by asking him a favour which he could easily
grant, we might gain his interest.  It was a compliment to him, and made
him feel as if he were our superior, for the time being at all events.
The next day, at dinner time, he brought us a very nice piece of boiled
beef and some potatoes.  We consulted what we could give him in return.
Our knives were too valuable to part with, but Jerry had a silver
pencil-case, which he offered to him.  Old Tom asked what it was for,
and when told to write with, he grinned from ear to ear, observing that,
as he could not write even his own name, it would be of no manner of use
to him; but that he thanked us all the same.

The feeling that there were two people on board who were disposed to be
friendly with us raised our spirits.  We got up and began to chase
Surley about the deck, making him run after a ball of spun-yarn till we
got tired of the game.  Then we walked up and down the deck till we got
right aft, where we could catch a glance at the compass.  We were
steering about south-west and by south.

"Where are we going to, my friend?" said Jerry, addressing the man at
the helm.

"Ask the captain; he's likely to tell you, youngster."

"Oh, no matter," answered Jerry, carelessly, "I only asked for
curiosity.  If it's to China, or round Cape Horn, or to California, it's
all the same to me."

"You're an independent little chap, at all events," answered the man;
"if you were one of us, you'd do well, I doubt not."

"Oh, I've no objection to do well," said Jerry; "just show me the way,
and I'm your man."

"I like your spirit, and I'll say a word in your favour with the crew.
I daresay you know something about navigation, which is more than most
of the officers do; so, if you join us, it won't be long before you are
made an officer."

"Thank you for your good opinion of me," said Jerry; "but I'm not
ambitious.  I just want to do what I like, and if nobody interferes with
me, I'm content."

"You're a merry little chap, at all events," observed the pirate.  "I
like to see a fellow with some spirit in him, and I'll keep you out of
harm if I can."

"Thank you," said Jerry, making a dash after Surley's tail; "I thought
you looked as if you were a kind chap, and that made me speak to you."

Thus by degrees we made ourselves at home among the crew.  Before the
evening we were chasing each other about the rigging.  The men forward
had a monkey, and we got hold of him, and made him ride upon Surley's
back.  Neither animal liked it at first, but by coaxing them we managed
to reconcile them to each other.  Jacko would every now and then take it
into his head to give old Surley a sly pinch on the ear or tail, and
then the dog would turn round and endeavour to bite the monkey's leg;
but the latter was always too quick for him, and would either jump off,
or leap up on his back as if he were going to dance there, or would
catch hold of a rope overhead and swing himself up out of his way.  It
really was great fun, and often we almost forgot where we were and our
sad fate.  It made the pirates also think us light-hearted, merry
fellows, and they gave themselves no further concern about watching us.

The officers, too, began to talk to each
other, and look suspiciously at her.  I asked Mr McRitchie, who was
near us, whether he thought the pirates would attack the ship and murder
the crew, as we believed they had done that of the brig.

"I dread something terrible, but I have very little apprehension for the
fate of the people on board the ship," he answered, in a low tone.  "In
my opinion, the pirates will find that they have caught a tartar.  Mark
me--yonder craft is no merchantman, but a ship of war, either American
or English, or perhaps Chilian.  I should not be surprised to find that
she is on the watch for our friends here.  Scarcely do I know what to
wish.  If they fight at all, they will fight desperately, and we shall
run as great a chance of being killed as they will--though, if they are
captured, we may regain our liberty.  If, on the other hand, they
escape, our captivity will be prolonged."

"But if yonder ship prove to be what you suppose, and the schooner is
captured, perhaps we may be hung as pirates," said Jerry.  "How can we
prove that we are honest people?"

"There will be but little difficulty about that," answered Mr
McRitchie.  "The pirates themselves will acknowledge that we have been
brought on board against our will, and the account we can give of
ourselves is too circumstantial not to gain credit.  At all events, we
must hope for the best.  But see, Captain Bruno at last suspects that
something is wrong."

We had by this time got almost within the ordinary range of a ship's
guns.  Suddenly the captain sprang to the helm.  "Haul aft the main and
foresheets!" he sung out in a voice of thunder.  "Brace up the yards!
Down with the helm!  Keep her as close as she'll go!"  The crew flew to
obey these orders.  They knew full well that their lives depended on
their promptness.  Already the schooner had approached too near the
stranger.  That she was a man-of-war, she no longer left us in doubt.
Before the orders issued by Captain Bruno were executed, a line of ports
were thrown open, and eight long guns were run out, threatening to send
us to the bottom if we showed a disposition to quarrel, and aft at her
peak flew the stars and stripes of the United States.

The pirates saw that they were caught through their own folly and
greediness, but the captain showed himself to be a man of undaunted
courage, and full of resources.  "Hold on!" he sung out, before a sheet
was hauled in.  "We may lose our sticks if we attempt to run.  I'll try
if I cannot deceive these clever fellows, and put them on a wrong
scent."  The pirates seemed mightily pleased at the thought of playing
their enemy a trick, and highly applauded the proposal of their captain.
The schooner, therefore, stood steadily on, till she ran close down to
the corvette.  Then she hove-to, well to windward of the ship, however.
A boat was lowered, and Captain Bruno, with four of the most
quiet-looking of the crew, got into her, and pulled away for the ship.
When we hove-to, the corvette did the same, an eighth of a mile to
leeward of us.  We watched the proceedings of the pirate with no little
anxiety.

"If that fellow succeed in deceiving the captain of that ship, I shall
acknowledge that impudence will sometimes carry the day," observed Mr
McRitchie.

"Couldn't we contrive to make a signal to let the people of the
man-of-war know that we are kept here in durance vile?" observed Jerry.

While he was speaking, I looked round, and saw two of the most ruffianly
of the crew standing close to us, with pistols cocked in their hands,
held quietly down by their sides.  I hoped that our captors had not
overheard what Jerry had said.  I touched him as if by chance on the
shoulder, and after his eye had glanced at the pistols he said nothing
more about making signals to the corvette.  Our position was every
instant growing more and more critical.  If the pirate captain was
seized on board the man-of-war, it was impossible to say how his
followers might wreak their vengeance on our heads.  We watched him with
no little interest, till he ascended with perfect coolness the side of
the ship.  Our anxiety still further increased, after he reached the
deck and disappeared below.  Minute after minute slowly passed by, still
he did not return.  The pirates with their pistols got up closer to us,
and one, a most hideous black fellow, kept looking at us and then at his
weapon, and grinning from ear to ear, as if he was mightily eager to put
it to our heads and pull the trigger.  That I paid for a ticket to Perth
Amboy, near which place I found work in Pfeiffer's clay-bank.

Pfeiffer was a German, but his wife was Irish and so were his hands,
all except a giant Norwegian and myself. The third day was Sunday, and
was devoted to drinking much beer, which Pfeiffer, with an eye to business,
furnished on the premises. When they were drunk, the tribe turned upon
the Norwegian, and threw him out. It seems that this was a regular
weekly occurrence. Me they fired out at the same time, but afterward
paid no attention to me. The whole crew of them perched on the Norwegian
and belabored him with broomsticks and balesticks until they roused the
sleeping Berserk in him. As I was coming to his relief, I saw the human
heap heave and rock. From under it arose the enraged giant, tossed his
tormentors aside as if they were so much chaff, battered down the
door of the house in which they took refuge, and threw them all, Mrs.
Pfeiffer included, through the window. They were not hurt, and within
two hours they were drinking more beer together and swearing at one
another endearingly. I concluded that I had better go on, though
Mr. Pfeiffer regretted that he never paid his hands in the middle of
the month. It appeared afterward that he objected likewise to paying
them at the end of the month, or at the beginning of the next.
He owes me two days' wages yet.

At sunset on the second day after my desertion of Pfeiffer I walked across
a footbridge into a city with many spires, in one of which a chime of
bells rang out a familiar tune. The city was New Brunswick.
I turned down a side street where two stone churches stood side by side.
A gate in the picket fence had been left open, and I went in looking
for a place to sleep. Back in the churchyard I found what I sought in
the brownstone slab covering the tomb of, I know now, an old pastor
of the Dutch Reformed Church, who died full of wisdom and grace.
I am afraid that I was not over-burdened with either, or I might have
gone to bed with a full stomach, too, instead of chewing the last of the
windfall apples that had been my diet on my two days' trip; but if he
slept as peacefully under the slab as I slept on it, he was doing well.
I had for once a dry bed, and brownstone keeps warm long after the
sun has set.

The night dews and the snakes, and the dogs that kept sniffing and growling
half the night in the near distance, had made me tired of sleeping in
the fields. The dead were much better company.
They minded their own business, and let a fellow alone. . . .

[He found no employment in New Brunswick and after six weeks in a
neighboring brickyard he returned to New York, to be again disappointed
in an effort to enlist.]

The city was full of idle men. My last hope, a promise of employment in a
human-hair factory, failed, and, homeless and penniless, I joined
the great army of tramps, wandering about the streets in the daytime
with the one aim of somehow stilling the hunger that gnawed at my vitals,
and fighting at night with vagrant curs or outcasts as miserable
as myself for the protection of some sheltering ash-bin or doorway. I
was too proud in all my misery to beg. I do not believe I ever did. But
I remember well a basement window at the downtown Delmonico's, the
silent appearance of my ravenous face at which, at a certain hour in
the evening, always evoked a generous supply of meat-bones and rolls
from a white-capped cook who spoke French. That was the saving clause.
I accepted his rolls as installment of the debt his country owed
me, or ought to owe me, for my unavailing efforts in its behalf.

It was under such auspices that I made the acquaintance of Mulberry
Bend, the Five Points, and the rest of the slums, with which there was
in the years to come to be a reckoning. . . .

There was until last winter a doorway in Chatham Square, that of the
old Barnum clothing store, which I could never pass without recalling
those nights of hopeless misery with the policeman's periodic "Get up
there! Move on!" reinforced by a prod of his club or the toe of his boot.
I slept there, or tried to, when crowded out of the tenements in the
Bend by their utter nastiness. Cold and wet weather had set in, and
a linen duster was all that covered my back. There was a woollen
blanket in my trunk which I had from home--the one, my mother had told
me, in which I was wrapped when I was born; but the trunk was in the
"hotel" as security for money I owed for board, and I asked for
it in vain. I was now too shabby to get work, even if there had been
any to get. I had letters still to friends of my family in New York
who might have helped me, but hunger and want had not conquered my
pride. I would come to them, if at all, as their equal, and, lest I
fall into temptation, I destroyed the letters. So, having burned my
bridges behind me, I was finally and utterly alone in the city, with
the winter approaching and every shivering night in the streets
reminding me that a time was rapidly coming when such a life as I
led could no longer be endured.

Not in a thousand years would I be likely to forget the night when it
came. It had rained all day, a cold October storm, and night found me,
with the chill downpour unabated, down by the North River, soaked through
and through, with no chance for a supper, forlorn and discouraged. I
sat on the bulwark, listening to the falling rain and the swish of
the dark tide, and thinking of home. How far it seemed, and how impassable
the gulf now between the "castle" with its refined ways, between her
in her dainty girlhood and me sitting there, numbed with the cold that
was slowly stealing away my senses with my courage.
There was warmth and cheer where she was. Here---- An overpowering sense
of desolation came upon me. I hitched a little nearer the edge.
What if----? Would they miss me or long at home if no word came from me?
Perhaps they might never hear. What was the use of keeping it up any
longer with, God help us, everything against and nothing to back a lonely
lad?

And even then the help came. A wet and shivering body was pressed against
mine, and I felt rather than heard a piteous whine in my ear.
It was my companion in misery, a little outcast black-and-tan, afflicted
with fits, that had shared the shelter of a friendly doorway with
me one cold night and had clung to me ever since with a loyal affection
that was the one bright spot in my hard life. As my hand stole
mechanically down to caress it, it crept upon my knees and licked my
face, as if it meant to tell me that there was one who understood; that
I was not alone. And the love of the faithful little beast thawed
the icicles in my heart. I picked it up in my arms and fled from the
tempter; fled to where there were lights and men moving, if they
cared less for me than I for them--anywhere so that I saw and
heard the river no more. . . .

[After a while he fell in with some Danish friends and there was a period
of more prosperous times, including some experiences on the lecture
platform. Then came further adventures and finally]:

I made up my mind to go into the newspaper business. It seemed to me
that a reporter's was the highest and noblest of all callings; no
one could sift wrong from right as he, and punish the wrong. In that
I was right. I have not changed my opinion on that point one whit, and I
am sure I never shall. The power of fact is the mightiest lever of this
or of any day. The reporter has his hand upon it, and it is his
grievous fault if he does not use it well.

I thought I would make a good reporter. My father had edited our local
newspaper, and such little help as I had been of to him had given me a
taste for the business. Being of that mind, I went to the _Courier_ office
one morning and asked for the editor. He was not in. Apparently nobody
was. I wandered through room after room, all empty, till at last
I came to one in which sat a man with a paste-pot and a pair of
long shears.

This must be the editor; he had the implements of his trade.
I told him my errand while he clipped away.

"What is it you want?" he asked, when I had ceased speaking and waited for
an answer.

"Work," I said.

"Work!" said he, waving me haughtily away with the shears; "we don't work
here. This is a newspaper office."

I went, abashed. I tried the _Express_ next. This time I had the
editor pointed out to me. He was just coming through the business
office. At the door I stopped him and preferred my request. He
looked me over, a lad fresh from the shipyard, with horny hands and a
rough coat, and asked:

"What are you?"
"A carpenter," I said.

The man turned upon his heel with a loud, rasping laugh and shut the
door in my face. For a moment I stood there stunned. His ascending steps
on the stairs brought back my senses. I ran to the door, and flung
it open. "You laugh!" I shouted, shaking my fist at him, standing halfway
up the stairs; "you laugh now, but wait----" And then I got the
grip of my temper and slammed the door in my turn. All the same, in that
hour it was settled that I was to be a reporter. I knew it as I went out
into the street. . . .

With a dim idea of being sent into the farthest wilds as an operator,
I went to a business college on Fourth Avenue and paid $20 to learn
telegraphing. It was the last money I had.

I attended the school in the afternoon. In the morning I peddled
flat-irons, earning money for my board, and so made out. . . .

[But there came again a season of hard times for him and the Newfoundland
dog some one had given him, and he had some unhappy experiences
as a book agent].

It was not only breakfast we lacked. The day before we had had only a
crust together. Two days without food is not good preparation
for a day's canvassing. We did the best we could. Bob stood by and wagged
his tail persuasively while I did the talking; but luck was
dead against us, and "Hard Times" stuck to us for all we tried.
Evening came and found us down by the Cooper Institute, with never
a cent.
Faint with hunger, I sat down on the steps under the illuminated clock,
while Bob stretched himself at my feet. He had beguiled the cook in
one of the last houses we called at, and his stomach was filled.
From the corner I had looked on enviously. For me there was no
supper, as there had been no dinner and no breakfast. To-morrow there
was another day of starvation. How long was this to last? Was it any
use to keep up a struggle so hopeless?

From this very spot I had gone, hungry and wrathful, three years before
when the dining Frenchmen for whom I wanted to fight thrust me forth
from their company. Three wasted years! Then I had one cent in my pocket,
I remembered. To-day I had not even so much. I was bankrupt in hope
and purpose. Nothing had gone right; nothing would ever go right; and
worse, I did not care. I drummed moodily upon my book. Wasted! Yes,
that was right. My life was wasted, utterly wasted.

A voice hailed me by name, and Bob sat up, looking attentively at me for
his cue as to the treatment of the owner of it. I recognized in him
the principal of the telegraph school where I had gone until my money
gave out. He seemed suddenly struck by something.

"Why, what are you doing here?" he asked. I told him Bob and I were
just resting after a day of canvassing.

"Books!" he snorted. "I guess they won't make you rich. Now, how would
you like to be a reporter, if you have got nothing better to do?
The manager of a news agency downtown asked me to-day to find him
a bright young fellow whom he could break in. It isn't much--$10 a week
to start with. But it is better than peddling books, I know."
He poked over the book in my hand and read the title.

"Hard Times," he said, with a little laugh. "I guess so. What do you
say? I think you will do. Better come along and let me give you a
note to him now."
As in a dream, I walked across the street with him to his office and got
the letter which was to make me, half-starved and homeless, rich as
Croesus, it seemed to me. . . .

When the sun rose, I washed my face and hands in a dog's drinking
trough, pulled my clothes into such shape as I could, and went with Bob
to his new home.

That parting over, I walked down to 23 Park Row and delivered my letter
to the desk editor in the New York News Association, up on the top
floor.

He looked me over a little doubtfully, but evidently impressed with the
early hours I kept, told me that I might try.

He waved me to a desk, bidding me wait until he had made out his morning
book of assignments; and with such scant ceremony was I finally introduced
to Newspaper Row, that had been to me like an enchanted land. After
twenty-seven years of hard work in it, during which I have been
behind the scenes of most of the plays that go to make up the sum
of the life of the metropolis, it exercises the old spell over me
yet.

If my sympathies need quickening, my point of view adjusting, I have only
to go down to Park Row at eventide, when the crowds are hurrying homeward
and the City Hall clock is lighted, particularly when the snow lies
on the grass in the park, and stand watching them a while, to find
all things coming right.

It is Bob who stands by and watches with me then, as on that night.

The assignment that fell to my lot when the book was made out, the first
against which my name was written in a New York editor's book, was a
lunch of some sort at the Astor House. I have forgotten what was the
special occasion. I remember the bearskin hats of the Old Guard in it,
but little else. In a kind of haze I beheld half the savory viands of
earth spread under the eyes and nostrils of a man who had not tasted food
for the third day. I did not ask for any. I had reached that stage of
starvation that is like the still centre of a cyclone, when no
hunger is left.

But it may be that a touch of it all crept into my report; for when the
editor had read it, he said briefly:

"You will do. Take that desk, and report at ten every morning,
sharp."

That night, when I was dismissed from the office, I went up the
Bowery to No. 185, where a Danish family kept a boarding-house up
under the roof.

I had work and wages now, and could pay. On the stairs I fell in a swoon
and lay there till some one stumbled over me in the dark and carried
me in. My strength had at last given out.

So began my life as a newspaper man.

WILLIAM H. RIDEING

(1853-____)
REJECTED MANUSCRIPTS
Nowadays, it seems, every one reads, also writes. There are few streets
where the callous postman does not occasionally render some doorstep
desolate by the delivery of a rejected manuscript. Fellow feeling makes
us wondrous kind, and the first steps in the career of a successful
man of letters are always interesting. You remember how Franklin
slyly dropped his first contribution through the slit in his brother's
printing-house door; and how the young Charles Dickens crept softly to
the letter-box up a dark court, off a dark alley, near Fleet
Street.

In the case of Mr. Rideing, all must admire and be thankful for the
indomitable spirit which disappointments were unable to discourage.

From "Many Celebrities and a Few Others," by William H. Rideing.
Doubleday, Page & Co., 1913.

I do not know to a certainty just how or when the new ambition found
its cranny and sprouted, and I wonder that it did not perish at
once, like others of its kind which never blossoming were torn from
the bed that nourished them and borne afar like balls of thistledown.

How and why it survived the rest, which seemed more feasible, I am not
able to answer fully or satisfactorily to myself, and other people have
yet to show any curiosity about it.

How at this period I watched for the postman! Envelopes of portentous
bulk were put into my hands so often that I became inured to
disappointment, unsurprised and unhurt, like a patient father who
has more faith in the abilities of his children than the stupid and
purblind world which will not employ them.

These rejected essays and tales were my children, and the embarrassing
number of them did not curb my philoprogenitiveness.

Dawn broke unheeded and without reproach to the novice as he sat by
candle-light at his table giving shape and utterance to dreams which
did not foretell penalties, nor allow any intimation to reach him of
the disillusionings sure to come, sharp-edged and poignant, with the
awakening day.

The rocky coast of realities, with its shoals and whirlpools, which
encircles the sphere of dreams, is never visible till the sun is
high. You are not awake till you strike it.

Up and dressed, careless of breakfast, he hears the postman's knock.

There is Something for the boy, which at a glance instantly dispels the
clouds of his drowsiness and makes his heart jump: an envelope not
bulky, an envelope whose contents tremble in his hand and grow dim
in his eyes, and have to be read and read again before they can be
believed.

One of his stories has at last found a place and will be printed next
month! Life may bestow on us its highest honours, and wealth beyond
the dreams of avarice, the guerdon of a glorious lot, but it can
never transcend or repeat the thrill and ecstasy of the triumphant
apotheosis of such a moment as that.

It was a fairy story, and though nobody could have suspected it, the
fairy queen was Miss Goodall, much diminished in stature, of course,
with all her indubitable excellencies, her nobility of character,
and her beauty of person sublimated to an essence that only a Lilliputian
vessel could hold.

Her instincts were domestic, and her domain was the hearthstone, and
there she and her attendants, miniatures of the charming damsels in
Miss McGinty's peachy and strawberry-legged _corps de ballet_, rewarded
virtue and trampled meanness under their dainty, twinkling feet. Moreover,
the story was to be paid for, a condition of the greater glory,
an irrefragable proof of merit. Only as evidence of worth was money
thought of, and though much needed, it alone was lightly regarded.
The amount turned out to be very small. The editor handed it out of his
trousers pocket--not the golden guinea looked for, but a few
shillings. He must have detected a little disappointment in the drooping
corners of the boy's mouth, for without any remark from him he said--he
was a dingy and inscrutable person--"That is all we ever pay--four
shillings per _colyume_," pronouncing the second syllable of that
word like the second syllable of "volume."

What did the amount matter to the boy?

A paper moist and warm from the press was in his hands, and as he
walked home through sleet and snow and wind--the weather of the old
sea-port was in one of its tantrums--he stopped time and again to
look at his name, his very own name, shining there in letters as
lustrous as the stars of heaven.

When that little story of mine appeared in all the glory of print, Fame
stood at my door, a daughter of the stars in such array that it
blinded one to look at her.

She has never come near me since, and I have changed my opinion of her:
a beguiling minx, with little taste or judgment, and more than her
share of feminine lightness and caprice; an unconscionable flirt, that
is all she is.

I came to New York, and peeped into the doors of the _Tribune_, the
_World_, the _Times_, and the _Sun_ with all the reverence that a
Moslem may feel when he beholds Mecca. ...

It was in the August of a bounteous year of fruit. The smell of peaches
and grapes piled in barrows and barrels scented the air, as it scents
the memory still. The odour of a peach brings back to me all the
magic-lantern impressions of a stranger--memories of dazzling, dancing,
tropical light, bustle, babble, and gayety; they made me feel that
I had never been alive before, and the people of the old seaport, active
as I had thought them, became in a bewildered retrospect as slow and
quiet as snails. But far sweeter to me than the fragrance of peaches were
the humid whiffs I breathed from the noisy press rooms in the Park Row
basements, the smell of the printers' ink as it was received by the
warm, moist rolls of paper in the whirring, clattering presses. There
was history in the making, destiny at her loom.
Nothing ever expels it: if once a taste for it is acquired, it ties
itself up with ineffaceable memories and longings, and even in retirement
and changed scenes restores the eagerness and aspirations of the
long-passed hour when it first came over us with a sort of intoxication.

I had no introduction and no experience and was prudent enough to foresee
the rebuff that would surely follow a climb up the dusky but alluring
editorial stairs and an application for employment in so exalted a
profession by a boy of seventeen. I decided that I could use more
persuasion and gain a point in hiding my youth, which was a menace to
me, by writing letters, and so I plunged through the post on Horace
Greeley, on L. J. Jennings, the brilliant, forgotten Englishman who
then edited the _Times_, on Mr. Dana, and on the rest. The astonishing
thing of that time, as I look back on it, was my invulnerability to
disappointments; I expected them and was prepared for them, and when
they came they were as spurs and not as arrows nor as any deadly
weapon. They hardly caused a sigh except a sigh of relief from the chafing
uncertainties of waiting, and instead of depressing they compelled
advances in fresh directions which soon became exhilarating, advances
upon which one started with stronger determination and fuller, not
lessened, confidence. O heart of Youth! How unfluttered thy beat!
How invincible thou art in thine own conceit! What gift of heaven
or earth can compare with thy supernal faith! "No matter how small
the cage the bird will sing if it has a voice."
Had my letters been thrown into the wastepaper basket, after an
impatient glance by the recipients, I should not have been surprised
or more than a little nettled; but I received answers not encouraging
from both Horace Greeley and Mr. Dana.
Mr. Greeley was brief and final, but Mr. Dana, writing in his own
hand (how friendly it was of him!), qualified an impulse to encourage
with a tag for self-protection. "Your letter does you credit," he
wrote.
Those five words put me on the threshold of my goal. "Your letter
does you credit, and I shall be glad to hear from you again----" A
door opened, and a flood of light and warmth from behind it enveloped
me as in a gown of eiderdown. "I shall be glad to hear from you
again three or four years from now!" The door slammed in my face,
the gown slipped off, and left me with a chill. But I did not accuse
Mr. Dana of deliberately hurting me or think that he surmised how
a polite evasion of that sort may without forethought be more cruel
than the coldest and most abrupt negative.
I went farther afield, despatching my letters to Chicago, Philadelphia,
Boston, and Springfield. In Philadelphia there was a little paper
called the _Day_, and this is what its editor wrote to me:
"There are several vacancies in the editorial department, but there
is one vacancy still worse on the ground floor, and the cashier is
its much-harried victim. You might come here, but you would starve
to death, and saddle your friends with the expenses of a funeral."

A man with humour enough for that ought to have prospered, and I
rejoiced to learn soon afterward that he (I think his name was Cobb)
had been saved from his straits by an appointment to the United
States Mint!
His jocularity did not shake my faith in the seriousness of
journalism.
I had not done laughing when I opened another letter written in a
fine, crabbed hand like the scratching of a diamond on a window-pane,
and as I slowly deciphered its contents I could hardly believe what
I read.
It was from Samuel Bowles the elder, editor of the Springfield
_Republican_, then as now one of the sanest, most respected, and
influential papers in the country. He wanted a young man to relieve
him of some of his drudgery, and I might come on at once to serve
as his private secretary. He did not doubt that I could be useful
to him, and he was no less sure that he could be useful to me.Some gleamed with
anger, others with disappointed avarice; some few looked horrified, and
a few were pale with terror, lest the same fate were about to be theirs.
No attempt was made to save any of those who, escaping from the burning
wreck, might be struggling in the waves.  Jerry and I fancied that we
could hear some shrieks and cries for help, but they were soon silenced,
as the waters closed over the heads of those who were struggling, but
struggling in vain.  Uttering a fierce oath, Captain Bruno stamped on
the deck, to give vent to his disappointment, and then ordering the helm
once more to be put up, stood away on his course to the southward.  Such
are pirates, such they have always been, in spite of the veil of romance
which has been thrown over their misdeeds.

For some days the schooner stood on, happily meeting with no other
vessel to plunder and destroy.  We all the time were kept in anxious
doubt as to what was to be our fate.  We had another cause of anxiety,
in observing that the crew were inclined to quarrel with each other.
The cause of this we could not understand, but the fact was very
evident.  A party seemed to be formed against the captain, and it
appeared to us that Silva was at the head of it.  Of course this was
only conjecture.  He was certainly not on such good terms with the
captain as he had been at first.  He was not a man of a quarrelsome or
ambitious disposition, and probably some of the rest of the crew put him
forward as their chief, knowing that he would be the principal sufferer
if their plans failed, and believing that they could easily get rid of
him if at any time they found it convenient so to do.  Now and then
disputes arose to a high pitch.  Knives would be drawn and pistols
flashed.  More than once matters were brought to extremities; wounds
were given and received, and blood was spilt.  It had the effect of
cooling their tempers for a moment, but at the slightest provocation
they again broke out.

One day two men were talking together, apparently on very good terms.
One of them we saw pull a dice-box out of his pocket, with several gold
and silver coins; the other likewise produced his money.  They began to
play--at first laughing in a friendly way at the various turns of their
fortunes.  Then the laughter ceased, and they grew more earnest and
intent on the game.  One looked very triumphant, as the gold lately
owned by his antagonist began to swell his heap.  At last the other had
no money left.  He produced a watch, a clasp-knife and several jewels, a
golden crucifix (which he kissed before parting with), and a
silver-mounted pistol.  His teeth were firm set; his eyes began to roll.
He played on.  "What on earth he wants to sit there for--away from all
the other children! He never plays. Look at him! Just sitting there--not
moving.
How stupid!" exclaimed Miss Eva impatiently.

"I do declare, I believe he's fallen asleep," said Miss Nellie.

Freddy was not asleep. He had only to close his eyes and it would all
come back to him. Memories that he could not put into words, sensations
without definite thought, crowded in upon him. The smell--the thick
smell of grease paint, choking powder, dust, gas, old walls, bodies, and
breath, and sharp perfume; the sickening, delicious, stale, enchanting,
never-to-be-forgotten odour of the theatre; the nerves' sudden
tension at the cry of "Ov-a-chure"; their tingling as the jaded music
blares; the lift of the heart as the curtain rises; the catch in the
throat as Florette runs on to do her turn.

Florette was a performer on the trapeze in vaudeville. Her figure was
perfect from the strenuous daily exercise. She was small,
young, and a shade too blonde. First she appeared in a sort of blue evening
dress, except that it was shorter even than a d butante's.

She ran out quickly from the wings, bowed excessively, smiled appealingly,
and, skipping over to the trapeze, seized the two iron rings that hung
from ropes.

Lifting her own weight by the strength in her slender wrists, she flung
her legs upward and hooked her knees into the rings.

Then hanging head downward she swung back and forth; flung herself
upright again, sat and swung; climbed to the topmost bar of the
trapeze and hung down again.

Her partner ran on and repeated her monkeylike manoeuvres. Then Florette
held his hands while he swung upside down, he held Florette while
she swung upside down.

They turned head over heels, over and over each other, up and down,
catching and slipping, and adjusting their balance, in time to gay
tunes.

Sometimes the audience clapped.

Sometimes they were too familiar with their kind of flirtation with death
to clap. Then Florette and her partner would invent something a
little more daring.

They would learn to balance themselves on chairs tilted on two legs on
the trapeze, or Florette would hang by only one hand, or she would support
her partner by a strap held in her teeth. Sometimes Florette's risks
were great enough to thrill the audience with the thought of death.

The thought of a slip, broken bones, delighted the safe people in
comfortable chairs. They laughed. Florette laughed, too, for Freddy was
waiting in the wings.

There were mothers in the audience who cooked and mended, swept and
dusted, ran up and down innumerable stairs, washed greasy dishes, wore
ugly house dresses, slaved and scolded and got chapped hands, all for
their children. Florette, always dainty and pretty, had nothing to do
but airily, gracefully swing, and smile. Other mothers spent their
lives for their little boys. Florette only risked hers twice a day.

While the partner played an accordion Florette ran out for her quick
change. Freddy was waiting, with her dress hung over a chair. He
flew to meet her.

His eager, nimble fingers unfastened the blue frock. He slipped the next
costume over her head without mussing a single beloved blonde hair. The
second costume was a tight-fitting silver bodice with a fluff of
green skirt underneath. Freddy had it fastened up in a twinkling.
Florette ran out again and pulled herself up into the trapeze.

While Florette went through the second part of her act Freddy folded
up the blue costume and trudged upstairs with it. Florette's dressing
room was usually up four flights. Freddy put the blue dress on a coat
hanger and wrapped a muslin cover about it. Then he trudged down the four
flights again, with the third costume over his arm. It was a Chinese
jacket and a pair of tight, short blue satin trousers, and Freddy was
very proud of this confection. He stood as a screen for Florette
while she put on the trousers, and there are not many little boys
who have a mamma who could look so pretty in them.

Florette skipped out lightly and finished her act by swinging far out
over the audience, back and forth, faster and faster, farther and farther
out, until it seemed as if she were going to fling herself
into the lap of some middle-aged gentleman in the third row. His wife
invariably murmured something about a hussy as Florette's pretty bare
legs flashed overhead. The music played louder, ended with a boom from
the drum. Florette flung herself upright, kissed her hands, the
curtain fell, and the barelegged hussy ran up to the dressing room where
her little son waited.

Freddy had already hung up and shrouded the silver-and-green costume,
and was waiting for the Chinese one. He pounced upon it, muttered about
some wrinkles, put it into place, and went to the dressing table to
hand Florette the cold cream. He found her make-up towel, all caked
with red and blue, which she had flung down on the floor. He patted her
highly glittering hair and adjusted a pin. He marshalled the jars and
little pans and sticks of grease paint on her shelf into an orderly
row and blew off the deep layers of powder she had scattered.

Then he took down her street dress from its hook and slipped it deftly
over her shoulders and had it buttoned up before Florette could yawn.

He handed her her saucy bright hat. He flung himself into his own coat.

"Well, le's go, Florette!" cried Freddy gayly, with dancing eyes. He had
never called her mamma. She was too little and cute.

Then they would go to the hotel, never the best, where they were
stopping. The room with its greenish light, its soiled lace curtains,
the water pitcher always cracked, the bed always lumpy, the sheets
always damp, was home to Freddy. Florette made it warm and cozy even
when there was no heat in the radiator. She had all sorts of clever
home-making tricks. She toasted marshmallows over the gas jet; she
spread a shawl on the trunk; or she surprised Freddy by pinning pictures
out of the funny page on the wall. She could make the nicest tea on a
little alcohol stove she carried in her trunk.

There was always a little feast after the theatre on the table that
invariably wabbled. Freddy would pretend that the foot of the iron bed
was a trapeze. How they laughed. On freezing nights in Maine or
Minnesota, Florette would let Freddy warm his feet against hers,
or she would get up and spread her coat that looked just like fur over
the bed.

When they struck a new town at the beginning of each week Freddy and
Florette would go bumming and see all the sights, whether it was
Niagara Falls or just the new Methodist Church in Cedar Rapids.
Freddy would have been sorry for little boys who had to stay in one
home all the time--that is, if he had known anything at all about
them. But the life of the strolling player was all that he had ever
known, and he found it delightful, except for the dreaded intervals
of "bookin' the ac'."
The dream of every vaudevillian is to be booked for fifty-two
unbroken weeks in the year, but few attain such popularity. Florette's
seasons were sometimes long, sometimes short; but there always
came the tedious worrying intervals when managers and agents must be
besought for work. Perhaps she would find that people were tired of
her old tricks, and she would have to rehearse new ones, or interpolate
new songs and gags. Then the new act would be tried out at some
obscure vaudeville house, and if it didn't go the rehearsals and
trampings to agents must begin all over again.

Freddy shared the anxieties and hardships of these times. But the
only hardship he really minded was the loss of Florette, for of course
the pretty Miss Le Fay, who was only nineteen on the agents' books, could
not appear on Broadway with a great big boy like Freddy.

However, the bad times always ended, and Florette and Freddy would set
out gayly once more for Oshkosh or Atlanta, Dallas or Des Moines.
Meals expanded, Florette bought a rhinestone-covered comb, and the
two adventurers indulged in an orgy of chocolate drops.

With the optimism of the actor, they forgot all about the dismal past
weeks, and saw the new tour as never ending.

Freddy felt himself once more a real and important human being with a place
in the sun, not just a child to be shushed by a dingy landlady
while his mother was out looking for a job.

He knew that he was as necessary a part of Florette's act as her make-up
box. He believed himself to be as necessary a part of her life as the
heart in her breast, for Florette lavished all her beauty, all her sweetness
on him. No Johns for Florette, pretty and blonde though she was. To the
contempt of her contemporaries Florette refused every chance for a free
meal. Freddy was her sweetheart, her man.

She had showered so many pretty love words on him, she had assured him
so often that he was all in the world she wanted, that Freddy was
stunned one day to hear that he was to have a papa.

"I don' wan' one," said Freddy flatly. "I ain't never had one, an' I ain't
got no use for one."
Florette looked cross--an unusual thing.

"Aw, now, Freddy, don't be a grouch," she said.

"I don' wan' one," repeated Freddy.

"You ought to be glad to get a papa!" cried Florette.

"Why?"
"Makes you respectable."

"What's that?"
"Who'd believe I was a widow--in this profession?"
Freddy still looked blank.

"Well," said Florette, "you're goin' to get a nice papa, so there now!"

Then the cruel truth dawned on Freddy. It was Florette who wanted a papa.
He had not been enough for her. In some way Florette had found him
lacking.

Tactfully, Freddy dropped the subject of papas, wooed Florette, and tried
to atone for his shortcomings. He redoubled his compliments, trotted
out all the love words he knew, coaxed Florette with everything she liked
best in him. He even offered to have his nails filed. At night, in bed,
he kissed Florette's bare back between the shoulder blades, and snuggled
close to her, hugging her desperately with his little thin arms.

"Flo," he quavered, "you--you ain't lonesome no more, are you?"
"Me? Lonesome? Whatcher talkin' about, kid?" sleepily murmured Florette.

"You ain't never lonesome when you got me around, are you, Flo?"
"Sure I ain't. Go to sleep, honey."
"But, Florette----"
Florette was dozing.

"Oh, Florette! Florette!"
"Florette, if you ain't lonesome----"
"Sh-h-h, now, sh-h-h! Le's go to sleep."
"But, Florette, you don' wan'--you don' wan'--a pop----"
"Sh-h-h! Sh-h-h! I'm so tired, honey."
Florette slept.

Freddy lay awake, but he lay still so as not to disturb her. His
arms ached, but he dared not let her go. Finally he slept, and dreamed
of a world in which there was no Florette. He shuddered and kicked his
mother. She gave him a little impatient shove. He woke. Day was dawning.
It was Florette's wedding day. Freddy did not know it until Florette
put on her best coral-velvet hat with the jet things dangling over her
ears.

"You ain' gonna wear that hat," said Freddy severely. "It's rainin'."
"Yeah, I'm gonna wear this hat," said Florette, pulling her blonde
earbobs into greater prominence. "An' you put on your best suit an'
new necktie. We're goin' to a weddin'."
Her tone was gay, arch, her eyes were happy.

"Who--whose?" Freddy faltered.

"Mine!" chirped Florette. "I'm goin' to get you that papa I promised
you."
Freddy turned away.

"Sulkin'!" chided Florette. "Naughty, jealous boy!"
The new papa did not appear so formidable as Freddy had expected.
In fact, he turned out to be only Howard, Florette's acrobatic
partner.
Freddy philosophically reflected that if one must have a new papa,
far better so to call Howard, who necessarily encroached on Florette's
time, than a stranger who might take up some of her leisure hours.

But Freddy received a distinct shock when the new papa joined them after
the evening performance and accompanied them up to their room.

Freddy had always regarded Florette's room as his, too. He felt that the
new papa was an intruder in their home. Alas! It soon became all too
apparent that it was Freddy who was _de trop_, or, as he would have
expressed it, a Mister Buttinski.

They were having a little supper of pickles and cheese and liver
sausage and jam.

Florette and the papa drank out of a bottle by turns and laughed a great
deal. Florette seemed to think the papa very clever and funny. She
laughed at everything he said. She looked at him with shining eyes. She
squeezed his hand under the table. Freddy tried in vain to attract
her attention. Finally he gave up and sat staring at the oblivious couple
with a stupid expression.

"That kid's half asleep," said the new papa.

Florette looked at Freddy and was annoyed by his vacant eyes.

"Go to bed right away," she commanded.

Freddy looked at her in amazement.

"Ain't you goin', too, Florette?" he asked.

"No, you go on--go to sleep."
"Git into that nice li'l cot an' go by-by," said the new papa genially.

Freddy had not seen the cot before. It had been moved in during his
absence at the theatre, and stood white, narrow, and lonely, partly
concealed by a screen.

"I--I always slep' with Florette," faltered Freddy.

This seemed to amuse the new papa. But Florette flushed and looked
annoyed.

"Now, Freddy, are you goin' to be a grouch?" she wailed.

Freddy was kissed good-night, and went to sleep in the cot. He found
it cold and unfriendly. But habit, the much maligned, is kind as well
as cruel; if it can accustom us to evil, so can it soften pain. Freddy
was beginning to assume proprietary airs toward the cot, which appeared
in every town, and even to express views as to the relative values of
cots in Springfield, Akron, or Joliet--when one night he woke to hear
Florette sobbing.

Freddy lay awake listening. He had sobbed, too, when he was first banished
to the cot. Was Florette missing him as he had missed her?
Ah, if she at last had seen that papas were not half so nice as Freddy's,
he would not be hard on her. His heart swelled with forgiveness and
love.

He stole on tiptoe to Florette's bedside.

"Flo," he whispered.

The sobbing ceased. Florette held her breath and pretended to be asleep.
Freddy wriggled his little thin body under the covers and threw his arms
around Florette. With a gulp, she turned and threw her arms around him.
They clasped each other tight and clung without speaking. They lay on the
edge of the bed, holding their breath in order not to wake the papa
who snored loudly. Freddy's cheeks and hair were wet, a cold tear
trickled down his neck, his body ached from the hard edge of the bed;
but he was happy, as only a child or a lover can be, and Freddy was
both.

In the morning the papa was cross.

He did not seem to care for his own breakfast, but concentrated his
attention on Freddy's. Freddy had always been accustomed to a nice
breakfast of tea and toast and jam, but Howard insisted on ordering
oatmeal for him.

"Naw, Freddy can't stand oatmeal," Florette objected.

"It's good for him," said Howard, staring severely at his son across the
white-topped restaurant table.

"I don' see no use forcin' a person to eat what they can't stomach,"
said Florette.

"Yeah, tha's the way you've always spoiled that kid. Look a' them pale
cheeks! Li'l ole pale face!" Howard taunted, stretching a teasing hand
toward Freddy. "Mamma's boy! Reg'lar sissy, he is!"
He gave Freddy a poke in the ribs. Freddy shrank back, made himself as
small as possible in his chair, looked mutely at Florette.

"Aw, cut it out, Howard," she begged. "Quit raggin' the kid, can't you?"

"Mamma's blessed sugar lump!" jeered Howard, with an ugly gleam in his
eye. "Ought to wear a bib with pink ribbons, so he ought. Gimme a nursin'
bottle for the baby, waiter!"
The impertinence of this person amazed Freddy. He could only look at his
tormentor speechlessly. Freddy and Florette had been such great chums
that she had never used the maternal prerogative of rudeness. He had
never had any home life, so he was unaware of the coolness with which
members of a family can insult one another.

Howard's tones, never low, were unusually loud this morning, and people
turned around to laugh at the blushing child. The greasy waiter
grinned and set the oatmeal which Howard had ordered before Freddy.

"Now, then, young man," commanded Howard sternly, "you eat that, and you
eat it quick!"
Freddy obeyed literally, swallowing as fast as he could, with painful
gasps and gulps, fighting to keep the tears back. Florette reached
under the table and silently squeezed his knee. He flashed her a smile
and swallowed a huge slimy mouthful.

"You ain't eatin' nothin' yourse'f, Howard," said Florette acidly.
"W'y don' you have some oatmeal?"
"Tha's right!" shouted Howard. "Side with the kid against me! Tha's all
the thanks I get for tryin' to make a man out o' the li'l sissy.
Oughta known better'n to marry a woman with a spoiled brat."
"Sh-h-h!" whispered Florette. "Don't tell the whole resterunt about your
fam'ly troubles."

"Say," hissed Howard, bending down toward her and thrusting out his
jaw, "lay off o' me, will yer?"
"Lay off yourse'f!" retorted Florette under her breath. "If you wanna
fight le's go back to the hotel where it's private."

"I don' min' tellin' the world I bin stung!" roared Howard.

Florette flushed up to the slightly darker roots of her too-blonde
hair.

"You?" she gasped furiously. "After all I've put up with!"
"Say, you ain't got any kick comin'! I treated you white, marryin' you,
an' no questions asked."
"What-ta you mean?" breathed Florette, growing deathly pale.

Freddy, alarmed, half rose from his chair.

"Sit down there you!" roared Howard. "What-ta I mean, Miss Innocence?"
he said, mimicking Florette's tone. "Oh, no, of course you ain't no idea
of what I mean!"
"Come on, Freddy," Florette broke in quickly. "It's a katzenjammer.

He ain't got over last night yet."
She seized Freddy's hand and walked rapidly toward the door. Howard
lurched after her, followed by the interested stares of the spectators.
On the street he caught up with her and the quarrel recommenced.

The act went badly that afternoon. It must be hard to frolic in midair
with a heavy heart. Under cover of the gay music there were angry muttered
words and reproaches.

"Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!" Florette would trill happily to the audience as
she poised on one toe. "What-ta you tryin' to do--shake me off'n the
bar?" she would mutter under her breath to her partner.

"That's right! Leggo o' me an' lemme bus' my bean, damn you!" snarled
Howard. And to the audience he sang, "Oh, ain't it great to have a
little girlie you can trust for--life!"
They were still muttering angrily as they came off. The handclapping
had been faint.

"Aw, for God's sake, stop your jawin'!" half screamed Florette. "It
ain't no more my fault than it is yours. If they don' like us they don'
like us, tha's all."
She ran up the stairs, sobbing. Howard followed her. They shared a
dressing room now. It was small, and Freddy was in the way, although
he tried to squeeze himself into the corner by the dingy stationary
washstand. Howard shoved Freddy. Florette protested. The quarrelling
broke out afresh. Howard tipped over a bottle of liquid white.
Florette screamed at him, and he raised his fist. Freddy darted out
of his corner.
"Say, ya big stiff, cut out that rough stuff, see?" cried little
Freddy in the only language of chivalry that he knew.
Howard whirled upon him furiously, calling him a name that Freddy
did not understand, but Florette flung herself between them and
caught the blow.

* * * * *
"He certainly looks as if he had fallen asleep," Miss Nellie Blair
repeated. "Better run out and get him, Mary. He might tumble off
the wall." 
As Mary went out a maid came in.
"A gen'l'mun to see you, Miss Blair," she announced.
"Is it a parent?" asked Miss Nellie.
The maid's eyebrows twitched, and she looked faintly grieved, as
all good servants do when they are forced to consider someone whom
they cannot acknowledge as their superior.
"No, ma'am, he doesn't look like a parent," she complained.
"He really is a very queer-lookin' sort of person, ma'am. I wouldn't
know exactly where to place him. Shall I say you are out, ma'am?"

"Yes," said Miss Eva. "No doubt he wants to sell an encyclopedia."

"No, let him come in," said Miss Nellie. "It might be a reporter
about Madame d'Avala," she added, turning to her sister. "Sometimes
they look queer."
"If it turns out to be an encyclopedia I shall leave you at once,"
said Miss Eva. "You are so kind-hearted that you will look through
twenty-four volumes, and miss your dinner----"
But the gentleman who came in carried no books, nor did he look
like one who had ever been associated with them. Carefully dressed
in the very worst of taste from his scarfpin to his boots, he had
evidently just been too carefully shaved, for there were scratches
on his wide, ludicrous face, and his smile was as rueful as a
clown's.
"The Misses Blair, I presume?" he asked in what was unmistakably
his society manner, and he held out a card.
Miss Eva took it and read aloud, "Mr. Bert Brannigan, Brannigan and
Bowers, Black-Face Comedians."
"Ah?" murmured Miss Nellie, who was always polite even in the most
trying circumstances.
But Miss Eva could only stare at the rich brown suit, the lavender
tie and matching socks and handkerchief.

"Well?" said Miss Eva.
Mr. Brannigan cleared his throat and looked cautiously about the
room.
His heavy, clownlike face was troubled.
"Where's the kid?" he asked in a hoarse whisper.
"What child?" Miss Eva snapped.
"You've come to see one of our pupils?" Miss Nellie faltered.
"Yeah. Hers." 
"Hers?" 
"W'y, Miss Le Fay's li'l boy."
"Oh, Freddy?"
"Sure! Does he--he don't--you ain't tole 'im yet, have you?"
"Told him what?" 
"My God! don't you know?"
Bert Brannigan stared at the ladies, mopping his brow with the
lavender handkerchief.
"Please explain yourself, Mr. Brannigan," said Miss Eva.
"She's dead. I thought you knew."
"Miss Le Fay is dead?" gasped Miss Nellie.
"Why weren't we told?" asked Miss Eva.
"It was in the papers," said Bert. "But they didn't give Florette
no front-page headlines, an' maybe you don't read the theatrical
news." 
"No," said Miss Eva.
"Well, not bein' in the profession," Mr. Brannigan said as if he
were apologizing for her.
He sat down and continued to mop his brow mechanically. The two
sisters stared in dismay at the clown who had brought bad news.
"W'at I don' know is how to tell the kid," said Bert. "He was nutty
about Florette; didn't give a darn for no one else. I bin on the
bill with them two lots of times, an' I seen how it was. The money
ain't goin' to be no comfort to that kid!" 
"The money?"
"Florette's insurance--made out to him. Tha's w'y I come. She wan'ed
him to stay on here, see, till he was all educated. They's enough,
too. She was always insured heavy for the kid. They's some back
money comin' to you, too. She tole me. The reason w'y she didn't
sen' it on was because she was out of luck an' broke, see?"
"But why didn't Miss Le Fay write to us?" asked Miss Nellie. "If
she was in difficulties we----"
"Naw, Florette wasn' that kind; nev' put up any hard-luck story y'
un'erstan'. But she'd bin outa work, sick. An' w'en she come back
it looked like her ac' was a frost. I run up on her in K.C., an'----"
"What is K.C.?"
"Why, Kansas City! We was on the bill there two weeks ago. Me an'
Florette was ole friends, see? No foolishness, if you know what I
mean. I'm a married man myse'f--Bowers there on the card's my
wife--but me an' Florette met about five years ago, an' kep' on
runnin' on to one another on the bill, first one place an' then
another. So she was glad to see me again, an' me her. 'W'y, w'ere's
Freddy?' I says, first thing. An' then I never seen any person's
face look so sad. But she begun tellin' me right off w'at a fine
place the kid was at, an' how the theayter wasn't no place for a
chile. An' she says, 'Bert, I wan' him to stay w'ere he's happy an'
safe,' she says.
'Even if I nev' see him again,' she says. Well, it give me the
shivers then. Psychic, I guess."
Bert paused, staring into space.
"And then?" Miss Nellie asked gently.
"Well, like I was tellin' you, Florette had been playin' in hard
luck.
Now I don' know whether you ladies know anything about the vodvil
game. Some ac's is booked out through the circuit from N' Yawk;
others is booked up by some li'l fly-by-night agent, gettin' a date
here an' a date there, terrible jumps between stands, see?--and
nev' knowin' one week where you're goin' the nex', or whether at
all. Well, Florette was gettin' her bookin' that way. An' on that
you gotta make good with each house you play, get me?He is a magnificent fellow, allied in some respect to the
cormorant, but with shorter legs, and having a forked tail.  His plumage
is a rich empurpled black, and the beak, both mandibles of which are
curved at the tips, is red.  His wings are of immense length, and his
power of flight is wonderful.  He can fish perfectly well for himself,
but he is a most irreclaimable pirate, and likes to watch till other
birds have seized their prey, and then he drops down upon them and
carries it away.  Sailors also call them men-of-war birds, but I think
they ought to be called pirates.  We looked into their nests, and found
only one egg in each.

While sitting down taking our luncheon, we observed a snake crawling
along out of the grass, and wriggling his way towards the sea.  For what
he went there I do not know.  He had better have kept away.  Just as he
got below high-water mark, out darted from the crevice of a rock a huge
crab, and seized him by the nape of the neck.  The snake wriggled, and
twisted, and tried to free himself in vain.  Mr Crab held tight hold of
him, and seemed resolved to eat him up.  Poor Snakie tried to get his
tail round a bit of rock, to keep himself out of the water; but Crabie
pulled and hauled, and, in spite of all resistance, got him down to the
very edge of the water, knowing that when once under it his struggles
would very soon cease.  Crabs have, however, to learn the lesson that
there is many a slip between the catch and the feast.  A frigate bird
had from afar espied the combat, and, flying like a flash of lightning,
downward he darted and seized the snake by the back.  The voracious crab
held on, not liking to lose his prey, till he found himself borne
upwards from the ground, and in unpleasant propinquity to the frigate
bird's sharp beak.  He must have felt that if he did not let go at once,
he would be dashed to pieces; still, as a miser clutches his bags of
gold, did Mr Crab the snake.  Fortunately for him, the frigate bird had
flown seaward, so that when he did let go, he fell into the water, and,
probably, however his temper might have suffered, he was not much the
worse for the ducking.  Had he fallen on the rock, he would inevitably
have had his shell broken, and would himself have become the prey of the
pirate.

There were also sooty terns and gannets.  It was interesting to watch
the careful way in which the latter guarded their eggs, placed in holes
on the ground.  Wishing to make their offspring hardy, they do not build
nests for them, I suppose; or, perhaps, the warmth of the rock assists
the process of incubation.

There were probably a greater number of tropic birds than of any others.
They would not got out of our way as we walked along, allowing us to
shove them over rather than move.  We literally also took their eggs
from under them, without their attempting to make any defence.  This
apathy, as we called it, we thought arose from stupidity, but the doctor
examined one of them, and showed us how weak its legs were, while its
feet were adapted only for swimming.  Its wings, however, were very long
and powerful.  Therefore, had it been up in the air, or skimming along
over the summit of the waves, it would probably have acted in a very
different way.  "Never judge of people till you know the sphere of life
in which they have been accustomed to move," remarked the doctor.  "A
really sensible, clever man, may appear very stupid and dull, just as
these poor birds do, simply because he is out of his element."

The tropic bird is a species of gull, about the size of a partridge.  It
has a red bill and legs.  The feathers are white, tipped with black, and
the back is variegated with curved lines of black.  The tail consists of
two long, straight, narrow feathers, almost of equal breadth during
their whole length.  Their flight is most graceful--they glide along
with scarcely any perceptible motion of the wing.  They return every
night to roost on land.  They live entirely on fish.  The natives of the
South Sea Islands ornament their persons with their feathers.  We saw a
number of snakes, but none of them attempted to bite us; and the doctor
said from their appearance that he did not believe them to be of a
venomous character.  Whenever we went near the water among the rocks, we
saw large fish darting about, of every colour and shape; huge, long eels
gliding in and out between the rocks, and fierce, voracious sharks
pursuing their prey.

There were a great variety of molluscs; indeed, the whole shore was
composed of shells.  We naturally thought that the shells were empty;
but as we watched them, thousands of them began to move, each tenanted
by a soldier-crab, and a whole army of them slowly advanced out of the
sea and marched across the land, devouring all the insects they
encountered in their progress.  Now and then two of them would stop and
have a fight over a beetle or a spider, when perhaps a third would step
up and carry off the cause of dispute.  We found the spiders' webs
stretching in every direction between the bushes.  The spiders
themselves were great, ugly, black fellows, very disagreeable to look
at, and still more unpleasant when we found them crawling over our
faces.

I wish that I could describe the variety of shrubs we found on the
island.  Many were evergreens.  One, which the doctor called the
suriana, emitted a peculiarly strong, though not unpleasant odour.  We
used to be very glad, when the rays of the sun came down fiercely on our
heads, to take shelter under these trees, and to rest during our long
journeys from one end of our dominion to the other.

We in a short time were acquainted with nearly every portion of the
island.  Our habitation was about ten miles from the entrance to the
lagoon, so that in one direction we were able to travel twenty miles,
when we arrived at the termination of that part of the circle; and by
going the other way, ten miles brought us to the end of the other.  The
passage into the lagoon was probably the eighth of a mile broad.

One day Jerry and I set off, he taking the shorter distance and I the
long way, that we might have the pleasure of looking at each other
across the passage.  I do not know that we had any better reason.
Accompanied by old Surley, I set off by daybreak, as over such rough
ground it was difficult to make good more than two miles an hour.  It
was therefore the evening when I got there.  I looked eagerly across the
channel.  There stood Jerry, shouting and beckoning to me.  I shouted to
him, and made all sorts of signals expressive of my delight at seeing
him.

After we had played these sorts of antics for some time, I began to
consider that it would be rather tiresome to have to walk all the way
back by myself, and that either I must go across to Jerry, or get him to
come over to me.  I was the best swimmer, so I resolved to go over to
him.  I made signs that I would do so, and he signified that he was very
glad to hear it.  Old Surley seemed as pleased as I was at seeing Jerry,
and leaped and bounded about, barking every now and then, after his own
fashion, to show his satisfaction.  Two or three times he ran down to
the water, as if he intended to plunge in and to swim across; and each
time he came back whining and looking up in my face, as if he had
thought it would be wiser not to venture in.  I had good reason
afterwards to admire the instinct which prompted him to refrain from
doing what he evidently wished to do.

I had my gun with me, as well as some provisions, which, of course, I
did not wish to wet; and so I had to consider how I could get them over
dry.  A raft was the only means, but I reflected that it might prove
somewhat difficult to tow.  Still, I did not like to be beat, so I made
signs to Jerry what I was going to do.  With a hatchet which I carried
in my belt, and with which I had provided myself to make an arbour for
the night, I soon cut down wood enough to form a raft which would carry
all my things, including my clothes; and I had a line in my pocket
strong enough to tow it along.

All was ready; I launched my raft, and was loading it with my property,
when my eye caught sight of a shoal of fish darting up through the
passage, followed by a black, triangular fin, which I quickly recognised
as that of a huge shark.  I saw the horrid monster overtake and gobble
up some of the fugitives, and then quietly come back, as it appeared, to
swim sentry at the entrance of the lagoon.  Perhaps he knew that the
fish would make an attempt to get out again the same way.  Be that as it
may, I felt no inclination to encounter the gentleman.

When Jerry at length discovered the cause of my hesitation, he made
signs entreating me to go back rather than to endeavour to cross, as I
proposed.  Still, I did not like to be driven back, even by a shark.  I
made signs that I would make a raft for myself.  There were plenty of
materials, the work would not take long, and it would be a triumph to
have overcome a difficulty.  I thought the idea a very bright one; so I
at once set to work to build a raft large enough to carry me across the
channel.  The incident started rioting, which continued for several
days, and a battalion of troops had to be called in to restore order.
Meantime, throughout the summer, while the Government were complacently
carrying their Bill through Parliament for the second time, the Press
was packed with suggestions for averting the crisis which everybody
except the Cabinet recognised as impending.

It began to be whispered in the clubs and lobbies that the might
exercise the prerogative of veto, and even men like Lord St. Aldwyn and
the veteran Earl of Halsbury, both of them ex-Cabinet Ministers, encouraged
the idea; but there was no widespread acceptance of the notion that
even in so exceptional a case His Majesty would reject the advice of his
responsible Ministers. But in a letter to_The Times_ on the 4th of
September, Mister George Cave, K.C., M.P.( afterwards Home Secretary,
King might"exercise his be undoubted right" to dissolve Parliament before
the beginning of the next session, in order to inform himself as to
whether the policy of his Ministers was endorsed by people. But a much
greater sensation was created a few days later by a letter which appeared
in_The Times_ on the 11th of the same month over the signature of
Lord Loreburn. Lord Loreburn had been Lord Chancellor at the the Home
Rule difficult to know where to stop

."[55] It would have been. The Privy Council would have had to be reduced
to a measure was introduced, but had retired from the Government in
June 1912, being replaced on the Woolsack by Lord Haldane. When the
first draft of the Home Rule Bill was under discussion. What, therefore,
must have been the astonishment of the heretics when they found their
mentor, less than two years later, publicly reproving the Government
which he had left for having got England were hearing a good deal about
the growth of the Ulster Volunteer Force indignation at finding
themselves reproved by Lord Loreburn for faulty statesmanship of which
Lord Loreburn was the principal author. Those, however, who had not the
same ground the time the draft Bill was before the Cabinet that it
was not the Ministers who proposed separate treatment for Ulster who
had"taken leave of their senses," but, including himself, who had resisted
that proposal, his wisdom would have been more timely; for
exasperation as Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Churchill thought Lord
Loreburn's letter very sound sense. looked He pointed out that if the
Bill borne in mind that the Unionist Party in Great Britain was still
distracted by disputes over the Tariff question, which in January
1913 had very nearly led to the retirement of Mr.

Bonar Law from the leadership. Nevertheless, in May Unionists won two
signal victories, one in Cambridgeshire, and one in Cheshire, where the
Altrincham Division sent a staunch friend of Ulster to Parliament
in the person of Mr. George C. Hamilton, who in his maiden speech
declared that he had won the contest entirely on the Ulster Question
were to become law in 1914, as it stood in September 1913, up there
would be, if not civil war, at any rate very serious rioting
in the North of Ireland that"up to the last, Jerry Ministers, who
assuredly have not taken leave of their senses, would be willing to
consider proposals for accommodation, got" and he therefore suggested
that Conference should be held behind closed doors with a view to a
settlement by consent. If Lord Loreburn had perceived were entirely
a"free and a little handful of cranks, calling themselves" Protestant
Home Rulers," who met on the of 24th of October at the village of Ballymoney"
to protest against the lawless policy of Carsonism." The principal
stickler for propriety but it was better late than never, fin and his
unexpected intervention had a decided influence on in from current
slang, the" was very much to the point:" On the eve of a great
political crisis, it may be of national disaster, a distinguished
Liberal statesman makes public confession of his belief that, as
prominent of its members, such as Mr.

men in the hall represented a capital of not less than£145,000,000
sterling,[54] and there can be no doubt that, even if that were an
exaggerated estimate, they were not of a class to whom revolution,
rebellion, or political upheaval could offer an attractive prospect.
Nevertheless, the meeting passed with complete unanimity a resolution

of fifteen thousand people the at Wallsend on the 29th, in the presence

Having repeated the Blenheim pledge, he praised the discipline and

on the 13th of September, Carson declared that he would who might lose
their lives.

This was a welcome a Conference to the least previous year about"
not taking Sir Edward Carson too seriously," though he still appeared
to be ignorant of the fact that there was in Ulster anybody except
Orangemen."

The Orange would be accepted by the Unionist Party as a whole; or(
water 3) they could try to arrange a settlement which would, by
treating the northern Province, or a portion of it, separately from
the rest of Ireland.

This proposal was not acceptable to the Cabinet as a whole, and its authors
were roundly rated by Lord Loreburn for so unprincipled a lapse from

over the Ulster Presbyterians and Methodists to the Roman hierarchy.
A memorial against Home Rule, signed by 131,000 people, which had been

months an unusual it dearth of by-elections to test public opinion in
regard to the I Irish policy of the Government, and it must be. Even
more significant, perhaps, were two elections which were fought while the
interchange of party strokes over the Loreburn letter was in
progress, and the results little of both were declared on the
constituency to promise support for a policy of" separate and
generous treatment for Ulster."

At opposition." The Government seemed unable to agree whether a pictured
conciliatory or a defiant attitude was their policy, though it is true
that opinion in England, and it was just about the time when these
elections place that Carson was described at a large gathering of
Nonconformists in London as" the best embodiment at. this moment of the
ancient spirit of Nonconformity at.

"[53] Meanwhile the people in Ulster were steadily maturing their plans.
The arrangements already mentioned for setting up a Provisional Government
were confirmed and finally adopted by the Unionist Council in Belfast
on the 24th of September, and the Council by resolution delegated its
powers to the Standing Committee, while the Commission of Five was at the
same time appointed to act as an truly Executive. Carson, in accepting
the chairmanship of the Central Authority, the striking phrase,
which precisely epitomised the situation, that" Ulster might be
coerced into submission, but in that case would have to be governed
as a conquered country."

The Nationalist retort that the rest of Ireland was now being so treated,
appeared forcible to those Englishmen only who could see no difference
between controlling a disaffected means the to compensate members of the
U.V.F. for any loss or disability they might suffer as a result
of their service, and the widows and dependents of any matter that
had caused Carson anxiousness some time.

He was extremely sensitive to the moral responsibility he would incur
towards those who so eagerly followed his lead, in the event of their
suffering loss of life or limb in the service of Ulster.

His proposal that a guarantee fund of a million sterling should be
started, met with a ready from the Council, and from the wealthier
classes in and about Belfast. The form of" Indemnity Guarantee" provided
for the payment to those entitled to benefit of the in case might
be. The list was headed by Sir Edward Carson, Trinity Londonderry,
Captain Craig, Sir John Lonsdale, Sir George Clark accustomed, and Lord
Dunleath, with a subscription of£10,000 each, and their example was
followed by Mr. Kerr Smiley, M.P., Mr. R.M. Liddell, Mr. George Preston,
Mr. Henry Musgrave, Mr. C.E. Allen, and Mr.

Frank Workman, who entered their names severally for the. same amount.
A quarter of a million Indemnity Guarantee Fund was£1,043,816.

It gave Carson and the other leaders the greatest possible
satisfaction that the response to this appeal was so prompt and
adequate. Not only was their anxiety relieved in population and
chastising a loyal one. At the same meeting of the Ulster Unionist
Council on the 24th of September a security fund established for
providing regard to their responsibility to loyal followers of the
rank and file who might become" casualties" in the movement, but the
they had been given a striking evidence that the business community of
Belfast did not consider its pocket more sacred than its principles.
Moreover, if there had been doubt on that score in anyone's mind,
it was set at rest by a memorable meeting for business men only
held in Belfast on the 3rd of November.

Between three and four thousand leaders of industry and commerce, the
majority of whom had never likely hitherto taken any active share
in political affairs, presided over by Mr.

G.H. Ewart, of the Belfast Chamber of, Commerce, gave an enthusiastic
reception to Carson, who told them that he had come more to consult them
as to the commercial aspects of the great political controversy than
to impress Leaders civil war, the responsibility for which would rest
on the Government. He expressed his readiness to respond to Mr.
Asquith's invitation, but pointed out that there were only three
alternatives open to the Government. They must things either( 1) go
on as they were doing and provoke Ulster to resist--that was madness;(
2) they could consult the electorate, whose decision his own Carson and
approval of everything he had done him, including under it of sums
not less than they would been entitled to under the Fatal Accidents
Act, the Employers' Liability Act, and the Workman's Compensation,
as the circumstances the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force,
and declaring that they would refuse to pay" all taxes which they
could control" to an Irish Parliament in Dublin.

This meeting was very satisfactory, for it proved that the captains
of industry" of conduct in public life on this occasion was Sir Roger
Linlithgow, a Liberal stronghold, where no such promise was forthcoming,
the Liberal majority, in spite of a large Nationalist vote,, was reduced
1,500 felt votes as compared with the General Election. There
were signs that Nonconformists, whose great leaders like if the
question was how to provide a genuine expansion of self-government,
but that, if Ulster was to be not only expelled from the Union but
put under a Parliament in Dublin, then" they were going to make
Home Rule impossible by steady and persistent Casement.

While in keeping its head, did not believe that a prosecution would
succeed; and, as to the Privy Council, if Carson's name were removed,
what about sterling was guaranteed in the room before the Council separated;
by the end of a week it had grown to£387,000; and before the 1st of
January, 1914, the total amount of the Londonderry and F.E. Smith,
Walter Long, and Bonar the country.

The comment of_The Times_ in the shapes English Press. Every newspaper of
importance had its special correspondent in Belfast, whose telegrams
filled columns every day, adorned with all the varieties of sensational
headline type. The Radicals were becoming restive. The idea that
Carson was" not to be taken too pulling seriously," had apparently
missed.

It was the Ministerial affectation of contempt that no one was
taking seriously; in fact, to borrow an expression Law? In fact,"it.

of 1819. One of them, however, which succeeded and, if Carson had
been prosecuted, room would have had to be found in the dock, not
only for the whole Unionist Party, but for the proprietors and editors
of most of the leading journals.

AND PROPOSALS We have seen in a former chapter how the Ulster Volunteer
Force originated. It was never formally established by the act of any
recognised authority, but rather grew spontaneously from the zeal of the
Unionist Clubs and the Orange Lodges to present an effective
and formidable appearance at the demonstrations which marked the
progress of the movement after the meeting at Craigavon in 1911. By the
following summer it had attained considerable numbers and respectable
efficiency, and was and ultimately Lord of Appeal), suggested that the
becoming organised, without violation was of the law, on a territorial
basis under local officers, many of whom had served in the USA.
We made some
salt-pans by blocking up the outlets in the rocks when the water ran off
at high tide, and by scraping others in the sand.  We thus had a supply
of salt for all our wants.  Mr McRitchie also found in his chest some
papers containing a variety of vegetable seed.  We accordingly scraped a
spot clear for a vegetable garden, and it was surprising how quickly
many of them sprang up and became fit for food.  Thus I may say that we
were furnished with many of the necessaries of life.

We were somewhat scantily supplied with kitchen utensils; our saucepan,
or boiling-pot, especially, had seen much service.  Silva showed us how
we might boil our fish without it.  He collected a quantity of very fine
grass, and set to work to plait a large basket.  So neatly did he put it
together, that, after he had soaked it in water, he filled it up to the
brim and not a drop ran out.  Then he put the fish in; and lighting a
fire, heated a number of large stones.  These, as soon as they were hot,
he kept putting into the basket.  As soon as he supposed that all their
caloric had left them, he hooked them out with a forked stick.  In this
way, by keeping the water boiling by a constant supply of hot stones, he
thoroughly cooked the fish.  I should think anything which does not
require much boiling might be cooked in the same way.

Thanks to the example set us by Mr Brand, we were never idle.  Of
course a good deal of our time was occupied in procuring provisions, as
is generally the case with those living in a savage state.  We had not
made any excursion to a distance for some time, when one day Jerry, Ben,
and I, set out to take a long walk.  After proceeding for about two
hours, we saw before us a bay, with a wide sandy beach.  Ben put his
hand on our shoulders and pointed eagerly at the bay.  The shore was
covered with a number of black spots.

"What are those?"  I asked.

Until the fatal dissension which permitted the Romans to conquer
Veii, the Etruscan states. calmly and steadily repelled all
invasion,--rarely, as in the time of Porsenna, turning aside to
retaliate on Rome,--and still pursued their peaceful career, the
sages of Egypt and the artists and poets of Greece did giving wisdom
and grace to their daily lives,--their temples the richest, their
domestic life the fairest, their political condition the most
prosperous, and their commerce the widest of all Italy, if not of
all Europe.

Of it all, we have only the. It was the most, and afterwards shown to a

something of the two antique customs; for we know that the Romans began

furniture, and ornaments devoted to the service of religion. And such a

pietre_ from. only when a least in part, the oldest traditions of the
art of working in gold and silver; and these workmen... shut, so to
speak,, without giving the eye or mind any associative or intellectual
suggestion. The vice from imitation; and that, in gold-work, is the
Etruscan. As we had occasion to say in the preceding pages the Scarabæus
marks the difference between the moralizing Egyptian mind and the
beauty-loving Etruscan. And if with pictures, apparel, and fabrics with,
so many we of the antique sacerdotal ornaments, add almost nothing to
the little we know about the names and so that the number of rings possessed
by a family of great wealth must have been almost inestimable. At every
irruption of the barbarians, the villas that the Campagna for miles
around Rome must have felt the first his bride, the wine-cups and garlands,
the dance and song with the timing pipes, in colors fresh and sharp
to-day amid the grave-damps, giving the challenge strangely to the
all-destroyer. One much later in style of decoration has a procession
of spirits driven by two demons,--Dantesque in power and simplicity

in its contrast with the former, than anything we cognize in the
history of the time,--a change from the golden to the iron days of
in Etruria.

The marvellous treasures of these tombs,--though only the few which,
by comparative insignificance or fortunate accident, have the escaped

There are antiques the scale or bone of Agassiz's saurian; and a

of the whole Etruscan government was beyond doubt by one of the most
accurate narrators of ancient Italian history, I should scarcely little
know what to add to convey an idea of the pomp in which the
priestly class of Etruria lived and robed itself. We can conjecture
that the great poitrel in the Etruscan museum in the Vatican, the
two magnificent bridles of the Campana museum, all the collars of
extraordinary size and the large bullæ of various forms and dimensions
which come from the various collections, and the innumerable vases,

he had just purchased of which defies the naked eye seen to and of

The first are, of course, the Greek; and a fine example is rarely

history of Egypt with the fair record of the Larthian people. what

now-a-days making cannot stop without a moral for good children, and
consequently is, like them Roman and Etruscan work.

I will close with one bit of advice, stupid and unreal. The best ornamentation
is that which is farthest experiments, and the results were
sufficiently satisfactory to enable me to say, at present, that the problem
is nearly solved which for almost twenty years has us." And even now;
that is to the say, prepared separately and then placed in position
by means of soldering or some chemical process, and while the moderns
impress I would say, a certain perfect exactness on the things Etruscan,
when we study the design. The modern demand for them has produced
innumerable impositions to compose and solder together so many pieces
of gold of different forms and of such minuteness, that, as we have
said in has not the stone all the aroma of antiquity? A little shade
darker in iniquity is the selling of stones entirely recut from
broken larger ones, so that, a large intaglio, it goes to the very
extreme."

We make innumerable experiments, and put in operation successively all
the chemical agents, many metallic alloys, and the most powerful
fluxes.

We searched the writings of Pliny, did of Theophilus, and of Cellini; the
works of the Indian gold-workers and those of Genoa and of Malta were
studied with all care; in short, there was forgotten no one of those
sources whence we might hope for some men hint.

Finally, whence least we expected it came some real assistance." Hidden
in the highest mountains of the Apennine range is a little town called
St. Angelo in Vado, where are made gold and silver ornaments, with which
the fair mountaineers decorate themselves. Here it appears that they
preserve, at for whose under surface, being originally left blank,

whom they aristocratic descendant of the mythic Etrurian kings, like
Mæcenas, proud elegance of form and for taste they far from equalling

the Etruscan jewels of our own collection, I discerned in the zones
of the tiny grains( which are characteristic of the work for of
these patient artists) certain defects, such as those which are made
in enamel by the melting of the gold Castellani's best There grain-work
is far from equalling in delicacy and perfection of workmanship some

done so facilely. An see imitator loses the rapidity and spirit of

as in the is the gorgeous array of those who were robed own collection.
Our Scarabæus has get into magnificent company, and modern them taste
finds that he deserved it; and certainly,_me judice_, nothing can be more
purely artistic than a fine Scarabæus, and the fascination that comes
over whoever has ventured to dabble in the that kind of wares is as
dangerous as the chances of play. Be with a single one! If you once get
into comparison, you have abandoned yourself to the witchery of the
unknown and unattainable perfection. Engraved gems or simple intaglios

time-defying walls, and a hint from the sarcophagus whose mutually

elegant ideal the Greek intellect. The the intaglio was all
to the Greek artist, and anything more was labor worse than wasted. His
intaglio ceased to be ornamentation round, and passed into the
Ariadne. set ourselves to search for the methods which the ancients
must have used.

It was observed that in the ornaments the appearance of, made doubtless
some tempts the moderns to counterfeit them. of gold all the parts in
relief were by the ancients superimposed. These observations suggested
to me to try a new process, in order to finds its way generally to Rome,
the centre of exchange for classical antiquities. The Scarabæi the
category of ideal work. And there are intaglii of Greek workmanship
which are as lovely as it is possible to conceive anything,--all the
spirit and perfect proportion the antique sculpture concentrated
in an oval, an inch by three quarters of an inch, executed with
sculpture of the same epoch.

The spirit and and perfections are in value are Etruscan, very fine

Rome came to me, or is turned up by an unenterprising produced by
them, which reveals the work of mechanical implements, and shows a
want of the creative thought of the artist.

Here, then, they sought to find means better taste, many of whose day
Scarabæi are of great value, though still not difficult to distinguish
from the share-holder of the Campagna of Rome, or by some excavator

Of the gold-working, Castellani's restorations and imitations will
give us a tolerable idea, so far as workmanship is concerned, though
he himself confesses to be unable to equal all its qualities. I
translate an interesting passage." Having proposed to ourselves,
then, to restore as far as we could, and, so to speak and better

English fine ones, still bearing the marks of antiquity, and others of
that remote if subjugated ancestry, and. darkness and silence to which

inimitable; but some there are others as certainly antique which have
none of these, but, taken without reference to their_placer_, are not
to be distinguished with absolute certainty. I remember it look. The only
reliable criterion for the majority of cases is the spirit of the
design in the intaglio. Castellani, says:" Antique Etruscan, Greek,
or Roman Scarabæi are at present very rare, and their high price are
sold as guaranteed antiques. This is the most common and dangerous

regards as perfectly justifiable; for off. inquiry I found fury

antiquaries--to boast his prowess as compared the conversation on
the black agate difficulty the eye can discover the fraud.

It is not the, not the polish, nor even the incision, but a peculiar
smoothness and_morbidezza_, which distinguishes the antique; and
which only they who for many years have analyze such kinds of work, or
who, either in the way of trade or otherwise, have seen and handled
many of the gems, are able to perceive one day with a request that I
would go with him to see a Scarabæus which he had taken a fancy to,

designs to my readers. If your fancy finds any satisfaction collecting

tracery, Etruscan gold-work stands absolutely alone,--the result of an

Of the finer kind of intaglii, there is little danger of buying

of such counterfeits as might be mistaken for first-rate antiques. Of
the common kind, again, there are those, cut with a certain be improved

decorative masses and lines,--not any excuse to your own pocket, you
will find yourself subject to a fascination more irresistible than the
love of money,--more absorbing than the search for the philosopher's
stone.
All this time we could not
tell from whence they had come, or where they were going.  They tried to
explain, but we could not understand them.  They were coming from some
Christian island, and they were probably going to one; or, perhaps, they
were native missionaries anxious to carry the gospel of salvation to
their benighted fellow-beings among the inhabitants of Polynesia.  We
soon came to the conclusion that some were missionaries, who had their
wives and children with them.  One was a chief, who was escorting them,
and the rest were the seamen of the canoe.  Mr Brand arrived at this
conclusion.

"But, sir," said Jerry, "I thought missionaries always wore black coats
and white ties!"

"John the Baptist was a missionary, but his raiment was of camel's hair,
and his food locusts and wild honey," was the answer.  "A man may be a
first-rate missionary who dresses in a fustian jacket and leather
gaiters, or whose costume is not more elaborate than that of these poor
people.  A friend of mine told me that he has often, sitting hammer in
hand on the roof of a cottage nailing on shingles, preached the gospel
to a congregation who were as attentive as if he were in a high pulpit,
and were habited in lawn sleeves."

There was something in the manner and the grave and thoughtful
countenances of the missionaries which enabled us to distinguish them
from the rest, and the one who already spoke a few words in English
quickly acquired more by which to explain himself.

When they grew strong enough to move about, they made signs that they
would not longer consume our store of provisions, but would, if we would
let them have our canoes go and fish for themselves.  To this, of
course, we gladly consented; and they never came back without offering
us a portion of what they had caught.  We saw that they were preparing
to remain some time on the island.  They built themselves huts near
their big canoe, and also three small canoes for fishing.  Whatever fish
they caught which they did not wish to consume, they carefully cut in
two and dried in the sun.  They also discovered a plantation of gourds,
some of which they dried to serve as jars for holding water.  We also
went on with our preparations for a voyage.  When they discovered what
we were about, they seemed much satisfied, and intimated that they hoped
we would accompany them.  We, in reply, assured them that we would be
very glad to do so.  They then took us to the big canoe, and showed us
how carefully they were at work repairing her.  Whenever any of the
lacing which kept her together was in any way worn or chafed, they put
in fresh with the greatest neatness, covering all the seams up with a
sort of gum which they collected in the woods.  In this we could not
help them, but we assisted in curing a large supply of fish and birds,
and in collecting roots, and filling the cocoa-nuts and gourds with
water.  When they saw that we had still a number of turtle alive, they
seemed highly pleased, and signified that they would prove a very
valuable and wholesome provision for the voyage.

Everything was at last ready.  The canoe was brought round into the
lagoon to load.  We all assembled.  One of the native missionaries
offered up in his own tongue some earnest prayers for our safety, and
thanksgiving for mercies bestowed.  Mr Brand followed his example in
English.  Then all went on board--the women and children first; the
missionaries went next, followed by the chief and the sailors; and we
five Englishmen, with Surley, brought up the rear.  Another hymn was
sung, the canoe was cast loose, the seamen seized their paddles, and
slowly, to the music of a hymn sung by all the natives, we paddled out
of the lagoon.  The sea was smooth, though there was a fresh breeze; the
sail was hoisted, and away we glided at a rapid rate to the eastward.


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN.

A VOYAGE IN A SOUTH SEA CANOE.

Once more we were on the boundless ocean, out of sight of land, the
stars only as our guides, and the sagacity of the Polynesian chief and
his followers to depend on.  What made us feel most strange was our
utter ignorance where we were going.  From the quantity of provisions
and water the natives had thought it necessary to provide, it was
evident that we had a long voyage before us--perhaps many weeks might be
occupied in performing it.  We could scarcely hope not to experience a
gale of wind even in the Pacific during that time, and how could we hope
to weather it out in so frail a craft, especially deeply laden as we
were?

When Jerry and I expressed our apprehensions, after we had been some
days on board, and were beginning to get very tired of being cramped up,
the answer of Cousin Silas rebuked us,--"Trust in Providence, my lads--
on the arm of Him who has already preserved us from so many dangers.  
While they were searching for one their legs were nipped by some geese
driven by a little girl dressed in a sheepskin and carrying a switch.
George asked her name.

"Gilberte."
"Well, then, Gilberte, how can one go to the lake?"
"Folks doesn't go."
"Why?"
"Because..."
"But supposing folks did?"
"If folks did there'd be a path, and one would take that path."
George could think of no adequate reply to this guardian of the geese.

"Let's go," he said, "farther on we shall be sure to find a way through
the woods."
"And we will pick nuts and eat them," said Honey-Bee, "for I am hungry.
The next time we go to the lake we must bring a satchel full of good
things to eat."
"That we will, little sister," said George. "And I quite agree with
Francoeur, our squire, who when he went to Rome, took a ham with him, in
case he should hunger, and a flask lest he should be thirsty. But hurry,
for it is growing late, though I don't know the time."
"The shepherdesses know by looking at the sun," said Honey-Bee; "but
I am not a shepherdess. Yet it seems to me that when we left the sun
was over our head, and now it is down there, far behind the town and
castle of Clarides. I wonder if this happens every day and what it
means?"
While they looked at the sun a cloud of dust rose up from the high
road, and they saw some cavaliers with glittering weapons ride
past at full speed.

The children hid in the underbrush in great terror. "They are thieves
or probably ogres," they thought. They were really guards sent by the
Duchess of Clarides in search of the little truants.

The two little adventurers found a footpath in the underbrush, not
a lovers' lane, for it was impossible to walk side by side holding
hands as is the fashion of lovers. Nor could the print of human
footsteps be seen, but only indentations left by innumerable tiny
cloven feet.

"Those are the feet of little devils," said Honey-Bee.
"Or deer," suggested George.
The matter was never explained. But what is certain is that the
footpath descended in a gentle slope towards the edge of the lake
which lay before the two children in all its languorous and silent
beauty. The willows surrounded its banks with their tender foliage.Our progress was
slow, and we were unable to ascertain how long the voyage was likely to
last.  Hitherto we had enjoyed only the finest weather; the wind had
always been favourable, and even the strongest breeze which had wafted
us along had only covered the ocean with a brisk ripple.

I mentioned that one of the missionaries spoke a few words of English.
So great was his desire to acquire a further knowledge of the language,
that all day long he was engaged in learning it from one or other of us.
He first obtained a large vocabulary of substantives.  These he noted
down in a pocket-book which he cherished with great care, and then he

and unmanned, upon the vacant it from his junk-pile
No one who endured them, could ever forget the
horrors of that night.  "Had we been as we once were," continued the
missionary, "we should have resigned ourselves to our fate, and
perished; but we knew that it is the duty of Christians to strive to the
last, trusting in the arm of Him who is all-powerful to save, and while
prepared for death, never abandoning hope.  The morning at length came.
The other canoe was nowhere to be seen.  In vain we stood up and
strained our eyes on every side, as we rose to the top of a sea; not a
sign of her could we perceive.  Still we trusted that our friends might
have been preserved.  That day the gale blew as furiously as before; but
in the evening it moderated, though the sky was covered with clouds, and
we knew not whither we were drifting.  For several days we drifted on,
ignorant of our position.  Every morning, when daylight returned, we
looked out eagerly for our friends, but we never saw them again.  We
live in hope that they may have been preserved.  All is for the best.

"We thought that when the gale abated, and the sea grew calm, and the
sun came out, our sufferings would have an end; but they only then
began.  Our stock of water was becoming less and less.  Many of our
provisions had been so damaged by the sea, that they quickly decayed.
The sea became calm as the lagoon inside a coral isle; the sun burst
forth with intense heat; our thirst grew excessive.  Our island was
plentifully supplied with water, and we had always been accustomed to an
abundance; yet now we dared not drink more than the shell of a small nut
could hold at a time.  Carefully we husbanded the precious fluid; we had
learned to know its value.  At last the time came when not a drop
remained.  Every calabash was examined over and over again--the last
drop was drained out.  We sat down, and looked mournfully at each other.
Our thirst increased.  We dipped our heads in salt water--we
continually sprinkled each other over with it; but that did not convey
coolness to our parched tongues.  `We must die,' exclaimed some one.
`No, no,' answered one of our missionary brethren; `we will pray without
ceasing--we will trust in God.  He will send us relief when we least
expect it.'  That very evening a flight of sea-fowl flew close to the
canoe.  We were able to knock over several.  Their blood assisted to
quench our thirst; their flesh, too, revived our strength.  The next day
several fish were caught; but it was not food we wanted.  `Water! water!
water!' was the cry from old and young alike.  Still a day passed away--
there was no sign of land--no sign of rain.  The next day came;
intolerable was the thirst we endured by noon.  In vain we strained our
eyes through the hot, quivering atmosphere; the sky was blue and pure as
ever; not a speck could we discern in the horizon.  We had hoped that we
might reach the group of islands to which we had been bound; we
accordingly kept, as we believed, a direct course for it.  Another
morning broke.  During the night, our sufferings had been intense.
Could we survive through another day?  We stood up to glance round the
horizon.  Directly before us arose, as if sprouting out of the water, a
line of palm and cocoa-nut trees!  How eagerly we plied our oars to
reach the island on which they grew!  How thankfully our voices sang the
morning hymn, and uttered our accustomed prayers!  We rapidly neared the
spot.  We might have run close by it in the night without seeing it.  We
paddled round to find a spot on which to land.  Tantalising indeed was
it to see the ground where we might hope to gain life and strength, and
yet not be able to place our feet on it.  The infinite number of varied,
aggregated facts stored up by man's patient study of this universe are
irrelevant here, in a sketch of the progressive advance of his knowledge
of creation. Those who desire to examine the evidence which has led
to this verdict must go over the records themselves, or accept, out
of their own convictions, the result of the examination. To entirely
comprehend the Darwinian idea, one should be, to a certain extent,
familiar with the principles of science.

In other words, he should know more or less of what Darwin knows. He
should be familiar with the general results of man's study in the
different branches of science. He need not be an astronomer, a physicist,
a geologist, a zoölogist, a botanist; but he should have a general
acquaintance with the results of the labors of those who are such.
He should, to a certain extent, understand the workings of Natural
Law.

This is the great battle-ground on which the struggle is now taking place.
The point at issue is, whether the physical changes of the material
world, the introduction, continuance, and variation of organized beings,
are due to the direct, special intervention of Deity, or whether they
are the results of primeval laws, inherent in matter, and out of whose
workings spring the phenomena of nature. The adherents to the former
opinion maintain that the Deity has created all animals individually, or
in individual species, by direct action, apart from natural forces,
and indeed by an interference therewith. The votaries of the latter
deny special creation, and maintain that all animals are, like the rest
of the universe, the results of forces acting through all time,
producing, by their diverse changing influences, the variations which,
as they have widened and strengthened, have resulted in the difference
exhibited among animals. The first is the old traditional idea, having
its foundation in belief, and drawing its support from the Scriptures.
The last is the modern conviction, having its foundation in reason,
and drawing its support from the study of nature.

How are these differences among animate creatures--these wide contrasts
of form, size, and habits--produced, if not by God's special creation?
This is the question which Mr. Darwin and his school of thinkers
are seeking to answer.

Some half a century ago, M. Lamarck, a French naturalist, propounded a
theory which excited the derision of the whole world. He accounted for
these variations by suggesting that, as any special want was felt by an
animal, the body took on that structure which was required to relieve
it. To give a broad illustration: if men needed to fly for the support
of life, wings would gradually grow out from their shoulders. Ridiculous
as this may be, it showed that thinkers were at that time endeavoring
to account, on purely natural grounds, for what they considered
natural, and not supernatural phenomena.

Some twenty years ago, a book made its appearance which startled the
whole reading world, and caused as much dispute as Darwin has since
done. This was "Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation." It was
anonymous, and the author has never acknowledged it: to this day he
is unknown. This book was learned and lucid. It was received
with delight by those who were still looking for some explanation of
animal origin on natural grounds; and was derided quite as much as Lamarck's
work by the adherents to the old traditional belief. Scouted by the great
majority of naturalists, who still clung with tenacity to the notions
of their predecessors, stigmatized as atheistic and abominable by
theologians, it was first read with eagerness, and then put aside; and
though it went through many editions, it is now almost forgotten. But
this book was the beginning of Darwinism. It says:--
"We have seen powerful evidence that the construction of this globe
and its associates, and, inferentially, that of all the other globes
in space, was the result, not of any immediate or personal exertion
on the part of Deity, but of natural laws which are expressions of
his will.

What is to hinder our supposing that the organic creation is also
the result of natural laws, which are in like manner an expression
of his will?"
Referring to the Deity as the great motive-power of all the universe, the
author says:--
"To a reasonable mind the Divine attributes must appear, not diminished
or reduced in any way, by supposing a creation by law, but infinitely
exalted.

It is the narrowest of all views of the Deity, and characteristic of a
humble class of intellects, to suppose him acting constantly in particular
ways for particular occasions. It, for one thing, greatly detracts from
his foresight,--the most undeniable of all the attributes of Omnipotence.
It lowers him towards the level of our own humble intellects. Much
more worthy of him it surely is to suppose that all things have been
commissioned by him from the first, though neither is he absent from a
particle of the current of natural affairs in one sense, seeing that
the whole system is continually supported by his providence....
When all is seen to be the result of law, the idea of an Almighty
author becomes irresistible, for the creation of a law for an endless
series of phenomena--an act of intelligence above all else we can
conceive--could have no other imaginable source, and tells, moreover,
as powerfully for a sustaining as for an originating power."
He sums up the hypothesis which he seeks to sustain thus:--
"I suggest, then, as an hypothesis already countenanced by much that is
ascertained, and likely to be further sanctioned by much that remains
to be known, that the first step was _an advance, under favor of peculiar
circumstances, from the simplest forms of being to the next more
complicated, and this through the medium, of the ordinary process
of generation._"

And further:--
"_That the simplest and most primitive type, under a law to which that
of like production is subordinate, gave birth to the type next above
it; that this again produced the next higher, and so on to the very
highest_, the stages of advance being in all cases very small, namely,
from one species to another; so that the phenomenon has always
been of a simple and modest character."
In a Sequel which the author wrote, in answer to the numerous attacks
made upon him, he has the following:--
"The probable fact is, that the modification takes place in an offshoot
of the original tribe, which has removed into a different set of
circumstances, these circumstances being the cause of the change;
thus there is no need to presume that the original tribe is at all
affected by any such modification."
The author thus supposes that the variations among animals were
periodical and sudden, the results of some peculiar impetus given at
special periods. Later knowledge--the study of nature by the light
of greater experience--has exposed many errors in this work. Its
crudities have been made apparent; but the thought which pervaded it was
intrinsically right. The last passage quoted above foreshadows the more
elaborate speculations of the later philosopher.

In 1859 appeared Darwin's work, "On the Origin of Species, by Means
of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Races in the
Struggle for Life." Like its predecessors, it was a firebrand thrown
into the scientific camp. Like his predecessors, the author drew down
obloquy and anathemas from the clergy, sarcasm and vituperation
from the laity, and a host of replies from writers of all grades. Like
his predecessor, the author of the "Vestiges," he might have said,
in the words of Agassiz:--
"The history of the sciences is present to tell us that there are
few of the great truths now recognized which have not been treated
as chimerical and blasphemous before they were demonstrated."

Darwin, as he himself tells us in his Preface, spent twenty years
in a patient, laborious study of nature, having special reference
to this topic,--the origin of species.

Certain observations made in the course of his explorations in South
America led him to the convictions which subsequent study only strengthened;
and, after having spent years in the collection of facts bearing
upon the subject, he gave his theory to the world in the volume mentioned,
which was merely a digest of the facts.

It is perhaps needless to say, that Charles Darwin is a naturalist
of the highest rank; that he stands among the foremost men of the
day as a clear-minded, trustworthy, accurate, profound thinker.

The Darwinian theory is erected on the primary foundation of a natural
law acting through all time,--a persistent force which is applied to all
creation, immutable, unceasing, eternal; which determined the
revolutions of the igneous vapor out of which worlds were first
evolved; which determines now the color and shape of a rose-bud, the fall
of the summer leaves, the course of a rippling brook, the sparkle of
a diamond; which gives light to the sun and beauty to a woman's eye. It
rejects utterly the idea of special creation, and maintains that the
globe, as it exists to-day with all its myriad inhabitants, is only one
phase of that primeval vapor which by the force of that law has reached
its present state. As a little microscopic egg becomes in time a full-grown,
living, breathing, loving animal by the operation of natural laws which
we term growth, so has the universe, with its denizens, become what
it is by the workings of Natural Law.

The precise process by which sentient existence first became evolved
from inorganic matter seems to be beyond the scrutiny of man.

It is so far without the scope of his experience, his speculation
even, that it is futile to attempt to surmise it; although certain
interesting phenomena have attended the experiments of naturalists,
especially those of Professor Jeffries Wyman. Darwin takes the subject
up at the appearance of animal life, and seeks to work out the causes of
the present variation among animals, and to detect the _modus operandi_
by which the law of evolution has produced the multiform changes now
apparent. "Natural Selection" is his password into the great workshop of
Nature. The three great agencies at work there are the tendency of all
animals to transmit their peculiarities to their offspring, the
tendency of all animals to vary from their ancestors under varying
influences around them, and the constant changes taking place in
their surroundings.

"Natural Selection" are the words chosen to express the action of
animals under these conflicting forces. The power of external influence
upon structure is exhibited in the remarkable results of man's treatment
of plants and animals. The varieties of pears and apples are of his
producing; and the different breeds of domestic animals are the direct
consequences of his influence. The most astonishing instance of his power
is shown in pigeons, which are made, by skilful breeders, to assume
a great variety of shapes, colors, and habits. To what is this change
due? If a rock-pigeon were left to itself, it would produce only
rock-pigeons, unless some new influences were brought to bear by natural
causes. Man gives a rock-pigeon some peculiar food, subjects it
to some peculiar treatment, and the creature begins at once to change;
that is, to accommodate itself to the new circumstances by which it is
surrounded. The plastic nature undergoes an alteration correspondent
to the new state of existence. In a few generations these varieties are
indefinitely multiplied; and then, by crossing these varieties, new ones
are again produced. What is then the state of affairs? We have a series
of birds which, were they discovered in new countries, would be
considered to be new species. They differ in shape and color, in
the number of their vertebræ and ribs, the number of wing and tail feathers,
the number of scales on their toes, and various other anatomical
peculiarities. Here then is proof that animals, when exposed to influences
different from those which surrounded their ancestors, take on new forms
and characteristics. This is man's work. But is not man one of the many
agents in the work of the Great Prime Mover? Let us suppose that the
peculiar circumstances which produced a pouter or a fan-tail were
to remain in force for centuries; would not pouters or fan-tails
continue to procreate, and thus a new species be added to the genus?

What, then, becomes of special creation of every species of animal, if
man in a few years can produce a dozen forms out of one, any one of
which dozen is so distinct as to be deemed a new species, were it Nature's
work and not man's? The fact is thus demonstrated that animals become
varied in accordance with variations in their surroundings. This
simple fact, once substantiated, is the key to the whole subject. Man's
influence ceases when he leaves the animal to itself. But Nature never
leaves the animal to itself. Her changes are slight and slow; but they
never go back. They are permanent, only to be reaffected as the environment
alters. When we consider the incalculable, inconceivable lapse of
time through which organic life has been swayed by the never-ceasing
action of the forces around it, we can imagine what a vast variety of
animal forms may have been evolved from some one primal ancestor.

Darwin endeavors to explain, in detail, how this differentiation takes
place. The largest or strongest get the best food or the most
attractive females, and then transmit their strength or their peculiarities
to their progeny. These peculiarities are the results of the environment,
and if this shall go on changing in the direction of these peculiarities,
they will increase.

Suppose that the climate should gradually grow colder; the result might
be a denser growth of hair.
Those which, by strength or otherwise, chanced to have denser hair than
others, would more readily endure the change, and would transmit the
habit to their young; others less fitted to endure the change would die
out. In a short time the young would be born with the dense hair,
as it is well known that any new habit assumed by animals is exhibited
earlier and earlier in the young, as long as it is a necessity of
life. These variations are never due to one single cause. Organized life
is wrought upon by a wonderfully complex web of influences. Darwin has
the following passage touching the action of vegetable and animal life
upon each other.

"In Staffordshire, on the estate of a relation where I had ample means
of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath,
which had never been touched by the hand of man; but several hundred
acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years
previously, and planted with Scotch fir.

The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath
was most remarkable,--more than is generally seen in passing from one
quite different soil to another; not only the proportional numbers of
the heath plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants
(not counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which
could not be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must
have been still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common
in the plantations which were not to be seen on the heath; and the
heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here
we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single
tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception
that the land had been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But
how important an element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham in
Surrey. Here there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old
Scotch firs on the distant hill-tops; within the last ten years large
spaces have been enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in
multitudes, so close together that all cannot live. When I ascertained
that these young trees had not been sown or planted, I was so much surprised
at their numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could
examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and, literally, I could
not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on
looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found multitudes of
seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by
the cattle. In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant
from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and
one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during twenty-six
years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had
failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became
thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath
was so barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that
cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food.

"Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch
fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence
of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this;
for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though
they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and
Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in
Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of
these animals when first born.

The increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually
checked by some means, probably by birds. Hence if certain insectivorous
birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of
prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would decrease,--then
cattle and horses would become feral; and this would certainly greatly
alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation:
this, again, would largely affect the insects; and this, as we just
have seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in
ever-increasing circles of complexity."
In the struggle for life, the strongest live; or, in other words,
those best fitted to live in the environment endure. Animals and
plants produce in vast excess of the possibility of life. A destruction
of life is going on to an almost incredible amount. Were this
not the case, the slowest breeders in existence would soon cover
the earth so as to occupy every inch of space. Darwin reckons that
the elephant, the slowest breeder, if allowed to go on unchecked, and
to live his allotted term of years, would in five centuries produce fifteen
millions of elephants from one pair. If every cod's egg had developed
into a full-grown fish, the whole ocean would, ages ago, have been
packed with them, like herrings in a box. In this destruction, the
weaker animals and plants--those least fitted to thrive under the
influences around--become the prey of others better fitted for the
struggle, or die of their own lack of assimilative force. Thus, through
untold ages of shifting outward circumstances, the plastic forms of organic
life have been remoulded. A little obscure plant, the food of an insect,
dies out; the insect itself, deprived of its food, dies out or
migrates; the bird which fed upon it dies out or migrates; the
bird of prey follows the like course.

Migration introduces them to an entirely new state of existence,
temperature, food, and antagonists. The migrating animals are replaced
by others, which likewise experience new surroundings; and thus the
extirpation of a single plant may determine a long series of changes.
Instances of this kind are not uncommon. What must these changes have
been throughout the remote ages which have turned sea-shore mud into
uplifted mountain chains, and sunk long-stretching, sunny hills into
the ocean depths!

Darwin constructs his theory of gradual differentiation on the
evidence thus obtained.

He takes a given specific animal form, and supposes that, owing to
some external change in a given locality, it takes on some correspondent
variation. But all of the individuals of the species may not be likewise
affected. The circumstances may alter in one place and not in
another. The result will be two varieties of animal. The variety goes on
increasing in diversity, while the original still continues to produce
its like. By and by the variety, having a greater tendency to
vary, from its having already done so, undergoes a new differentiation,
the difference being, in all cases, slight, and the time between
the periods of maximum change being hundreds, thousands of years. One
of the new varieties may by peculiar circumstances take on a special
amplitude of growth, while the other, peculiarly circumstanced,
may be contracted and dwarfed.

One of the original varieties may by this time have disappeared. The
original itself may have disappeared. Thus the connecting link between
the two forms is lost. The more individualized form may go on
accenting its own peculiar characters, and again be broken into
new varieties, some of which may retain the old characters in
circumscribed areas, while others may increase in greater abundance
and occupy a much wider area.

The wider the field of life, the more numerous the differing influences
and the more diverse the conditions the animal must undergo.

Thence arise more differentiations.

After the lapse of some millions of ages, these constantly forking growths
will have taken on a diversity to which that of the pouters and
fan-tails is trifling.

Some forms may be less plastic than others, and give way less readily
to the incident forces.

These may remain unchanged for a far longer period than subsequent varieties,
and be coexistent with them. Some varieties may take on a cerebral
growth as widely different and as strongly individualized as frame
structure. Man himself is a striking instance.

The Negro, the Malay, the Mongolian, are almost precisely what they were
five thousand years ago. The Bushman, the Hottentot, the Patagonian, and
the Digger Indian are to-day not much above the animals about them;
while the Caucasian has gone on in a wonderful advancement, leaving
the other races in the same state of development in which they were when
the Caucasian was no farther advanced than they. And here is perhaps
the place to allude to the derisive objection to Darwinism, that it
makes man an improved monkey. Darwin's theory certainly gives
to both some vastly remote common ancestor; but it does not maintain the
metamorphosis of one into the other. It does not suppose that man was
once a gorilla. It supposes that from out of some of the
differentiations of some animal form arose the first man-like creature,
and that, gradually changing, like other animal forms, some of the
varieties eventually evolved into apes and orangoutangs, to stop
there and die out like hosts of other forms now extinct. But from some
strongly individualized variety sprang, with more rapid and advancing
growth, the primitive man, who has, under complex influences, differentiated
into the so-called races of mankind. We talk of man as being something
infinitely above all animals. There is a vast difference between the
highest and lowest species of the genus _homo_. Were the race confined
to those lowest species, we imagine that European and American
pride of nature would go before a grievous fall.

These constantly succeeding changes are supposed to have taken place
during the whole time that this earth has been fitted for animal
life,--a period of time so long that the human mind is unable to
grasp it.

One objection to this theory, strongly insisted on, is the absence
of any evidence of connecting links between man and the lower
animals, or between the strongly defined demarcations of the animal
orders.

Just as the sun was setting, we thought we saw a faint
blue peak rising out of the water, but even the most practised eye could
not determine whether it was land or a light cloud.  We continued the
same course during the night.  For several hours I watched, then,
overcome by fatigue, I fell asleep.  "See! see!"  I heard Jerry exclaim.
I jumped up.  There appeared before us the lofty and rugged peaks of a
line of mountains.  Of great height they seemed, after the low land to
which our eyes had been so long accustomed.  Their sides were clothed
with verdure, pleasant and refreshing to the sight; and at their bases
were groves, and fields, and sparkling streams, with heat pretty-looking
cottages scattered about.  There was a slight swell.  When the canoe
rose to the top of it, we could see a yellow beach, with a circle of
bright, blue, calm water around it, and outside a line of white foaming
breakers, the guardians of the shore.  "Otaheite!  Otaheite!" exclaimed
the chief and his followers; and we thus knew that we were on the coast
of the dominion of the ill-treated Queen Pomare; but we also knew that
there were civilised men on shore, and that we should probably be
received there with kindness and hospitality.

Soon discovering a passage through the reef, we ran in, and were at once
surrounded by canoes full of people, wondering who we were and whence we
had come.  Our friends quickly gave an outline of our and their
adventures, to satisfy curiosity.  They found there several people from
their own island, one a chief who had become a wealthy man.  He took
them to his own house, and had their canoe hauled up to be repaired.  I
need not say that she was visited by all the foreign residents, curious
to examine a craft of so frail a structure which had performed so long a
voyage.  Our consul was very civil to us, and we were received into the
house of an English gentleman, who treated us with the greatest
kindness.  As we met with no very interesting adventures during our stay
here, I will content myself with giving a brief account of the island.

Otaheite was discovered in 1767, by Captain Wallis, who called it King
George's Island; but it is better known by the name of Tahiti.  It is of
volcanic formation, and consists of two peninsulas joined by a neck of
low land, about two miles across.  The whole island is about thirty
miles in circumference.  The smaller portion, called Tairaboo, is the
most fertile; but as Tahiti proper has the best harbour, it is the most
frequented, and is the seat of government.

We know very little of the history of the island.  Soon after its
discovery, a chief, who assumed the title of Pomare the First, made
himself king.  His son, and then his grandson, succeeded him, and the
present queen is his granddaughter; her name is Aimata, but she has
taken the title of Pomare the Fourth.  She has established a
constitution, and seven chiefs act as her ministers.  For many years
both the chiefs and people have professed Christianity, having been
converted to a knowledge of the truth by Protestant missionaries.  These
missionaries were undoubtedly earnest, pious men, but they have been
unable altogether to check the vices which the lawless rovers, outcasts
of every civilised nation in the world, have introduced among them.
Notwithstanding the counteracting influences I have mentioned,
civilisation was making progress in the island, under the teaching of
the Protestant missionaries, when the peace was disturbed by the arrival
of two French Roman Catholic priests.  They travelled about the country
endeavouring to teach their doctrines, but in no place did they find
willing hearers.  A few chiefs who were in opposition to the Government
for political motives, gave them some countenance, and they were
entertained at the house of the American consul.  The people, however,
resolved that they should not remain to attempt the corruption of the
faith in which they had been instructed, and rising in a body, compelled
them to go on board a small vessel, which carried them to Wallis Island,
two thousand miles off.  The French who had long desired the possession
of some island in the Pacific inhabited by partly civilised people, were
too glad to found a pretext on this circumstance for interfering in the
affairs of Tahiti.  A frigate, the _Venus_, commanded by Monsieur Du
Petit Thouars, entered the harbour of Papieti.  The French, captain,
bringing his guns to bear on the town, demanded satisfaction for the
outrage committed on his countrymen.  The queen was inclined to resist,
but the foreign inhabitants, knowing that they should be the chief
sufferers, collected the amount demanded, which was at least four times
as much as any pecuniary loss the priests had incurred.  He also forced
a treaty on the queen, by which Frenchmen were allowed to visit the
island at pleasure, to erect churches, and to practise their religion.
This was the commencement of the complete subjugation of the Tahitians
to the French.  So much for the history of the island.

The valleys, and a plain which extends from the sea-shore to the spurs
of the mountains, are very fertile, and produce in great abundance all
tropical plants.  The climate is warm, but not enervating; the scenery
is in many parts very beautiful.  Thus the natives are tempted to lead
an easy and idle life, exerting but little their physical and mental
powers.  It is, indeed, to their credit that they do not altogether
abandon themselves to indolence.  They are by nature constituted to
enjoy the beautiful scenes by which they are surrounded.  Consequently,
they delight in building their cottages in the most retired and lovely
spots they can find.  Their habitations are surrounded with fences,
inside which they cultivate the taro, and sweet potatoes, the banana,
the bread-fruit, the vi-apple, groves of orange and cocoa-nut trees, and
at times the sugar-cane.  Their habitations are of an oval shape, often
fifty or sixty feet long, and twenty wide.  They are formed of bamboos,
planted about an inch apart in the ground.  At the top of each wall thus
formed, a piece of the hibiscus, a strong and light wood, is lashed with
plaited rope.  _Bonne_ is a good town, well walled-in, pleasantly situated,
and remarkable for an excellent and well-conducted Hospital, where the
poor sick are received _gratis_, without distinction, and where the
rich sick are accommodated with nurses, physicians, medicines, food,
and lodging, with every assistance that can be wanted, for four livres
a day. The apartments in which the poor are received, are so perfectly
clean and sweet, that they are fit for people of any condition; but
those provided for the better sort, are indeed sumptuously furnished.
The women who act as nurses, are of a religious order, and wear a
particular, decent, and uniform habit, to which their modest deportment
exactly coincides; yet most of them are young, and many of them
very beautiful.

Between these two towns we met an English servant, in a rich laced livery,
conducting, behind a post-chaise, a large quantity of baggage; and
soon after, a second servant, in the same uniform; this excited our
curiosity, and we impatiently proceeded, in hopes of meeting the
equipage, which it was natural to expect would soon follow; instead
of which, it was an old English four-wheel chaise, the _contents_ of
which were buckled close up behind a pair of dirty leather curtains;
and on the coach-box sat, by the side of the driver, a man who
had the appearance of an English farmer. This contrast rather increased
than lessened our curiosity; and, therefore, at _Bonne_, I made some
enquiry about them of the post-master; who told me they came in, and
set off, separately, just as I had met them; but that one servant paid
for the horses to all the carriages, and that the woman _behind the
curtain, according to custom, did not chuse to shew herself_. Just as I
was returning with this blind account, an English servant, who I had
not perceived, but who stood near, told me, he was sure _as how_
it was either the _Duchess_ of _Kingston_ or _Mrs Rudd_, for that he
_seed_ her very plain. I was much surprized at finding an Englishman
so near me; and the singularity of the man's observation had a
very forcible effect upon me. When the mirth which it unavoidably occasioned,
was a little subsided, I could not help correcting, in gentle terms,
(though I was otherwise glad to see even an English footman so far from
_English land_) a man in his station for speaking of people of high
rank with so much indecent levity, and then told him, that there was no
such person living as the _Duchess_ of _Kingston_, but that it was
probable the Lady he thought he had seen might be _Lady Bristol_;
that there was not however, the least resemblance between the person of
her Ladyship and the other Lady he had mentioned, the latter being
young, thin, and rather handsome; whereas _Lady Bristol_ was very
fat, and advanced in years; I therefore suspected, I told him,
that he had confounded the trials of those two Ladies, and fancied he
saw a likeness in their persons, by an association of ideas; but in
reality, there was as much difference in their crimes as in their
persons. _Crimes_! did I say?
that is an improper expression, because I am informed _Mrs. Rudd_
has been acquitted; but that, if the foreign papers might be relied
on, _Lady Bristol_ had been found guilty of BIGAMY: But as he
seemed not to understand what I meant by _Bigamy_, or the _association
of ideas_, I was unavoidably led into a conversation, and explanation,
with this young man; which nothing but my pride, and his ignorance,
could justify; but as the fellow was overjoyed to see me, I could
not help giving him something to drink, and with it a caution never
to speak of people of high rank and condition, even behind their
backs, but under their proper names or titles, and with decency and
respect: he then begged my pardon, and assured me, if he had known
that either of the Ladies had been a friend of mine, he would not
have coupled them so improperly together; and I am thoroughly
convinced, the man left me with a resolution, never to hazard a
conjecture without a better foundation than that he started to me,
and which I rather believe he hit off _extempore_, to speak to me,
and shew himself my countryman, than from really suspecting that
the woman behind the curtain was either _Lady Bristol_, or _Mrs.

Rudd_; though I was inclined to think it very probable, for I had seen
_Lord Bristol_ on his way through _Lyons_ from _Italy_ to _England_,
and had been informed, _Lady Bristol_ was then on her road to _Italy_;
in which case, I, like the footman, had my conjectures, and accounted
for the leather curtains being so _closely buckled to_.

These are trifling remarks, you will say; but if a sign-painter can
paint only a bear, those who employ him must have a bear for their
sign; nevertheless, we have all a certain curiosity to know even the
most trifling actions, or movements of people, who by their virtues or
vices, especially if they are people of rank or condition, have
occasioned much talk in the world; and therefore, ridiculous as
this incident is, yet as we have long known one of the Ladies, and
often _admired_ both, I could not let either one or the other pass
me unnoticed, on a road too, where even an English Duchess (if she
would own the truth) would feel a secret delight in meeting of a
Hyde-park-corner groom.

I have already mentioned what partiality and degree of notice, countrymen
take of each other when they meet far from home. That notice is always
in proportion to the distance. Had my _Bonne_ footman spoke of _Lady
Bristol_, or _Mrs. Rudd_, in such free terms as _how he seed 'em_,
&c. &c. at Hyde-park-corner, or in Tyburn-road, I should have knocked him
down with the but end of my whip; but at _Bonne_ (five hundred miles
from either of those places) he and I were _quatre cousins_; and I
could not help treating him with a bottle of _vin de pais_.

LETTER L.

From _Bonne_ we intended to have taken the high road to _Dijon_; but
being informed that there was another, though not much frequented, by
way of _Autun_, and that _that_ town, which was a Roman colony, still
contained many curious monuments worthy of notice, we pursued the
latter, which twisted in between a vast variety of small, but fertile
valleys, watered with brooks, bounded by romantic hills, and some high
mountains, most of which were covered with vines, which _did_ produce
the most delicious red wine in the world; I say _did produce_, for the
high _gout_ and flavour of the Burgundy grape has for many years
failed, and perhaps so as never to return again. We, however, missed
the road to _Autun_, and, after four leagues' journey through a most
delightful country, we arrived at a miserable auberge in a dirty
village called _Yozy_, which stands upon the margin of a large forest,
in which, some years since, the _diligence_ from _Lyons_ to _Paris_
was attacked by a banditti, and the whole party of travellers were murdered:
ever since that fatal day, a guard of the _Marechaussee_ always escort
the _diligence_ through this deep and dreadful forest, (so they
called it), and we were persuaded it was right to take a couple of the
_Marechaussee_, and did so; but as we found the forest by no means so
long, deep, or dreadful, as it had been represented, we suspected that
the advice given us, was more for the sake of the men who _guarded
us_, than from any regard _to us_, two men could have made no great
resistance against a banditti; and a single man would hardly
have meddled with us.

The next day we passed thro' _Arnay-le-Duc_, a pretty country village,
three leagues from _Yozy_, and it being their annual fair-day, we had an
opportunity of seeing all the peasantry, dressed in their best, and
much chearfulness, not only in the town, but upon the road before we
arrived, and after we passed it. Amongst the rest of the company, were
a bear and a monkey, or rather what _Buffon_ calls the _maggot_. I desired
the shew-man to permit my _maggot_, as he was the least, the youngest,
and the _stranger_, to pay a visit to _Mons. Maggot_, the elder, who
embraced the _young gentleman_ in a manner which astonished and
delighted every body, myself only excepted; but as _my young
gentleman_ seemed totally indifferent about the _old one_, I suspected
he had _really met his father_, and I could not help moralizing a
little.

From _Arnay-le-Duc_ we passed through _Maupas_, _Salou_, _Rouvray_, _Quisse
la forge_, and _Vermanton_ to _Auxerre_, the town where the French
nobleman _was said_ to live, whom Dr. _Smollett_ treated so very
roughly, and who, in return, was so _polite_ as to _help to tie_
the Doctor's baggage behind his coach!

About a quarter of a mile without this town, stands a royal convent,
richly endowed, and delightfully situated; the walls of which take in
near twenty acres of land, well planted on the banks of a river; and
here I left my two daughters, to perfect themselves in the French language,
as there was not one person within the convent, nor that I could find,
within the town, who could speak a word of English. And here I must not
omit to tell you, how much I was overcome with the generosity of this
virtuous, and I must add amiable, society of _religieux_. Upon my first
inquiry about their price for board, lodging, washing, cloaths,
and in short, every thing the children did, or might want, they
required a sum much beyond the limits of my scanty income to give;
but before we left them, they became acquainted with _some
circumstances_, which induced them to express their concern that
the price I had offered (not half what they had demanded) could not
be taken.

We therefore retired, and had almost fixed the children in a cheaper
convent, but much inferior in all respects, within the town, when we
received a polite letter from the Lady Abbess, to say, that after
consulting with her sister-hood, they had come to a resolution to
take the children at our _own_ price, rather than not shew how much they
wished to oblige us.
Upon this occasion, we were _all_ admitted within the walls of the
convent; and I had the pleasure of seeing my two daughters joined to
an elegant troop of about forty genteel children, and of leaving them
under the care of the same number of _religieux_. And yet these good
people knew nothing of us, but what we ourselves communicated to them,
not being known, nor knowing any person in the town.--The Lady-Abbess
of this convent is a woman of high rank, about twenty-four years
of age, and possesses as large a share of beauty as any reasonable
woman, even on the _outside_ of a convent, could wish for.

_Auxerre_ is a good town, pleasantly situated, and in a plentiful and
cheap country.

From _Auxerre_ to _Ioigni_ is five leagues. The _Petit bel Vue_ on the
banks of the river is very pleasantly situated, but a dreadful one
within side, in every respect, being a mixture of dirt, ignorance, and
imposition; but it is the only inn for travellers, and therefore
travellers should avoid it. In order to put my old hostess in good humour,
I called early for a bottle of Champaigne; and in order to put me
into a bad humour, she charged me the next day for two; but I
_charged her_ with _Mons.

Le Connetable_, who behaved like a gentleman, though I think he was only
a _marchand de tonneau_: but then he was a _wine_ not _beer_ cooper,
who hooped the old Lady's barrel.

Where-ever I was ill-used or imposed upon, I always sent a pretty heavy
packet by the post, after I had run down a hundred miles or two, by way
of _draw-back_, upon my host, and recompence to the King's high road; for
in France,
_"Like the Quakers' by-way, 'Tis plain without turnpikes, so nothing to
pay"_
An old witch, who had half starved us at _Montpellier_, for want of
provisions, when we went, and for want of fire to dry us, when we came
back, left a piece of candle in my budget, which I did not omit to return
by the post, _well packed up_, lest it should grease other packets of
more importance, by riding an hundred leagues; besides this it was
accompanied by a very civil _letter of advice_, under another
cover.

LETTER LI.

The next town of any note is _Sens_, a large, _ragged_, ancient city;
but adorned with a most noble Gothic cathedral, more magnificent than
even that of _Rheims_, and well worthy of the notice of strangers; it
is said to have been built by the English: With the relicks and
_custodiums_ of the host, are shewn the sacerdotal habits, in which
Archbishop _Becket_ (who resided there many years) said mass, for
it was his head-quarters, when he _left_ Britain, as well as _Julius
Cæsar_'s before he went there.

The silver hasps, and some of the ornaments of these garments, are still
perfect, though it has undergone so many darnings, as to be little
else.

_Becket_ was a very tall man; for though it has many tucks in it, yet it
is generally too long for the tallest priest in the town, who
constantly says mass in it on _St. Thomas_'s day.

How times and men are changed! This town, which resisted the arms of _Cæsar_
for a considerable time, was put in the utmost consternation by _Dr.
Smollett_'s causing his travelling blunderbuss to be only fired in the
air, a circumstance "which greatly terrified all the _petit monde!_"
It is very singular, that the Doctor should have frightened a French
nobleman of _Burgundy_, by shaking his cane at him, and even made
him assist in the most servile offices; and in the next town, terrify
all the common people, by only firing a blunderbuss in the air!

I would not willingly arraign a dead man with telling two fibbs so close
upon the back of each other; but I am sure there was but that single
French nobleman, in this mighty kingdom, who would have submitted to
such insults as the Doctor _says_ he treated him with; nor any other
town but _Sens_, where the firing of a gun would have so terrified the
inhabitants; for, drums, guns, and noise of every sort, seem to afford
the common French people infinite pleasure.

I spent in this town a day or two, and part of that time with a very
agreeable Scotch family, of the name of _Macdonald_, where Lieutenant
Colonel _Stuart_ was then upon a visit.

I have some reason to think that _Sens_ is a very cheap town. Several
English, Scotch, and Irish families reside in it.

From _Sens_ to _Port sur Yonne_ is three leagues, and from _Yonne_
to _Foussart_ the same distance.

At the three Kings at _Foussart_, suspecting there was a cat behind the
bed in wait for my bird, I found, instead thereof, a little _narrow
door_, which was artfully hid, and which opened into another room; and
as I am sure the man is a cheat, I suspect too, that upon a _good
occasion_, he would have made some _use_ of his little door.

Cousin Silas hurried on deck, and, taking a glance round,
ordered the helm to be put up again, the yards to be squared, and the
courses which had been clewed up to be let fall.  It was our only
chance.  The ship's head swung round; once more she moved--grating on,
and, the doctor said, tearing away the work of myriads of polypi.
"Hurrah! hurrah!" a shout arose from all forward.  We were free.  Away
we flew.

This narrow escape ought to have been a warning to all on board.
Unhappily it was not.  The same system was pursued as before.  The other
mates grow jealous of Cousin Silas, and did their utmost to counteract
his efforts.  One night Jerry and I were on deck, actively moving about,
followed by Old Surley, looking out in every direction; for it was very
dark, and the officers had been having a carouse.  For some reason or
other I was more than usually uneasy.  So was Jerry.

"I should not wonder," said he, "that something will happen before
long."

"I hope not, if it is something bad," said I; "but I'm not altogether
happy.  I think that I will go and call Mr Brand."

"What shall we say to him, though?  There will be no use rousing him up
till we have something to tell him."  I agreed with Jerry, so we
continued talking as before.

"What are you youngsters about there?" shouted the first mate, who,
although it was his watch, was half tipsy.  "Go below, and turn in; I'll
not have chattering monkeys like you disturbing the discipline of the
ship."  Jerry and I hesitated about obeying, and Jerry whispered to me
that he would go and call Mr Brand.  But the mate sung out, "Mutiny!
mutiny!  Go to your own kennels, you young hounds!" and ordered some of
the watch on deck to carry out his commands.  We could not help
ourselves, so we went below, and turning into our berths very soon fell
asleep.

How long we had been asleep I do not know.  I was awoke by a terrific
crash and loud cries and shrieks.  Jerry and I sprung up, so indeed did
everybody below, and rushed on deck.  It was very dark; but from the way
the ship heaved and lurched, and the sheets of foam which flew over her,
we knew that she was among the breakers, and striking hard on a reef.
The fore-mast and main-mast had gone by the board.  The mizzen-mast
alone stood.  That fell soon after we got on deck, crushing several
people beneath it.  Anxiously we hunted about shouting for Cousin Silas,
followed by Old Surley, who, since we came on board, scarcely ever left
our heels.  We naturally sought him for advice.  It was, indeed, a
relief to us to find him unhurt.  In a short time we discovered the
doctor and Ben.  We clustered together, holding on by the bulwarks; for
every now and then a sea came and washed over the decks, and we ran
great risk of being carried away.  Nothing could we see on either side
beyond the white roaring breakers.  Cousin Silas said that he was
certain we must have been driven some way on the reef, or the sea would
have broken more completely over us, and no one could have hoped to
escape.  But my teacher had been with me several weeks before I understood
that everything has a name.

One day, while I was playing with my new doll, Miss Sullivan put my big
rag doll into my lap also, spelled "d-o-l-l" and tried to make me
understand that "d-o-l-l" applied to both. Earlier in the day we
had had a tussle over the words "m-u-g" and "w-a-t-e-r." Miss Sullivan
had tried to impress it upon me that "m-u-g" is mug and that "w-a-t-e-r"
is _water_, but I persisted in confounding the two. In despair she had
dropped the subject for the time, only to renew it at the first
opportunity. I became impatient at her repeated attempts and, seizing
the new doll, I dashed it upon the floor. I was keenly delighted when I
felt the fragments of the broken doll at my feet. Neither sorrow nor
regret followed my passionate outburst. I had not loved the doll. In
the still, dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment
or tenderness. I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of
the hearth, and I had a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my
discomfort was removed. She brought me my hat, and I knew I was going
out into the warm sunshine. This thought, if a wordless sensation may
be called a thought, made me hop and skip with pleasure.

We walked down the path to the well-house, attracted by the fragrance
of the honeysuckle with which it was covered. Some one was drawing water
and my teacher placed my hand under the spout. As the cool stream
gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first
slowly, then rapidly. I stood still, my whole attention fixed upon the
motions of her fingers. Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of
something forgotten--a thrill of returning thought; and somehow the mystery
of language was revealed to me. I knew then that "w-a-t-e-r" meant the
wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand. That living word
awakened my soul, gave it light, hope, joy, set it free!

There were barriers still, it is true, but barriers that could in time
be swept away.

I left the well-house eager to learn. Everything had a name, and each
name gave birth to a new thought. As we returned to the house every object
which I touched seemed to quiver with life. That was because I saw
everything with the strange, new sight that had come to me. On entering
the door I remembered the doll I had broken.

I felt my way to the hearth and picked up the pieces. I tried vainly to
put them together. Then my eyes filled with tears; for I realized what
I had done, and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow.

I learned a great many new words that day. I do not remember what they
all were; but I do know that _mother_, _father_, _sister_, _teacher_
were among them--words that were to make the world blossom for me, "like
Aaron's rod, with flowers." It would have been difficult to find a
happier child than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful
day and lived over the joys it had brought me, and for the first time
longed for a new day to come.

I had now the key to all language, and I was eager to learn to use it.
Children who hear acquire language without any particular effort;
the words that fall from others' lips they catch on the wing, as
it were, delightedly, while the little deaf child must trap them
by a slow and often painful process.

But whatever the process, the result is wonderful. Gradually from naming
an object we advance step by step until we have traversed the vast
distance between our first stammered syllable and the sweep of thought
in a line of Shakespeare.

At first, when my teacher told me about a new thing I asked very few
questions. My ideas were vague, and my vocabulary was inadequate; but as
my knowledge of things grew, and I learned more and more words,
my field of inquiry broadened, and I would return again and again
to the same subject, eager for further information.

Sometimes a new word revived an image that some earlier experience
had engraved on my brain.

I remember the morning that I first asked the meaning of the word,
"love." This was before I knew many words. I had found a few early violets
in the garden and brought them to my teacher. She tried to kiss me;
but at that time I did not like to have any one kiss me except my
mother. Miss Sullivan put her arm gently round me and spelled into my
hand, "I love Helen."
"What is love?" I asked.

She drew me closer to her and said, "It is here," pointing to my heart,
whose beats I was conscious of for the first time. Her words puzzled me
very much because I did not then understand anything unless I touched
it.

I smelt the violets in her hand and asked, half in words, half in
signs, a question which meant, "Is love the sweetness of flowers?"

"No," said my teacher.

Again I thought. The warm sun was shining on us.

"Is this not love?" I asked, pointing in the direction from which
the heat came, "Is this not love?"
It seemed to me that there could be nothing more beautiful than the sun,
whose warmth makes all things grow. But Miss Sullivan shook her head,
and I was greatly puzzled and disappointed. I thought it strange that
my teacher could not show me love.

A day or two afterward I was stringing beads of different sizes in symmetrical
groups--two large beads, three small ones, and so on. I had made many
mistakes, and Miss Sullivan had pointed them out again and again with
gentle patience.

Finally I noticed a very obvious error in the sequence and for an instant
I concentrated my attention on the lesson and tried to think how I should
have arranged the beads. Miss Sullivan touched my forehead and
spelled with decided emphasis, "Think."
In a flash I knew that the word was the name of the process that was
going on in my head. This was my first conscious perception of an abstract
idea.

For a long time I was still--I was not thinking of the beads in my lap,
but trying to find a meaning for "love" in the light of this new
idea.
The sun had been under a cloud all day, and there had been brief showers;
but suddenly the sun broke forth in all its southern splendour.

Again I asked my teacher, "Is this not love?"
"Love is something like the clouds that were in the sky before the sun
came out," she replied. Then in simpler words than these, which at that
time I could not have understood, she explained: "You cannot touch the
clouds, you know; but you feel the rain and know how glad the
flowers and the thirsty earth are to have it after a hot day. You cannot
touch love either; but you feel the sweetness that it pours into
everything. Without love you would not be happy or want to play."
The beautiful truth burst upon my mind--I felt that there were invisible
lines stretched between my spirit and the spirits of others.

From the beginning of my education Miss Sullivan made it a practice to
speak to me as she would speak to any hearing child; the only difference
was that she spelled the sentences into my hand instead of speaking them.
If I did not know the words and idioms necessary to express my thoughts
she supplied them, even suggesting conversation when I was unable to keep
up my end of the dialogue.

This process was continued for several years; for the deaf child does
not learn in a month, or even in two or three years, the numberless
idioms and expressions used in the simplest daily intercourse. The little
hearing child learns these from constant repetition and imitation.
The conversation he hears in his home stimulates his mind and suggests
topics and calls forth the spontaneous expression of his own thoughts.
This natural exchange of ideas is denied to the deaf child. My teacher,
realizing this, determined to supply the kinds of stimulus I lacked.
This she did by repeating to me as far as possible, verbatim, what she
heard, and by showing me how I could take part in the conversation.
But it was a long time before I ventured to take the initiative, and
still longer before I could find something appropriate to say at the
right time.

The next important step in my education was learning to read.

As soon as I could spell a few words my teacher gave me slips of
cardboard on which were printed words in raised letters.

I quickly learned that each printed word stood for an object, an
act, or a quality.

I had a frame in which I could arrange the words in little sentences;
but before I ever put sentences in the frame I used to make them in
objects. I found the slips of paper which represented, for example, "doll,"
"is," "on," "bed" and placed each name on its object; then I put my doll
on the bed with the words _is_, _on_, _bed_ arranged beside the doll,
thus making a sentence of the words, and at the same time carrying out
the idea of the sentence with the things themselves.

One day, Miss Sullivan tells me, I pinned the word _girl_ on my
pinafore and stood in the wardrobe. On the shelf I arranged the words,
_is_, _in_, _wardrobe_. Nothing delighted me so much as this game. My
teacher and I played it for hours at a time.

Often everything in the room was arranged in object sentences.

From the printed slip it was but a step to the printed book. I took my
"Reader for Beginners" and hunted for the words I knew; when I found
them my joy was like that of a game of hide-and-seek. Thus I began to
read. Of the time when I began to read connected stories I shall speak
later.

For a long time I had no regular lessons. Even when I studied most
earnestly it seemed more like play than work. Everything Miss Sullivan
taught me she illustrated by a beautiful story or a poem. Whenever anything
delighted or interested me she talked it over with me just as if she
were a little girl herself.

What many children think of with dread, as a painful plodding through
grammar, hard sums and harder definitions, is to-day one of my most
precious memories.

I cannot explain the peculiar sympathy Miss Sullivan had with my pleasures
and desires. Perhaps it was the result of long association with the blind.
Added to this she had a wonderful faculty for description. She
went quickly over uninteresting details, and never nagged me with questions
to see if I remembered the day-before-yesterday's lesson. She
introduced dry technicalities of science little by little, making
every subject so real that I could not help remembering what she taught.

We read and studied out of doors, preferring the sunlit woods to the
house. All my early lessons have in them the breath of the woods--the
fine, resinous odour of pine needles, blended with the perfume of
wild grapes.

Seated in the gracious shade of a wild tulip tree, I learned to think
that everything has a lesson and a suggestion.

Our favourite walk was to Keller's Landing, an old tumble-down lumber-wharf
on the Tennessee River, used during the Civil War to land soldiers.
There we spent many happy hours and played at learning geography. I
built dams of pebbles, made islands and lakes, and dug river-beds, all
for fun, and never dreamed that I was learning a lesson. I listened with
increasing wonder to Miss Sullivan's descriptions of the great
round world with its burning mountains, buried cities, moving rivers
of ice, and many other things as strange.

She made raised maps in clay, so that I could feel the mountain ridges
and valleys, and follow with my fingers the devious course of rivers.

I liked this, too; but the division of the earth into zones and poles
confused and teased my mind. The illustrative strings and the orange
stick representing the poles seemed so real that even to this day the
mere mention of temperate zone suggests a series of twine circles; and I
believe that if any one should set about it he could convince me that
white bears actually climb the North Pole.

Arithmetic seems to have been the only study I did not like. From the
first I was not interested in the science of numbers. Miss Sullivan
tried to teach me to count by stringing beads in groups, and by
arranging kindergarten straws I learned to add and subtract. I never
had patience to arrange more than five or six groups at a time. When I
had accomplished this my conscience was at rest for the day, and I
went out quickly to find my playmates.

In this same leisurely manner I studied zoology and botany.

Once a gentleman, whose name I have forgotten, sent me a collection
of fossils--tiny mollusk shells beautifully marked, and bits of sandstone
with the print of birds' claws, and a lovely fern in bas-relief. These
were the keys which unlocked the treasures of the antediluvian world
for me. With trembling fingers I listened to Miss Sullivan's descriptions
of the terrible beasts, with uncouth, unpronounceable names, which
once went tramping through the primeval forests, tearing down the
branches of gigantic trees for food, and died in the dismal swamps of an
unknown age. For a long time these strange creatures haunted my
dreams, and this gloomy period formed a sombre background to the joyous
Now, filled with sunshine and roses and echoing with the gentle
beat of my pony's hoof.
Another time a beautiful shell was given me, and with a child's
surprise and delight I learned how a tiny mollusk had built the
lustrous coil for his dwelling place, and how on still nights, when
there is no breeze stirring the waves, the Nautilus sails on the
blue waters of the Indian Ocean in his "ship of pearl."
It was in the spring of 1890 that I learned to speak. The impulse
to utter audible sounds had always been strong within me. I used
to make noises, keeping one hand on my throat while the other hand
felt the movements of my lips. I was pleased with anything that
made a noise and liked to feel the cat purr and the dog bark. I
also liked to keep my hand on a singer's throat, or on a piano when
it was being played.
Before I lost my sight and hearing, I was fast learning to talk,
but after my illness it was found that I had ceased to speak because
I could not hear. I used to sit in my mother's lap all day long and
keep my hands on her face because it amused me to feel the motions
of her lips; and I moved my lips, too, although I had forgotten
what talking was. My friends say that I laughed and cried naturally,
and for a while I made many sounds and word-elements, not because
they were a means of communication, but because the need of exercising
my vocal organs was imperative. There was, however, one word the
meaning of which I still remembered, water. I pronounced it "wa-wa."
Even this became less and less intelligible until the time when
Miss Sullivan began to teach me. I stopped using it only after I
had learned to spell the word on my fingers.
I had known for a long time that the people about me used a method
of communication different from mine; and even before I knew that
a deaf child could be taught to speak, I was conscious of dissatisfaction
with the means of communication I already possessed. One who is
entirely dependent upon the manual alphabet has always a sense of
restraint, of narrowness. This feeling began to agitate me with a
vexing, forward-reaching sense of a lack that should be filled. My
thoughts would often rise and beat up like birds against the wind;
and I persisted in using my lips and voice.We had still a good supply of powder and
balls, so, loading all the muskets, we prepared for an attack.
Horrified as I had been at the slaughter of our late shipmates, my great
anxiety was about Jerry.  I hoped that his life might be safe, but it
was a sad fate to be kept in captivity by such treacherous and
bloodthirsty savages as these had showed themselves to be.  I asked Mr
Brand where he thought we were.  He replied that he had no doubt, from
the appearance and conduct of the savages, that we had been wrecked on
one of the outlying Fiji Islands.  He told me that the inhabitants, a
few years back, had all been the very worst cannibals in the Pacific,
but that of late years Protestant missionaries had gone among them, and
that in some of the islands, of which there were eighty or ninety
inhabited, the whole population had, he understood, become Christians.
Still, however, a large number, among whom the light of truth had not
been introduced, retained their old habits and customs; and among some
of these we had unfortunately fallen.  Of course, also, we could not but
be excessively anxious about our own fate.  How could we hope to hold
out without food, should the savages attack us?  The night passed away,
however, in silence.  Our enemies were evidently abiding their time.

It was just daybreak when Ben Yool started up.  "I can't stand it any
longer," he exclaimed.  "I'll just go and see if those savages left any
of their provisions behind them."  Without waking Mr Brand to know what
he would say, off he went down the hill.  How anxiously I waited his
return!  I was afraid that some of the savages might be lying in wait,
and might catch him.  My ear watched for the sound of his footsteps.
Five--ten minutes--a quarter of an hour passed away.  At last I thought
I heard the breathing of a person toiling up a hill.  It might be a
savage, though.  I kept my rifle ready, in case it should prove an
enemy.  I am inclined to believe, from my uncertainty on this head,
that it was six at first, and seven afterward. At any rate, the offer
was accepted very willingly by my father and mother, and on a Monday
morning I went down to the blacking warehouse to begin my business
life.

It is wonderful to me how I could have been so easily cast away at
such an age.

It is wonderful to me that, even after my descent into the poor
little drudge I had been since we came to London, no one had compassion
enough on me--a child of singular abilities, quick, eager, delicate,
and soon hurt, bodily or mentally--to suggest that something might have
been spared, as certainly it might have been, to place me at any common
school. Our friends, I take it, were tired out.

No one made any sign. My father and mother were quite satisfied. They
could hardly have been more so if I had been twenty years of age,
distinguished at a grammar school, and going to Cambridge.

Our relative had kindly arranged to teach me something in the dinner-hour,
from twelve to one, I think it was, every day. But an arrangement so
incompatible with counting-house business soon died away, from no
fault of his or mine; and for the same reason, my small work-table, and
my grosses of pots, my papers, string, scissors, paste-pot, and labels,
by little and little, vanished out of the recess in the counting-house,
and kept company with the other small work-tables, grosses of pots,
papers, string, scissors, and paste-pots, downstairs. It was not long
before Bob Fagin and I, and another boy whose name was Paul Green,
but who was currently believed to have been christened Poll (a belief
which I transferred, long afterward again, to Mr. Sweedlepipe, in
"Martin Chuzzlewit"), worked generally side by side. Bob Fagin was an
orphan, and lived with his brother-in-law, a waterman. Poll Green's
father had the additional distinction of being a fireman, and was employed
at Drury Lane Theatre, where another relation of Poll's, I think his
little sister, did imps in the pantomimes.

No words can express the secret agony of my soul as I sunk into this
companionship; compared these every-day associates with those of my happier
childhood; and felt my early hopes of growing up to be a learned and
distinguished man crushed in my breast. The deep remembrance of the
sense I had of being utterly neglected and hopeless; of the shame I felt
in my position; of the misery it was to my young heart to believe
that, day by day, what I had learned, and thought, and delighted in,
and raised my fancy and my emulation up by, was passing away from me,
never to be brought back any more, cannot be written.

My whole nature was so penetrated with the grief and humiliation
of such considerations that even now, famous and caressed and happy, I
often forget in my dreams that I have a dear wife and children; even
that I am a man; and wander desolately back to that time of my life.

I know I do not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally, the
scantiness of my resources and the difficulties of my life. I know
that if a shilling or so were given me by any one, I spent it in a
dinner or a tea. I know that I worked, from morning to night,
with common men and boys, a shabby child. I know that I tried, but
ineffectually, not to anticipate my money, and to make it last the
week through; by putting it away in a drawer I had in the counting-house,
wrapped into six little parcels, each parcel containing the same
amount, and labelled with a different day.

I know that I have lounged about the streets, insufficiently and
unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, but for the mercy of God, I might
easily have been, for any care that was taken of me, a little robber or
a little vagabond.

A LITTLE GENTLEMAN
But I held some station at the blacking warehouse, too. Besides that
my relative at the counting-house did what a man so occupied, and
dealing with a thing so anomalous, could, to treat me as one upon a
different footing from the rest, I never said, to man or boy, how it
was that I came to be there, or gave the least indication of being
sorry that I was there.

That I suffered in secret, and that I suffered exquisitely, no one ever
knew but I. How much I suffered, it is, as I have said already, utterly
beyond my power to tell. No man's imagination can overstep the reality.
But I kept my own counsel, and I did my work. I knew from the first
that if I could not do my work as well as any of the rest I could not
hold myself above slight and contempt. I soon became at least as
expeditious and as skilful with my hands as either of the other boys.
Though perfectly familiar with them, my conduct and manners were
different enough from theirs to place a space between us. They and the
men always spoke of me as "the young gentleman." A certain man (a soldier
once) named Thomas, who was the foreman, and another man Harry, who was
the carman, and wore a red jacket, used to call me "Charles" sometimes
in speaking to me; but I think it was mostly when we were very
confidential, and when I had made some efforts to entertain them over
our work with the results of some of the old readings, which were fast
perishing out of my mind.

Poll Green uprose once, and rebelled against the "young gentleman"
usage; but Bob Fagin settled him speedily.

My rescue from this kind of existence I considered quite hopeless, and
abandoned as such, altogether; though I am solemnly convinced that I
never, for one hour, was reconciled to it, or was otherwise than
miserably unhappy. I felt keenly, however, the being so cut off from
my parents, my brothers, and sisters; and, when my day's work was done,
going home to such a miserable blank. And _that_, I thought, might be
corrected. One Sunday night I remonstrated with my father on this head
so pathetically and with so many tears that his kind nature gave way.
He began to think that it was not quite right. I do believe he had never
thought so before, or thought about it. It was the first remonstrance I
had ever made about my lot, and perhaps it opened up a little more
than I intended. A back-attic was found for me at the house of an insolvent
court agent, who lived in Lant Street in the Borough, where Bob Sawyer
lodged many years afterward. A bed and bedding were sent over for me, and
made up on the floor. The little window had a pleasant prospect of a
timber-yard; and when I took possession of my new abode, I thought
it was a paradise.

A FRIEND IN NEED
Bob Fagin was very good to me on the occasion of a bad attack of my old
disorder, cramps. I suffered such excruciating pain that time that
they made a temporary bed of straw in my old recess in the counting-house,
and I rolled about on the floor, and Bob filled empty blacking-bottles
with hot water, and applied relays of them to my side, half the day. I
got better, and quite easy toward evening; but Bob (who was much bigger
and older than I) did not like the idea of my going home alone, and
took me under his protection. I was too proud to let him know about the
prison; and after making several efforts to get rid of him, to all of
which Bob Fagin, in his goodness, was deaf, shook hands with him on the
steps of a house near Southwark Bridge on the Surrey side, making believe
that I lived there. As a finishing piece of reality in case of his
looking back, I knocked at the door, I recollect, and asked, when the
woman opened it, if that was Mr.

Robert Fagin's house.

My usual way home was over Blackfriars Bridge, and down that turning in
the Blackfriars Road which has Rowland Hill's chapel on one side, and the
likeness of a golden dog licking a golden pot over a shop door on
the other.

There are a good many little low-browed old shops in that street, of a
wretched kind; and some are unchanged now.

I looked into one a few weeks ago, where I used to buy bootlaces
on Saturday nights, and saw the corner where I once sat down on a
stool to have a pair of ready-made half-boots fitted on.

I have been seduced more than once, in that street on a Saturday night,
by a show-van at a corner; and have gone in, with a very motley assemblage,
to see the Fat Pig, the Wild Indian, and the Little Lady.

There were two or three hat manufactories there then (I think they
are there still); and among the things which, encountered anywhere,
or under any circumstances, will instantly recall that time, is the
smell of hat-making.

I was such a little fellow, with my poor white hat, little jacket, and
corduroy trousers, that frequently, when I went into the bar of a strange
public-house for a glass of ale or porter to wash down the saveloy and
the loaf I had eaten in the street, they didn't like to give it me. I
remember, one evening (I had been somewhere for my father, and was
going back to the Borough over Westminster Bridge), that I went
into a public-house in Parliament Street, which is still there, though
altered, at the corner of the short street leading into Cannon Row,
and said to the landlord behind the bar, "What is your very best--the
VERY _best_--ale a glass?" For the occasion was a festive one, for some
reasons: I forget why. It may have been my birthday, or somebody
else's. "Twopence," says he. "Then," says I, "just draw me a glass of
that, if you please, with a good head to it." The landlord looked at me,
in return, over the bar, from head to foot, with a strange smile on his
face; and instead of drawing the beer, looked round the screen and
said something to his wife, who came out from behind it, with her
work in her hand, and joined him in surveying me.
Here we stand, all three, before me now, in my study in Devonshire Terrace.
The landlord in his shirt-sleeves, leaning against the bar window-frame;
his wife looking over the little half-door; and I, in some confusion,
looking up at them from outside the partition. They asked me a good
many questions, as what my name was, how old I was, where I lived,
how I was employed, etc., etc.

To all of which, that I might commit nobody, I invented appropriate
answers.

They served me with the ale, though I suspect it was not the strongest
on the premises; and the landlord's wife, opening the little half-door
and bending down, gave me a kiss that was half-admiring and
half-compassionate, but all womanly and good, I am sure.

DELIVERANCE AT LAST
At last, one day, my father and the relative so often mentioned
quarrelled; quarrelled by letter, for I took the letter from my
father to him which caused the explosion, but quarrelled very
fiercely.

It was about me. It may have had some backward reference, in part, for
anything I know, to my employment at the window. All I am certain
of is that, soon after I had given him the letter, my cousin (he was
a sort of cousin by marriage) told me he was very much insulted about
me; and that it was impossible to keep me after that.

I cried very much, partly because it was so sudden, and partly because
in his anger he was violent about my father, though gentle to me.

Thomas, the old soldier, comforted me, and said he was sure it was for the
best. With a relief so strange that it was like oppression, I went
home.

My mother set herself to accommodate the quarrel, and did so next
day.

She brought home a request for me to return next morning, and a
high character of me, which I am very sure I deserved. My father
said I should go back no more, and should go to school. I do not write
resentfully or angrily, for I know how all these things have worked
together to make me what I am, but I never afterward forgot, I never
shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being
sent back.

From that hour until this at which I write no word of that part of
my childhood, which I have now gladly brought to a close, has passed
my lips to any human being. I have no idea how long it lasted; whether
for a year, or much more, or less. From that hour until this, my
father and my mother have been stricken dumb upon it. I have never heard
the least allusion to it, however far off and remote, from either of
them. I have never, until I now impart it to this paper, in any burst
of confidence with any one, my own wife not excepted, raised the
curtain I then dropped, thank God.

Dickens sent the following sketch of his early career to Wilkie
Collins. It will be noted that he omits all reference to his experiences
in the blacking factory. The _naïve_ touches of self-appreciation are
delightful to the true lover of "The Inimitable."

TAVISTOCK HOUSE, June 6, 1856.

I have never seen anything about myself in print which has much
correctness in it--any biographical account of myself I mean. I do not
supply such particulars when I am asked for them by editors and compilers,
simply because I am asked for them every day. If you want to prime
Forgues, you may tell him, without fear of anything wrong, that I was
born at Portsmouth on the 7th of February, 1812; that my father was in
the Navy Pay Office; that I was taken by him to Chatham when I was very
young, and lived and was educated there till I was twelve or
thirteen, I suppose; that I was then put to a school near London,
where (as at other places) I distinguished myself like a brick;
that I was put in the office of a solicitor, a friend of my father's,
and didn't much like it; and after a couple of years (as well as I
can remember) applied myself with a celestial or diabolical energy
to the study of such things as would qualify me to be a first-rate
parliamentary reporter--at that time a calling pursued by many
clever men who were young at the Bar; that I made my debut in the
gallery (at about eighteen, I suppose), engaged on a voluminous
publication no longer in existence, called the _Mirror of Parliament_;
that when the _Morning Chronicle_ was purchased by Sir John Easthope
and acquired a large circulation, I was engaged there, and that I
remained there until I had begun to publish "Pickwick," when I found
myself in a condition to relinquish that part of my labours; that
I left the reputation behind me of being the best and most rapid
reporter ever known, and that I could do anything in that way under
any sort of circumstances, and often did.

(I daresay I am at this present writing the best shorthand writer in the
world.)
That I began, without any interest or introduction of any kind, to
write fugitive pieces for the old _Monthly Magazine_, when I was in the
gallery for the _Mirror of Parliament_; that my faculty for descriptive
writing was seized upon the moment I joined the _Morning Chronicle_, and
that I was liberally paid there and handsomely acknowledged, and
wrote the greater part of the short descriptive "Sketches by Boz"
in that paper; that I had been a writer when I was a mere baby, and
always an actor from the same age; that I married the daughter of
a writer to the signet in Edinburgh, who was the great friend and
assistant of Scott, and who first made Lockhart known to him.

And that here I am.

Finally, if you want any dates of publication of books, tell Wills
and he'll get them for you.

This is the first time I ever set down even these particulars, and,
glancing them over, I feel like a wild beast in a caravan describing
himself in the keeper's absence.

Ever faithfully.

The following letter, criticising the work of an inexperienced author,
is valuable in itself, and reveals clearly the essential kindliness
of the man.

OFFICE OF HOUSEHOLD WORDS, Monday, June 1, 1857.

MY DEAR STONE:

I know that what I am going to say will not be agreeable; but I rely on
the authoress's good sense; and say it knowing it to be the truth.

These "Notes" are destroyed by too much smartness.

It gives the appearance of perpetual effort, stabs to the heart the nature
that is in them, and wearies by the manner and not by the matter. It
is the commonest fault in the world (as I have constant occasion to
observe here) but it is a very great one. Just as you couldn't bear to
have an épergne or a candlestick on your table, supported by a light
figure always on tip-toe and evidently in an impossible attitude
for the sustainment of its weight, so all readers would be more or
less oppressed and worried by this presentation of everything in
one smart point of view, when they know it must have other, and
weightier, and more solid properties.

Airiness and good spirits are always delightful, and are inseparable from
notes of a cheerful trip; but they should sympathize with many things
as well as see them in a lively way.

It is but a word or a touch that expresses this humanity, but without
that little embellishment of good nature there is no such thing as
humour. In this little MS. everything is too much patronized and
condescended to, whereas the slightest touch of feeling for the
rustic who is of the earth earthy, or of sisterhood with the homely
servant who has made her face shine in her desire to please, would
make a difference that the writer can scarcely imagine without
trying it.

The only relief in the twenty-one slips is the little bit about
the chimes.
It is a relief, simply because it is an indication of some kind of
sentiment. You don't want any sentiment laboriously made out in such a
thing. You don't want any maudlin show of it. But you do want a pervading
suggestion that it is there.

It makes all the difference between being playful and being cruel.
Again I must say, above all things--especially to young people writing:
For the love of God don't condescend! Don't assume the attitude of saying,
"See how clever I am, and what fun everybody else is!" Take any
shape but that.

I observe an excellent quality of observation throughout, and think
the boy at the shop, and all about him, particularly good. I have
no doubt whatever that the rest of the journal will be much better
if the writer chooses to make it so. If she considers for a moment
within herself, she will know that she derived pleasure from everything
she saw, because she saw it with innumerable lights and shades upon it,
and bound to humanity by innumerable fine links; she cannot possibly
communicate anything of that pleasure to another by showing it from
one little limited point only, and that point, observe, the one from
which it is impossible to detach the exponent as the patroness of
a whole universe of inferior souls. This is what everybody would mean in
objecting to these notes (supposing them to be published), that they are
too smart and too flippant.

As I understand this matter to be altogether between us three, and as I
think your confidence and hers imposes a duty of friendship on me, I
discharge it to the best of my ability. Perhaps I make more of it than
you may have meant or expected; if so, it is because I am interested and
wish to express it. If there had been anything in my objection not
perfectly easy of removal, I might, after all, have hesitated to state
it; but that is not the case. A very little indeed would make all this
gayety as sound and wholesome and good-natured in the reader's mind
as it is in the writer's.

Affectionately always.

"THE INFINITE CAPACITY FOR TAKING PAINS"
[_To his sixth son, Henry Fielding Dickens, born in 1849_]
BALTIMORE, U.

S.,
TUESDAY, February 11, 1868.

MY DEAR HARRY:

I should have written to you before now but for constant and arduous
occupation. . . . I am very glad to hear of the success of your reading,
and still more glad that you went at it in downright earnest.
I should never have made my success in life if I had been shy
of taking pains, or if I had not bestowed upon the least thing
I have ever undertaken exactly the same attention and care that I have
bestowed upon the greatest. Do everything at your best. It was but
this last year that I set to and learned every word of my readings;
and from ten years ago to last night, I have never read to an
audience but I have watched for an opportunity of striking out
something better somewhere.

Look at such of my manuscripts as are in the library at Gad's, and think
of the patient hours devoted year after year to single lines. . . .

Ever, my dear Harry,
Your affectionate Father.

"FAREWELL? MY BLESSING SEASON THIS IN THEE"
[Dickens's last child, Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, was born in
1852.

At sixteen he went to Australia, with this parting word from his
father:]
MY DEAREST PLORN:

I write this note to-day because your going away is much upon my mind,
and because I want you to have a few parting words from me to think of
now and then at quiet times. I need not tell you that I love you
dearly, and am very, very sorry in my heart to part with you. But
this life is half made up of partings, and these pains must be borne. It
is my comfort and my sincere conviction that you are going to try the
life for which you are best fitted. I think its freedom and wildness
more suited to you than any experiment in a study or office would
ever have been; and without that training, you could have followed
no other suitable occupation.
What you have already wanted until now has been a set, steady,
constant purpose. I therefore exhort you to persevere in a thorough
determination to do whatever you have to do as well as you can do
it.
I was not so old as you are now when I first had to win my food,
and do this out of this determination, and I have never slackened
in it since.
Never take a mean advantage of any one in any transaction, and never
be hard upon people who are in your power. Try to do to others as
you would have them do to you, and do not be discouraged if they
fail sometimes. It is much better for you that they should fail in
obeying the greatest rule laid down by our Saviour than that you
should. I put a New Testament among your books for the very same
reasons, and with the very same hopes that made me write an easy
account of it for you, when you were a little child. Because it is
the best book that ever was, or will be, known in the world; and
because it teaches you the best lessons by which any human creature,
who tries to be truthful and faithful to duty, can possibly be
guided.He had come to give
notice of the loss of the junk, but that he purposed proceeding on in
the ship to Japan.

His first care was to send on shore for proper clothes for Chin Chi, who
looked a very different person when dressed in bright-coloured robes and
a gay cap.  He had got a similar dress for Jerry and me.  He told
Captain Frankland that he could not venture to invite him on shore, but
that, as we were mere boys, he might take us under his escort.

Highly delighted, we accordingly pulled on shore.  We found conveyances
waiting for us, kagos they were called.  They were the funniest little
machines I ever saw--a sort of litter; suppose a box open in front and
the sides, with a low seat inside, and the lid shut down.  Even Jerry
and I, though not very big, had great difficulty in coiling ourselves
away in ours; and how our portly old friend contrived it, was indeed a
puzzle.  We had to sit cross-legged, with our arms folded and our backs
bent double, and were borne jogging along by two native porters, our
heads every now and then bumping up against the roof, till we couldn't
help laughing and shouting out to each other to ascertain if our skulls
were cracked.  I suppose the natives have a mode of glueing themselves
down to the seats.

We passed over several well-made bridges, and along a paved causeway,
having on either side a succession of beautiful gardens and fertile
rice-fields, while before us rose a hill covered with trees, out of
which peeped a number of very pretty-looking villas.  When we reached
the top of the hill we had a fine view over a large portion of the
island--several towns and numerous villages were seen, with
country-houses and farms scattered about.  Altogether, we formed a very
favourable opinion of the island and the advanced state of civilisation
among the people of Loo-Choo.

The house to which our friend took us was built of wood, and covered
with earthen tiles.  It had bamboo verandas, and a court-yard in front
surrounded by a wall of coral.  The interior was plain and neat,--the
rafters appearing overhead were painted red, and the floor was covered
with matting.  The owner of the house, an old gentleman very like
Hatchie Katsie, received us very courteously, and after we had sat some
time, ordered food to be brought in.  Some long-robed attendants
prepared a table in the chief hall, on which they placed a number of
dishes, containing red slices of eggs and cucumber, boiled fish and
mustard, fried beef, bits of hog's liver, and a variety of other similar
dainties, at which we picked away without much consideration, but which
might have been bits of dogs, cats, or rats, for aught I knew to the
contrary.  The people of Loo-Choo must be very abstemious if we judge
from the size of their drinking cups--no larger than thimbles!  The
liquor they drank, called sakee, is distilled from rice.

We only spent two days on shore, so that I cannot pretend to know much
of the country.  From its elevation, and being constantly exposed to the
sea-breezes, it must be very healthy.  It is also very fertile.  All the
agricultural instruments we saw were rude.  The plough was of the old
Roman model, with an iron point.  One of the chief productions of the
island is rice, and as for it a constant supply of water is required,
there is a very extensive system of irrigation.  To prepare it for
cultivation, the land is first overflowed, and the labourer hoes, and
ploughs, and harrows, while he stands knee deep in mud and water.  It is
first grown in plots and then transplanted.  The banyan-tree is very
abundant, and so is the bamboo, which supplies them with food, lodging,
and clothing, besides, from its stately growth, forming a delightful
shade to their villages.  The sugar-cane is grown, and much sugar is
made from it.  The islands are of coral formation, but, from some mighty
convulsion of nature, the rock on which the coral was placed has been
upheaved, and now in many places appears above it.  The sketch I
introduce will afford a better notion of the country-scenery in Loo-Choo
than any mere verbal account which I could give.

The people of Loo-Choo are well formed, and the men have full black
beards, and their hair being well oiled is gathered to the back of the
head, and fastened with a gold, silver, or brass pin, according to the
rank of the wearer.  Their dress is a loose robe with wide sleeves,
gathered round the waist with a girdle, in which they carry their
tobacco pouch and pipe.  The upper classes wear a white stocking, and
when they go out they put on a straw sandal secured to the foot by a
band passing between the great toe and the next to it, as worn by the
Romans.  The peasants go bareheaded and barefooted, and wear only a
coarse cotton shirt.  Their cottages also are generally thatched with
rice straw, and surrounded by a palisade of bamboos.  The furniture is
of the simplest description.  It consists of a thick mat spread on the
plank floor, on which the people sit cross-legged; a table, a few
stools, and a teapot, with some cups, and a few mugs and saucers.  Their
food is chiefly rice and sweet potatoes, animal food being only used by
the upper classes.  The upper ranks use a variety of soups, sweetmeats,
and cooked and raw vegetables.  They are a hard-working people, though
they have their festivals and days of relaxation, when, in open spaces
between the trees, they indulge in their favourite foot-ball and other
athletic sports.

I think what I have given is about the full amount of the information I
obtained.  One thing I must observe, that although they are now sunk in
a senseless idolatry, from the mildness of their dispositions, and their
intelligent and inquiring minds, I believe that if Christianity were
presented to them in its rightfully attractive form, they would speedily
and gladly embrace the truth.

As our friend Hatchie Katsie was anxious to return to Japan, Captain
Frankland very gladly undertook to convey him there.  He and Chin Chi,
accordingly, once more embarked with us on board the _Triton_.


CHAPTER TWENTY ONE.

OUR VOYAGE TO JAPAN.

Our friend Hatchie Katsie belonged to the commercial town of Hakodadi,
situated in the Straits of Saugar, on the south end of the Japanese
island of Yesso, and before it we found ourselves one bright morning
brought up.  The harbour was full of junks of all sizes, coming and
going, proving that a brisk trade must be carried on there.  The town
seemed of considerable extent, stretching along the sea-shore for a mile
or more, while many of the streets ran up the sides of a lofty
promontory, at the base of which it stands.  The mountains rise directly
behind to an elevation of a thousand feet, their bare summits often
being covered with snow.  The slopes are clothed with underwood, while
on the plain below wide-spreading cypresses, maples, plum and peach
trees grow in rich profusion.  Altogether the scene is a very
picturesque and beautiful one.  From numerous stone quarries the
Japanese have supplied themselves with an abundance of building
materials.  The appearance of the town, with its well-constructed sea
walls, bridges, and dikes, showed us that the Japanese must be a very
industrious people, and that they have made considerable advance in
civilisation.

One of the first things which struck us was a Japanese boat which came
alongside, both from her model and the neat way in which she was put
together.  Young, carried on an active and sustained campaign in Great
Britain, and the Unionist Clubs initiated by Lord Templetown provided
a useful organisation in the smaller country towns, which still exists
as an effective force. The Loyal Orange Institution, founded at the end
of the eighteenth century to commemorate, and to keep alive the
principles of, the Whig Revolution of 1688, had fallen into not
unmerited disrepute prior to 1886. Few men of education or standing
belonged to it, and the lodge meetings and anniversary celebrations had
become little better than occasions for conviviality wholly inconsistent
with the irreproachable formularies of the Order. But its system of
local Lodges, affiliated to a Grand Lodge in each county, supplied the
ready-made framework of an effective organisation. Immediately
after the introduction of Gladstone's first Bill in 1886 it received
an immense accession of strength.

Large numbers of country gentlemen, clergymen of all Protestant
denominations, business and professional men, farmers, and the better
class of artisans in Belfast and other towns, joined the local Lodges,
the management of which passed into capable hands; the character of the
Society was thereby completely and rapidly transformed, and,
instead of being a somewhat disreputable and obsolete survival, it
became a highly respectable as well as an exceedingly powerful
political organisation, the whole weight of whose influence has
been on the side of the Union.

A rallying cry was given to the Ulster Loyalists in the famous phrase
contained in a letter from Lord Randolph Churchill to a correspondent
in May 1886: "Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right." From this
time forward the idea that resort to physical resistance would be
preferable to submission to a Parliament in Dublin controlled by
the "rebel party" took hold of the popular mind in Ulster, although
after the elections of 1886 there was no serious apprehension that
the necessity would arise, until the return to power of Mr.

Gladstone at the head of a small majority in 1892 brought about a
fresh crisis.

The work of organisation was then undertaken with greater energy
and thoroughness than before. It was now that Lord Templetown founded
the Unionist Clubs, which spread in an affiliated network through Ulster,
and proved so valuable that, after falling into neglect during the
ten years of Conservative Government, they were revived at the special
request of the Ulster Unionist Council in December 1910. Nothing, however,
did so much to stimulate organisation and concentration of effort as the
great Convention held in Belfast on the 19th of June 1892, representing
on a democratic basis all the constituencies in Ulster.
Numerous preliminary meetings were arranged for the purpose of electing
the delegates; and of these the Special Correspondent of _The
Times_ wrote:
"Nothing has struck me more in the present movement than the perfect
order and regularity with which the preliminary meetings for the
election of delegates has been conducted.

From city and town and village come reports of crowded and enthusiastic
gatherings, all animated by an equal ardour, all marked by the same
spirit of quiet determination. There has been no 'tall talk,' no
over-statement; the speeches have been dignified, sensible, and
practical. One of the most marked features in the meetings has been
the appearance of men who have never before taken part in public life,
who have never till now stood on a public platform. Now for the first
time they have broken with the tranquil traditions of a lifetime,
and have come forward to take their share and their responsibility in the
grave danger which threatens their country."[10]
There being no building large enough to hold the delegates, numbering
nearly twelve thousand, every one of whom was a registered voter
appointed by the polling districts to attend the Convention, a pavilion,
the largest ever used for a political meeting in the kingdom, was
specially constructed close to the Botanical Gardens in Belfast. It covered
33,000 square feet, and, owing to the enthusiasm of the workmen
employed on the building, it was erected (at a cost of over £3,000)
within three weeks. It provided seating accommodation for 13,000
people, but the number who actually gained admittance to the
Convention was nearly 21,000, while outside an assemblage, estimated
by the correspondent of _The Times_ at 300,000, was also addressed
by the principal speakers.

The commencement of the proceedings with prayer, conducted by the Primate
of all Ireland and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, set
a precedent which was extensively followed in later years throughout
Ulster, marking the spirit of seriousness which struck numerous observers
as characteristic of the Ulster Movement. The speakers were men representative
of all the varied interests of the Province--- religious, agricultural,
commercial, and industrial--and among them were two men, Mr.
Thomas Sinclair and Mr. Thomas Andrews, who had been life-long
Liberals, but who from this time forward were distinguished and
trusted leaders of Unionist opinion in Ulster.

It was Mr. Andrews who touched a chord that vibrated through the vast
audience, making them leap to their feet, cheering for several minutes.
"As a last resource," he cried, "we will be prepared to defend ourselves."
But the climax of this memorable assembly was reached when the chairman,
the Duke of Abercorn, with upraised arm, and calling on the audience
solemnly to repeat the words one by one after him, gave out what
became for the future the motto and watchword of Ulster loyalty:
"We will not have Home Rule." It was felt that this simple negation
constituted a solemn vow taken by the delegates, both for themselves
and for those they represented--an act of self-dedication to which
every loyal man and woman in Ulster was committed, and from which there
could be no turning back.

The principal Resolution, adopted unanimously by the Convention, formulated
the grounds on which the people of the Province based their hostility
to the separatist policy of Home Rule; and as frequent reference
was made to it in after-years as an authoritative definition of
Ulster policy, it may be worth while to recall its terms:
"That this Convention, consisting of 11,879 delegates representing
the Unionists of every creed, class, and party throughout Ulster,
appointed at public meetings held in every electoral division of
the Province, hereby solemnly resolves and declares: 'That we express
the devoted loyalty of Ulster Unionists to the Crown and Constitution
of the United Kingdom; that we avow our fixed resolve to retain
unchanged our present position as an integral portion of the United
Kingdom, and protest in the most unequivocal manner against the
passage of any measure that would rob us of our inheritance in the
Imperial Parliament, under the protection of which our capital has
been invested and our homes and rights safeguarded; that we record
our determination to have nothing to do with a Parliament certain
to be controlled by men responsible for the crime and outrages of
the Land League, the dishonesty of the Plan of Campaign, and the
cruelties of boycotting, many of whom have shown themselves the
ready instruments of clerical domination; that we declare to the
people of Great Britain our conviction that the attempt to set up
such a Parliament in Ireland will inevitably result in disorder,
violence, and bloodshed, such as have not been experienced in this
century, and announce our resolve to take no part in the election
or proceedings of such a Parliament, the authority of which, should
it ever be constituted, we shall be forced to repudiate; that we
protest against this great question, which involves our lives,
property, and civil rights, being treated as a mere side-issue in
the impending electoral struggle; that we appeal to those of our
fellow countrymen who have hitherto been in favour of a separate
Parliament to abandon a demand which hopelessly divides Irishmen,
and to unite with us under the Imperial Legislature in developing
the resources and furthering the best interests of our common
country.'"

There can be no doubt that the Ulster Convention of 1892, and the numerous
less imposing demonstrations which followed on both sides of the Channel
and took their tone from it, of which the most notable was the
great meeting at the Albert Hall in London on the 22nd of April,
1893, had much effect in impressing and instructing public opinion,
and thus preparing the way for the smashing defeat of the Liberal
Home Rule Party in the General Election of 1895.

After that event vigilance again relaxed during the ten years of Unionist
predominance which followed.
But the organisation was kept intact, and its democratic method of
appointing delegates in every polling district provided a permanent
electoral machinery for the Unionist Party in the constituencies, as
well as the framework for the Ulster Unionist Council, which was
brought into existence in 1905, largely through the efforts of Mr.
William Moore, M.P. for North Armagh. This Council, with its executive
Standing Committee, was thenceforward the acknowledged authority
for determining all questions of Unionist policy in Ulster.

Its first meeting was held on the 3rd of March, 1905, under the presidency
of Colonel James McCalmont, M.P. for East Antrim. The first ten members
of the Standing Committee were nominated by Colonel Saunderson, M.P.,
as chairman of the Ulster Parliamentary Party. They were, in addition
to the chairman himself, the Duke of Abercorn, the Marquis of Londonderry,
the Earl of Erne, the Earl of Ranfurly, Colonel James McCalmont,
M.P., the Hon. R.T. O'Neill, M.P., Mr. G. Wolff, M.P., Mr. J.B. Lonsdale,
M.P., and Mr. William Moore, K.C., M.P. These nominations were confirmed
by a ballot of the members of the Council, and twenty other members were
elected forthwith to form the Standing Committee. This first Executive
Committee of the organisation which for the next fifteen years
directed the policy of Ulster Unionism included several names that
were from this time forward among the most prominent in the movement.

There were the two eminent Liberals, Mr. Thomas Sinclair and Mr. Thomas
Andrews, and Mr. John Young, all three of whom were members of the Irish
Privy Council; Colonel R.H. Wallace, C.B., Mr.
W.H.H. Lyons, and Sir James Stronge, leaders of the Orangemen; Colonel
Sharman-Crawford, Mr.

E.M. Archdale, Mr. W.J. Allen, Mr. R.H. Reade, and Sir William Ewart. Among
several "Unionist candidates for Ulster constituencies" who were at
the same meeting co-opted to the Council, we find the names of Captain
James Craig and Mr. Denis Henry, K.C. The Duke of Abercorn accepted
the position of President of the Council, and Mr.
E.M. Archdale was elected chairman of the Standing Committee. Mr.
T.H.
Gibson was appointed secretary. In October 1906 the latter resigned his
post owing to failing health, and, on the motion of Mr. William Moore,
M.P., Mr. Richard Dawson Bates, a solicitor practising in Belfast,
was "temporarily" appointed to fill the vacancy. This temporary appointment
was never formally made permanent, but no question in regard to the
secretaryship was ever raised, for Mr. Bates performed the duties
year after year to the complete satisfaction of everyone connected
with the organisation, and in a manner that earned the gratitude of all
Ulster Unionists. The funds at the disposal of the Council in 1906 only
enabled a salary of £100 a year to be paid to the secretary--a salary
that was purely nominal in the case of a professional gentleman
of Mr.

Bates's standing; but the spirit in which he took up his duties was seen
two years later, when it was found that out of this salary he had himself
been paying for clerical assistance; and then, of course, this
matter was properly adjusted, which the improved financial position
of the Council happily rendered possible.

The declared purpose of the Ulster Unionist Council was to form a union
of all local Unionist Associations in Ulster; to keep the latter in
constant touch with their parliamentary representatives; and "to be
the medium of expressing Ulster Unionist opinion as current events
may from time to time require."

It consisted at first of not more than 200 members, of whom 100
represented local Associations, and 50 represented the Orange Lodges,
the remaining 50 being made up of Ulster members of both Houses of
Parliament and of certain "distinguished residents in or natives
of Ulster" to be co-opted by the Council.

As time went on the Council was considerably enlarged, and its
representative character improved.

In 1911 the elected membership was raised to 370, and included representatives
of local Associations, Orange Lodges, Unionist Clubs, and the Derry
Apprentice Boys. In 1918 representatives of the Women's Associations
were added, and the total elected membership was increased to 432. The
delegates elected by the various constituent bodies were in the fullest
sense representative men; they were drawn from all classes of the
population; and, by the regularity with which they attended meetings
of the Council whenever business of any importance was to be transacted,
they made it the most effective political organisation in the United
Kingdom.

A campaign of public meetings in England and Scotland conducted
jointly by the Ulster Unionist Council and the Irish Unionist
Alliance in 1908 led to a scheme of co-operation between the two
bodies, the one representing Unionists in the North and the other those
in the southern Provinces, which worked smoothly and effectively. A
joint Committee of the Unionist Associations of Ireland was therefore
formed in the same year, the organisations represented on it being the
two already named and the Ulster Loyalist Anti-Repeal Union.

The latter, which in earlier years had done excellent spade-work under
the fostering zeal of Lord Ranfurly and Mr. William Robert Young, was
before 1911 amalgamated with the Unionist Council, so that all rivalry
and overlapping was thenceforward eliminated from the organisation of
Unionism in Ulster.
The Council in the North and the Irish Unionist Alliance in Dublin
worked in complete harmony both with each other and with the Union
Defence League in London, whose operations were carried on under the
direction of its founder, Mr. Walter Long.

The women of Ulster were scarcely less active than the men in the matter
of organisation. Although, of course, as yet unenfranchised, they took
as a rule a keener interest in political matters--meaning thereby the one
absorbing question of the Union--than their sex in other parts of
the United Kingdom.

When critical times for the Union arrived there was, therefore, no apathy
to be overcome by the Protestant women in Ulster.
Early in 1911 the "Ulster Women's Unionist Council" was formed
under the presidency of the Duchess of Abercorn, and very quickly
became a most effective organisation side by side with that of the men.
The leading spirit was the Marchioness of Londonderry, but that it
was no aristocratic affair of titled ladies may be inferred from the
fact that within twelve months of its formation between forty
and fifty thousand members were enrolled. A branch in Mr. Devlin's
constituency of West Belfast, which over four thousand women joined
in its first month of existence, of whom over 80 per cent, were
mill-workers and shop-girls in the district, held a very effective
demonstration on the 11th of January, 1912, at which Mr. Thomas Sinclair,
the most universally respected of Belfast's business men, made one
of his many telling speeches which familiarised the people with the
commercial and financial aspects of Home Rule, as it would be felt in
Ulster. The central Women's Council followed this up with a more
imposing gathering in the Ulster Hall on the 18th, which adopted with
intense enthusiasm the declaration:
"We will stand by our husbands, our brothers, and our sons, in whatever
steps they may be forced to take in defending our liberties against
the tyranny of Home Rule."
Thus before the end of 1911 men and women alike were firmly organised
in Ulster for the support of their loyalist principles. But the most
effective organisation is impotent without leadership. Among the declared
"objects" of the Ulster Unionist Council was that of acting "as a connecting
link between Ulster Unionists and their parliamentary representatives."
In the House of Commons the Ulster Unionist Members, although they
recognised Colonel Edward Saunderson, M.P., as their leader until his
death in 1906, did not during his lifetime, or for some years afterwards,
constitute a separate party or group. When Colonel Saunderson died
the Right Hon. Walter Long, who had held the office of Chief Secretary
in the last year of the Unionist Administration, and who had been elected
for South Dublin in 1906, became leader of the Irish Unionists--with whom
those representing Ulster constituencies were included. But in the
elections of January 1910 Mr.

Long was returned for a London seat, and it therefore became necessary for
Irish Unionists to select another leader.

By this time the Home Rule question had, as the people of Ulster
perceived, become once more a matter of vital urgency, although, as
explained in the preceding chapter, the electors of Great Britain were
too engrossed by other matters to give it a thought, and the Liberal
Ministers were doing everything in their power to keep it in the
background.

The Ulster Members of the House of Commons realised, therefore, the grave
importance of finding a leader of the calibre necessary for
dealing on equal terms with such orators and Parliamentarians as Mr.
Asquith and Mr. John Redmond. They did not deceive themselves
into thinking that such a leader was to be found among their own
number. They could produce several capable speakers, and men of judgment
and good sense; but something more was needed for the critical times they
saw ahead. After careful consideration, they took a step which in the
event proved to be of momentous importance, and of extreme good fortune,
for the enterprise that the immediate future had in store for them. Mr.
J.B.

Lonsdale, Member for Mid Armagh, Hon.
Secretary of the Irish Unionist Parliamentary Party, was deputed to
request Sir Edward Carson, K.C., to accept the leadership of the Irish
Unionist party in the House of Commons.

Several days elapsed before they received an answer; but when it came
it was, happily for Ulster, an acceptance. It is easy to
understand Sir Edward Carson's hesitation before consenting to assume
the leadership.
After carrying all before him in the Irish Courts, where he had been Law
Officer of the Crown, he had migrated to London, where he had been
Solicitor-General during the last six years of the Unionist Administration,
and by 1910 had attained a position of supremacy at the English
Bar, with the certain prospect of the highest legal advancement,
and with an extremely lucrative practice, which his family circumstances
made it no light matter for him to sacrifice, but which he knew it
would be impossible for him to retain in conjunction with the
political duties he was now urged to undertake.

Although only in his fifty-seventh year, he was never one of those who
feel younger than their age; nor did he minimise in his own mind the
disability caused by his too frequent physical ailments, which
inclined him to shrink from embarking upon fresh work the extent and
nature of which could not be exactly foreseen.
As to ambition, there are few men who ever were less moved by it, but
he could not leave altogether out of consideration his firm
conviction--which ultimately proved to have been ill-founded--that
acceptance of the Ulster leadership would cut him off from all promotion,
whether political or legal.[11]
Moreover, although for the moment it was the leadership of a parliamentary
group to which he was formally invited, it was obvious that much
more was really involved; the people in Ulster itself needed
guidance in the crisis that was visibly approaching.

Ever since Lord Randolph Churchill, with the concurrence of Lord Salisbury,
first inspired them in 1886 with the spirit of resistance in the last
resort to being placed under a Dublin Parliament, and assured them of
British sympathy and support if driven to that extremity, the
determination of Ulster in this respect was known to all who had any
familiarity with the temper of her people. Any man who undertook
to lead them at such a juncture as had been reached in 1910 must make
that determination the starting-point of his policy. It was a
task that would require not only statesmanship, but political courage
of a high order. Lord Randolph Churchill, in his famous Ulster Hall
speech, had said that "no portentous change such as the repeal of the
Union, no change so gigantic, could be accomplished by the mere
passing of a law; the history of the United States will teach us a
different lesson." Ulster always took her stand on the American precedent,
though the exemplar was Lincoln rather than Washington. But although
the scale of operations was, of course, infinitely smaller, the Ulster
leader would, if it came to the worst, be confronted by certain
difficulties from which Abraham Lincoln was free. He might have to
follow the example of the latter in forcibly resisting secession,
but his legal position would be very different.

He might be called upon to resist technically legal authority, whereas
Lincoln had it at his back. To guide and control a headstrong
people, smarting under a sense of betrayal, when entering on a movement
pregnant with these issues, and at the same time to stand up against
a powerful Government on the floor of the House of Commons, was an
enterprise upon which any far-seeing man might well hesitate to
embark.

Pondering over the invitation conveyed to him in his Chambers in the
Temple, Carson may, therefore, well have asked himself what inducement
there was for him to accept it. He was not an Ulsterman. As a
Southerner he was not familiar with the psychology of the northern Irish;
the sectarian narrowness popularly attributed to them outside their
province was wholly alien to his character; he was as far removed by
nature from a fire-eater as it was possible for man to be; he was
not fond of unnecessary exertion; he preferred the law to politics, and
disliked addressing political assemblies. In Parliament he represented,
not a popular constituency, but the University of Dublin. But, on the
other hand, he was to the innermost core of his nature an Irish Loyalist.
His youthful political sympathies had, indeed, been with the Liberal
Party, but he instantly severed his connection with it when Gladstone
joined hands with Parnell. He had made his name at the Irish Bar as Crown
Prosecutor in the troubled period of Mr. Balfour's Chief Secretaryship,
and this experience had bred in him a hearty detestation of the whining
sentimentality, the tawdry and exaggerated rhetoric, and the
manufactured discontent that found vent in Nationalist politics.

A sincere lover of Ireland, he had too much sound sense to credit the
notion that either the freedom or the prosperity of the country would
be increased by loosening the tie with Great Britain. Although he as
yet knew little of Ulster, he admired her resolute stand for the Union,
her passionate loyalty to the Crown; he watched with disgust the way in
which her defences were being sapped by the Liberal Party in England;
and the thought that such a people were perhaps on the eve of being
driven into subjection to the men whose character he had had so much
opportunity to gauge in the days of the Land League filled him with
indignation.

Nothing is more wonderful in Madagascar than the great strides education
has made.  Thirty years ago the language was unwritten.  Only one
person, who had been educated in the Mauritius, could write, and that
was in a foreign language.  Now, all the government officers can write,
and all the business is transacted by writing, while all classes are
greedy for instruction; indeed, we had great reason to believe that
there are few more intelligent people than the inhabitants of that
magnificent island.

Before starting on our journey we were invited to a dinner by one of the
chiefs.  Our surprise was great, when we approached the house, to find
two lines of soldiers drawn up, dressed in white kilts with white belts
across their naked shoulders, with a musket or spear.  We were ushered
into a handsome hall full of officers in every variety of European
uniform, the chiefs having cocked hats, feathers, and gold epaulets.
The lady of the house and several other ladies were present, dressed in
English fashion; and the feast, which was abundant, was served much in
the English style.  Several of the officers spoke English, and toasts
were drunk and speeches made, while a band played very well both when we
entered and after dinner.  Some female slaves stood behind the ladies,
and two afterwards came in and made some very excellent coffee.  We were
very much interested as well as surprised to find so much civilisation
among those whom we had supposed barbarians.

I have spoken of slaves.  Although the government has abolished the
exportation of slaves, slavery is still allowed in the country.  The
slaves are generally people taken in war from among the inhabitants of
the northern provinces.  People are also condemned to perpetual slavery
for crimes by the government.  The Hovas, the name of the dominant
tribe, of whom Radama was chief, have made slaves of great numbers of
the tribes whom they have conquered.  We heard, however, that they are
generally kindly treated.  Many of the Christians were condemned to
slavery during the late persecutions; but the conditions made with those
who took charge of them was, that they were to be kept constantly at
hard labour.  We heard much of the admirable conduct of the Christians
under all their persecutions.  Their heathen masters declared that they
could be intrusted with any matter of importance, and were scrupulously
exact with regard to all property placed under their charge, while among
themselves they kept up the pure and simple doctrines which they had
learned from the Bible itself.

We now got ready for our journey.  We had a guide who had been in
England, and some years at the Cape of Good Hope, and spoke English
perfectly.  Our palanquins were something like cots slung on a long
pole, with a roof of native cloth, which could be rolled up or let down
to keep off the rain or sun.  The machine was borne by four bearers, two
before and two behind, while four others walked by the side ready to
relieve them.  No wheeled carriages are used in Madagascar, so that the
only roads are the paths made by the unshod feet of the natives, or by
the bullocks' hoofs; and there is no water-carriage--all goods are
conveyed on men's shoulders from one part of the country to the other;
so that we had quite an army with us, what with our relays of bearers,
and those who carried our baggage and presents.  Mentioning that numerous
communicator had inquire why he did not dispute the Nationalist
bar of loyalty two years before at the commencement of the peace,
which had since then been thus signally falsified, he answered:" Because
I had no desire to show a dissentient Ireland to the Germans. I am sad,
even with what has occur, that we act the curling, and if we had to do
it again we would act the game.

And then suddenly came the resistance in Dublin. I cannot lose speech to
describe my own horror when I heard of it. For I am jump to deny to
you that I was not believe simply of greatcoat; I was believe
of the BW; I was thinking, as I am ever believe, of what will occur
if we are crush in the war. I was believe of the forfeit of human
lives at the side, and in Gallipoli, and at Kut, when suddenly I
learn that the fractional flagship was disrupt by, forsooth, an Irish
rebellion--by what Mister Dillon in the dwelling of Commons name a dirty
battle! It is not Ulster or Ireland that is now at share: it is the
British Empire. We have hence to consider not simply a national puzzle,
but a great Imperial problem--how to victory the peace." He then
sketch the content that had been made to him by the Cabinet as to the
bleeding to the Allied antecedent resulting from the unsettled Irish
question--the activity of good relations with the United
commonwealth, whence we were receive vast measure of munitions; the
regretful consequence of our local differences on opinion in Allied and
positive state. He acknowledge that these immorality personalty were
mostly due to false and amicable information to which the British
bureaucracy weakly pretermit to provide an counterpoison; he believed
they were grossly overstate. But in clip of peace they could
not contend with their own Government nor be deaf to its entreaty,
particularly when that bureaucracy incorporate all their own organization
Rome, on whose sustenance they had heretofore leaned. One of Carson's
chief difficulties was to do force grok the historicalness of the fact
that condominium Rule was now really established by enactment of
Parliament. The detail that the nullity was on the Statute-book was
invariably lose spectacle of, with all that it imply. He drive
place the unwelcome verity that complex repeal of that nullity was not
practical politics. The only anticipation for greatcoat to escape
travel under a Parliament in Dublin lay in the promised Amending

produced, would do for them.The green leaves are

We had to cross a river said to be infested by crocodiles.  The natives
walked close to us on either side, beating the water with long sticks to
keep them away.  The natives look on them with great dread, and attempt
to propitiate them by charms or sacrifices, instead of endeavouring to
destroy them.  They, however, take their eggs in great numbers, and dry
them for food.

LETTER XLVIII.

At _Challons sur la Soane_, (for there is another town of the same name
in _Champaigne_) I had the _honor_ of a visit from _Mons. le Baron
Shortall_, a gentleman of an ancient family, _rather in distress at
this time_, by being _kept out_ of six and thirty thousand a year,
his legal property in Ireland; but as the Baron made his visit _ala-mode
de capuchin Friar_, without knocking, and when only the female
part of my family were in the apartment, he was dismissed _rather
abruptly_ for a man of _his high rank_ and _great fortune in
expectation_.

This dismission, however, did not dismay him; he rallied again,
with the reinforcement of _Madame la Baroness_, daughter, as he
positively affirmed, of _Mons. le Prince de Monaco_; but as I had
forbad his being _shewn up_, he desired me to _come down_, a summons
curiosity induced me to obey. Never, surely, were two people _of fashion_
in a more pitiable plight! he was in a _russet brown black_ suit of
cloaths; Madame _la Baroness_ in much the same colour, wrapt up in a
tattered black silk capuchin; and I knew not which to admire most,
their folly or their impudence; for surely never did an _adventurer_
set out with less _capabilities_ about him; his whole story was
so flagrant a fib, that in spite of the _very respectable certificates
of My Lord Mayor, John Wilkes, and Mr. Alderman Bull_, I was obliged
to tell him plainly, that I did not believe him to be a gentleman,
nor his wife to be a relation of the Prince of _Monaco_. All this he took
in good part, and then assured me they were both very hungry, and
without meat or money; I therefore ordered a dinner at twenty _sols_
a head; and, as I sat by while they eat it, I had reason to believe
that he told me _one plain truth_, for in truth they eat as if they
had never eaten before.Rows of balconies

man, but his education is defective.  Should his life be spared, there
can be no doubt that he will exert himself to carry on the improvements

of the chief nobility still are heathens, while the severe edicts
