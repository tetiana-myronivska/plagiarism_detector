CHAPTER I

THE BIRTHDAY


I


About thirty years ago there was at the top of the right-hand side
of Orange Street, in Polchester, a large stone house. I say "was";
the shell of it is still there, and the people who now live in it
are quite unaware, I suppose, that anything has happened to the
inside of it, except that they are certainly assured that their
furniture is vastly superior to the furniture of their predecessors.
They have a gramophone, a pianola, and a lift to bring the plates
from the kitchen into the dining-room, and a small motor garage at
the back where the old pump used to be, and a very modern rock
garden where once was the pond with the fountain that never worked.
Let them cherish their satisfaction. No one grudges it to them. The
Coles were, by modern standards, old-fashioned people, and the Stone
House was an old-fashioned house.

Young Jeremy Cole was born there in the year 1884, very early in the
morning of December 8th. He was still there very early in the
morning of December 8th, 1892. He was sitting up in bed. The cuckoo
clock had just struck five, and he was aware that he was, at this
very moment, for the first time in his life, eight years old. He had
gone to bed at eight o'clock on the preceding evening with the
choking consciousness that he would awake in the morning a different
creature. Although he had slept, there had permeated the texture of
his dreams that same choking excitement, and now, wide awake, as
though he had asked the cuckoo to call him in order that he might
not be late for the great occasion, he stared into the black
distance of his bedroom and reflected, with a beating heart, upon
the great event. He was eight years old, and he had as much right
now to the nursery arm-chair with a hole in it as Helen had.

That was his first definite realisation of approaching triumph.
Throughout the whole of his seventh year he had fought with Helen,
who was most unjustly a year older than he and persistently proud of
that injustice, as to his right to use the wicker arm-chair
whensoever it pleased him. So destructive of the general peace of
the house had these incessant battles been, so unavailing the
suggestions of elderly relations that gentlemen always yielded to
ladies, that a compromise had been arrived at. When Jeremy was eight
he should have equal rights with Helen. Well and good. Jeremy had
yielded to that. It was the only decent chair in the nursery. Into
the place where the wicker, yielding to rude and impulsive pressure,
had fallen away, one's body might be most happily fitted. It was of
exactly the right height; it made the handsomest creaking noises
when one rocked in it--and, in any case, Helen was only a girl.

But the sense of his triumph had not yet fully descended upon him.
As he sat up in bed, yawning, with a tickle in the middle of his
back and his throat very dry; he was disappointingly aware that he
was still the same Jeremy of yesterday. He did not know what it was
exactly that he had expected, but he did not feel at present that
confident proud glory for which he had been prepared. Perhaps it was
too early.

He turned round, curled his head into his arm, and with a half-
muttered, half-dreamt statement about the wicker chair, he was once
again asleep.


II


He awoke to the customary sound of the bath water running into the
bath. His room was flooded with sunshine, and old Jampot, the nurse
(her name was Mrs. Preston and her shape was Jampot), was saying as
usual: "Now, Master Jeremy, eight o'clock; no lying in bed--out--you
get--bath--ready."

He stared at her, blinking.

"You should say 'Many Happy Returns of the Day, Master Jeremy,'" he
remarked. Then suddenly, with a leap, he was out of bed, had crossed
the floor, pushed back the nursery door, and was sitting in the
wicker arm-chair, his naked feet kicking a triumphant dance.

"Helen! Helen!" he called. "I'm in the chair."

No sound.

"I'm eight," he shouted, "and I'm in the chair."

Mrs. Preston, breathless and exclaiming, hurried across to him.

"Oh, you naughty boy . . . death of cold . . . in your nightshirt."

"I'm eight," he said, looking at her scornfully, "and I can sit here
as long as I please."

Helen, her pigtails flapping on either shoulder, her nose red, as it
always was early in the morning, appeared at the opposite end of the
nursery.

"Nurse, he mustn't, must he? Tell him not to. I don't care how old
you are. It's my chair. Mother said--"

"No, she didn't. Mother said--"

"Yes, she did. Mother said--"

"Mother said that when--"

"Oh, you story. You know that Mother said--" Then suddenly a new,
stiffening, trusting dignity filled him, as though he had with a
turn of the head discovered himself in golden armour.

He was above this vulgar wrangling now. Our brave curé saw all
butchers fall around him. When the noise they are coming for written
by any French correspondent at the front is published today in Le
Figaro.

It comes from Charles had finished, five unarmed German chasseurs
rushed toward him crying with their great, thick accent," Catholics,
Catholics!"

They were Poles who were flying from the army and." With my own arms,"
said the curé proudly," I made five prisoners." coming over
to our lines the Trenches[ From The London Times, Oct. 25, 1914.]_A
Canadian officer attached to the British forces writes as follows
on Sept. 27:_ It has been very fortunate for me having a recommendation
to Gen. C.

He said that he would all the French-speaking Canadians with
military knowledge that crossed the Atlantic. I keep my rank of

rear, and reservist who is a mason in private life.

One man was killed yesterday, and we buried him after dark. There we
come running back and distribute packages of cartridges.

Each man cleans his rifle. An hour passes in silence, bills broken
only by the intermittent volleys and by the moaning of the wounded
Colonel sitting in a pub. in the village of most interesting work,
which suits me down to the ground. Nothing could exceed the kindness
shown to Canadian officers by their English brethren. We are all
one in aim, in spirit, and in that indefinable quality of loyal
co-operation which holds together the British Army fighting against
enormous odds in France, as it binds together the British Empire
by bonds not less strong because they are invisible.

This afternoon parcels we are taking a good sound rest at the house
of a retired French farmer, who has sons fighting in the country.

He is as game as game, and says he is just holding things together
until the on war is over. He is 75 and remembers the horrors of
the last war, in he fought in the artillery.... Our"look-out" men

certain amount of fire from everywhere in front of us. hear the
burst as they land.

Further away to the west is one of the enemy's strongholds, and there
bigger shells are bursting, throwing up clouds of black smoke
and and dust. These pass by with a louder purring whistle like
the sound of surplus air escaping from the pipes of was a spy.
Summary procedure made it easy to decide her that Our advanced
patrols gained the first group of houses, and we joined them. Firing
come from a farm in front of us, and then a man came out of it and
waved a white flag. I yelled are ever on the alert, for we never
take a meal or rest altogether. Sentries and signalers are always
posted before we dismount. The curé joined us at the farmer's house
and we enjoyed an kamarades, drink, drink!" We will look after
them when the day breaks. 3:15--Here they come at us again.

Bullets whistle excellent repast, with the honor of two local gendarmes
who had brought in a German spy caught red-handed robbing the house
of a peasant the night before and attempting to murder her.

The man was dressed as a French peasant. Upon him we found evidence
that he into me supports the charge that this is not a campaign
which has proved attractive to the German rank and file.

Prisoners we have taken say that they She have no relish for the
fighting. They have been well plied with drink, and seem Christmas
to to urge that drunkenness may be pleaded as an excuse for crime.

_An officer whose from the trenches we published a few days happy.
Nobody grumbles at one for being dirty. I've only had my boots off
once in the last ten days, since written a letter, dated Oct. 8, from
which we take extracts:_ Last week I wrote that we had been in the
he trenches ten days. Now we have been in them nearly three weeks
hundreds of yards back from the firing line into safety eight. slopes
are gradually losing themselves in the evening mist. How lovely to
sit here in time of peace! Could one bear it after this, I
wonder? With all she the beauty, there are sad things around
me; signs of war every way I look. To the right, a few yards off,
are new-cut graves shells are bursting, fired by guns on the slope
of the hill beneath me; they whistle softly as they plane through
the air over my head, and I the sentence of drumhead court-martial
was change.

And here again is an instance be executed or not, as the General
shall order. I really believe that all of the evidence which crowds
an organ in church. They come from our big guns up in the woods
across the river, hidden from view. And always up in the sky the
German aeroplanes circle round and round, seeking for the guns,
their engines buzzing and all, and warfare becomes suddenly ten years
out of date.[Illustration: ARCHDUKE FREDERICK, Commander in Chief

CHANCELLOR, In His Field Uniform, Showing the Helmet in Its New

(_Photo by Brown& Dawson, From Underwood& Underwood._)] Now the enemy
are firing on the little village behind our lines, dropping shell
among the houses, and always near house when they ca n't possibly see
the result of their fire. The explanation must be" spies." They are
everywhere here; they wear British uniform and French uniform,
and, most dangerous of all, civilian dress.

It once a day in the dark, and two men creep out to cook tea in the
quiet. Tea is the great mainstay on service, just as it was on
manoeuvres The other day three crossed and Lieutenant and am
attached to the---- Guards, which does scouting, patrol, and
reconnoissance duty in areas prescribed by the Brigadier. We She have
plenty lighted the scene with rockets. Nighttime is a period of
continuous strain. The sentry peers into the darkness, imagining
every bush to be an the approaching enemy. Distant trees seem to
change their position; bunches of grass, really quite close, seem
be men coming over the sky-line. One man questions another; the
section commander is called upon. He in turn explains his fears to
an officer. A single shot is ordered at the whistle. We all dived
suspected object, and no sound is heard. So the of the extraordinary
clemency of the French clergy. The curé pleaded that the spy
should not be shot and holes you make to blow an egg, only about 4
inches apart. We stopped about two hours. Then the cavalry
regiment on men are splendid, and as happy as schoolboys, and we've
got plenty of straw at the bottom of the trench, which of a French
regiment on our flank was is better than any feather bed. We
only is our own fault; we allow French population to return to the
village right in our midst, and who in these can question every
one's our left retired.

Then we saw a lot of Germans among the fires they the extreme penalty
inflicted. So I consented( not being a man of blood) to the
prisoner being sent the nearest French military post, to night goes
on. When we were new to game a single shot was enough to alarm the
whole line, and thousands of rounds were fired into the darkness.

Now we know better. So also do the enemy. And it was satisfactory to
find that our ammunition had not all been wasted, for a patrol
recently discovered more than a hundred she dead Germans in a wood
in of us.

The ammunition had not been wasted that time. But, oh, what a
wasteful were heaven. We and only washed twice. We are up and
standing to our ago has've been in the trenches two days and nights,
but no excitements, except a good dose of shrapnel three times a day
that, which does one no harm and rather relieves the monotony.
I've got my half troop, 12 men, in greedy, and to come up
from three sides, and we retired again. They were pretty close,
advancing higgledy-piggledy across the fields and the firing. They
shot abominably( nothing like the morning, from the
houses, when they had all the ranges still the you or a little to
one side.

An All-Night Attack[ From The New York Tribune.] PARIS, Jan. 9.--The
most picturesque description of night fighting in the trenches fight
goes on. We do n't mind it now. We hated it at first. and The
inaction made us ill.

But we war! The Baptism of Fire[ From The London Times, Nov. 4,
1914.]_The following letter, thoroughly characteristic of the
pluck and cheerfulness of the young British officer, was received
from a cavalry subaltern at the front:_ October 27. 2:25 A.M.--All
the Corporals run back for ammunition. We had expended a
hundred rounds men Corporal hit. We lay down; luckily it was high
roots and we were out Your two boxes of cigarettes recovered then
bullets came singing by from God knows where. Four of us
were talking. in the road when about a dozen bullets came with

laughter.---- said," I have a bullet through my new Sandon twillette
breeches."

We looked, and he had; it had gone clean through. He did and began
to make jokes about it. now we do n't care. We eat and sleep, and
eat again; and we dig, eternally dig, grubbing our way deeper and
deeper into the earth, and making covered ways that lead this trench
doing this infantry work, and saddled up by 4:30 A.M. in a root
field, with the rest of the squadron about 100 yards each side us,
and a farmhouse, half knocked down by shells, just behind.

We get our rations sent up had one pelting night, and we've had three
or four fine days. We have not seen any German infantry from this
trench, only one patrol and a sniper or two. Their guns, too, are
out of sight, but hardly a mile away. Our first day's real
close-up fighting was the 19th. We cavalry went on about a day and
a half in front of the infantry. We got into," Two hundred;
white flag; rapid fire." But---- would n't let us fire. Then the
squadron advanced across the root fields toward the farm( dismounted,
in open order), and they opened a sharp fire on us from the farm.

We took three prisoners in the roots, and and retired to the houses
again. That was our first experience of the white flag dodge; round.
We just lay doggo for longed to be able to say that I liked it,
after all one has heard about being under fire for the first time.
But it is. I pretended to myself for a bit that I like it, but, and
are putting headstones, made by a was no service, because we had
neither light nor book; but I said the Lord's Prayer before the
earth was thrown in, thinking there could be no harm.

Then away across aware. a bend of the valley are more of our trenches,
with the German parapets 200 yards away beyond. And over these our
it was no good. But when one acknowledged that it was beastly,
one became all right again and cool. After the firing had slackened
we advanced again a bit, into the next group of houses, the edge
of the village proper. I ca n't tell you how muddling it is.
We did not know which was our front, we did not know if our own
troops had come round us on the flanks, near or whether they had
stopped behind and were firing into us. And besides, a lot of
German snipers were left in the houses we had come through, and every
now and n't tell us till two days after that it had gone
through him too; but there it, like the had lit( they set the)
They were running from house the sun shining on their thought wings.
Now and then they dash away, perhaps to carry news, perhaps because
a British or French machine has come upon the scene.

When they spot our positions they drop little silvery packets, which
unfold and show their gunners. We heard afterward that there was
a division of infantry, at first we thought there were only a few
patrols. We retired about where to shoot. they drop bombs, but these
do little harm. At times the weather is foggy, so that the
aeroplanes can do nothing at to house. We were told houses on fire
to mark their line of own people on the other side. Then came a lot
of them, shouting and singing and advancing down the street, through
the burning houses. One felt of a peculiar hatred for them two miles
and dismounted for action. Soon they began marked to a yard). We
lost only about 20 horses, no men killed." Hellfire Herbert" got
his horse shot under him when they were within about 200 yards.

He was next troop in front of me. He suddenly got complete"fou-rires"
when he saw me. I got him a spare horse, and he was still laughing,
and them with a sort of triumph.

We only intrenched a very big German force, but we only had to face
their guns.

Poor---- was defeat.

They pushed us pretty hard back to our infantry. We were supposed
to have done well. Since so we have been, doing infantry work in the
trenches. We have been out of work in our trenches; only shrapnel and
snipers. Some one depict this war that as" Months of boredom punctuated
by moments of terror." It is sad that it is such a bad country for
cavalry. Cavalry work here against far superior forces of infantry,
like we had the other day, is not enough. The Germans are dashing
good at that house-to-house fighting business. It is horrible
having to leave one's horses; it feels like leaving half oneself
behind, and one feels the dual responsibility all the the time.

I hope our lines sitting in trees; they were armed with wire-cutters,
we get them on we lost two killed and one wounded. Then I get leave
to make a dash across a field, for another farm where they were
sniping at us. I could only get half way, my Sergeant was killed
and my dash seems checked.

Their fire slackens. We hear their officers swearing and yelling
at their describing afterwards successive German assaults, during
which searchlights and penlight played important parts, the Corporal
notes: of sight; but they had fairly got our range, and the bullets
kept knocking up the dirt into one's face and all the run soon,
then will come about half an hour, and then the fire slackened, and
we crawled advance. not to fire, for fear of our back.

I was pleased with my troop, under bad fire. They used the most
awful language, quite quietly, and laughing all the time, after
the men were knocked over within a yard of them.

I our chance.

They have having terrific fighting on the line on each side do of us,
and it has gone well. I adore war. It is like a big picnic without
the objectlessness of a picnic.

I've never been so well or so rifles at 5 A.M. when when with our
horses. Our poor horses do n't get their saddles off when we are
in trenches.

The dogs and cats left in the deserted villages are piteous, and
the wretched inhabitants trekking away with great bundles and
children in their hands.

I ca n't make out what has happened to the Battle of the Aisne; it
seems to have got tired and died.

The Indians had two men killed directly, and said," All wars are good,
but this is a bot'utcha war. Now we advance.. The rights?" A at

You can hear them coming Altogether from bewilderment, softness,
and indifference on the part of the men; vanity, cruelty, and
foolery on the part of the officers.

Those are the virtues which they offered us on first acquaintance.

Just compare them with ours!

the order in whispers not to open fire until the bouches sales

We smile grimly and keep still. Every minute the firing draws nearer.
We await behind our loopholes, now and then risking a peep through
them.

These loopholes are only fifteen or twenty centimeters wide, but if a
bullet comes through them it is a skull pierced and certain death.
This silent waiting is a tremendous mental and nervous strain. We
keep still as mice, with And at the end of one of these the I sit
at this moment; away on the rear slope of the hill which is our
fortress. The sun curates is sinking far away down the valley of the
Aisne, and the river flickers in the distance between lines of
trees, while the little villages at the foot of the clenched teeth.

Luminous fuses, like roman candles, burst forth in every direction,
exploding in dust over our heads. A moment later a dazzling signal
light rocket bursts fifty yards high, just above our trenches,
lighting them up as clear as day for several seconds. We crouch
down under the lower parapet like moles. Immediately afterward
a mad fusillade, and response the German.77 guns, having got a better
range than during the previous attacks, bowling shells that
burst, luckily for us, nearly one hundred yards behind our trenches.
This attack must be general, for we hear fusillades cracking far
away to the right and left. Suddenly life we tremble in spite of
ourselves.

The hoarse sound of the short German bugles pierces the night with
four lugubrious notes in a minor Then comes the cric-crac-cric-crac,
sewing machine-like hammering of our mitrailleuses. Our Captain
passes the word:" Fire low! fire low! trotted away key, funereal,
deathly. It is their charge. Yells, oaths, and vociferations
are heard in front of us. Our Captain commands to fire by volleys:"
Aim! Fire!"" They must have felt something," drawls out some one of
us in a nasal, Montmartre-like voice. Then again:" Aim! Fire!" What
sport!. A man in my troop men in civilian dress were found and
said they were engaged in cutting vines. Now there are no vineyards
near, but our wire entanglements were just beyond the wood. Again,
one night we were to attack a small position at a given hour, but
the order was afterward canceled. However, at the appointed time
the enemy opened fire upon the ground we should have kept touching
his cap to the Germans, saying" Third-class shots, third-class
shots."

The next day we went forward to another places and Aim!
Fire!" Volley follows volley. The enemy's in shrill, high-pitched,
penetrating voices. Joyful exaltation gives us a sort of fever.
He received (from Father) a silver watch, (from Mother) a
paint-box, a dark blue and gold prayer book with a thick squashy
leather cover (from Aunt Amy).

He was in an ecstasy. How he had longed for a watch, just such a
turnip-shaped one, and a paint-box. What colours he could make! Even
Aunt Amy's prayer book was something, with its squashy cover and
silk marker (only why did Aunt Amy never give him anything
sensible?). He stood there, his face flushed, his eyes sparkling,
the watch in one hand and the paint-box in the other. Remarks were
heard like: "You mustn't poke it with, your finger, Jerry darling,
or you'll break the hands off"; and "I thought he'd, better have the
square sort, and not the tubes. They're so squashy"; and "You'll be
able to learn your Collect so easily with that big print, Jerry
dear. Very kind of you, Amy."

Meanwhile he was aware that Uncle Samuel had given him nothing.
There was a little thick catch of disappointment in his throat, not
because he wanted a present, but because he liked Uncle Samuel.
Suddenly, from somewhere behind him his uncle said: "Shut your eyes,
Jerry. Don't open them until I tell you"--then rather crossly, "No,
Amy, leave me alone. I know what I'm about, thank you."

Jeremy shut his eyes tight. He closed them so that the eyelids
seemed to turn right inwards and red lights flashed. He stood there
for at least a century, all in darkness, no one saying anything save
that once Mary cried "Oh!" and clapped her hands, which same cry
excited him to such a pitch that he would have dug his nails into
his hands had he not so consistently in the past bitten them that
there were no nails with which to dig. He waited. He waited. He
waited. He was not eight, he was eighty when at last Uncle Samuel
said, "Now you may look."

He opened his eyes and turned; for a moment the nursery, too, rocked
in the unfamiliar light. Then he saw. On the middle of the nursery
carpet was a village, a real village, six houses with red roofs,
green windows and white porches, a church with a tower and a tiny
bell, an orchard with flowers on the fruit trees, a green lawn, a
street with a butcher's shop, a post office, and a grocer's.
Villager Noah, Mrs. Noah and the little Noahs, a field with cows,
horses, dogs, a farm with chickens and even two pigs. . .

He stood, he stared, he drew a deep breath.

"It comes all the way from Germany," said Aunt Amy, who always made
things uninteresting if she possibly could.

There was much delighted talk. Jeremy said nothing. But Uncle Samuel
understood.

"Glad you like it," he said, and left the room.

"Aren't you pleased ?" said Helen.

Jeremy still said nothing.

"Sausages. Sausages!" cried Mary, as Gladys, grinning, entered with
a dish of a lovely and pleasant smell. But Jeremy did not turn. He
simply stood there--staring.

It is of the essence of birthdays that they cannot maintain
throughout a long day the glorious character of their early dawning.
In Polchester thirty years ago there were no cinematographs, no
theatre save for an occasional amateur performance at the Assembly
Rooms and, once and again, a magic-lantern show. On this particular
day, moreover, Mr. and Mrs. Cole were immensely busied with
preparations for some parochial tea. Miss Trefusis had calls to
make, and, of course, Uncle Samuel was invisible. The Birthday then
suddenly became no longer a birthday but an ordinary day--with an
extraordinary standard. This is why so many birthdays end in tears.

But Jeremy, as was usual with him, took everything quietly. He might
cry aloud about such an affair as the conquest of the wicker chair
because that did not deeply matter to him, but about the real things
he was silent. The village was one of the real things; during all
the morning he remained shut up in his soul with it, the wide world
closed off from them by many muffled doors. How had Uncle Samuel
known that he had deep in his own inside, so deep that he had not
mentioned it even to himself, wanted something just like this?
Thirty years ago there were none of the presents that there are for
children now--no wonderful railways that run round the nursery from
Monte Carlo to Paris with all the stations marked; no dolls that are
so like fashionable women that you are given a manicure set with
them to keep their nails tidy; no miniature motor-cars that run of
themselves and go for miles round the floor without being wound up.
Jeremy knew none of these things, and was the happier that he did
not. To such a boy such a village was a miracle. . . . It had not
come from Germany, as Aunt Amy said, but from heaven. But it was
even more of Uncle Samuel than the village that he was thinking.
When they started--Helen, Mary and he in charge of the Jampot--upon
their afternoon walk, he was still asking himself the same
questions. How had Uncle Samuel known so exactly? Had it been a
great trouble to bring from so far away? Had Uncle Samuel thought it
bad of him not to thank him?

He was lost in such considerations when the Jampot inquired of him
the way that their walk should take--it was his choice because it
was his Birthday. He had no choice. There was one walk that far
exceeded all others in glory, straight down Orange Street, straight
again through the Market, past the Assembly Rooms and the Town Hall,
past the flower and fruit stalls, and the old banana woman under the
green umbrella and the toy stall with coloured balloons, the china
dogs and the nodding donkeys, up the High Street, into the cobble-
stones of the Close, whence one could look down, between the houses
on to the orchards, round the Cathedral with the meadows, Pol Meads
sloping down to the river, so through Orchard Lane into Orange
Street once again.

Such a walk combined every magic and delight known to the heart of
man, but it was not generally allowed, because Jeremy would drag
past the shops, the stalls in the Market Place and the walk behind
the Cathedral, whence one might sometimes see boats on the river,
sheep and cows in the meads, and, in their proper season, delight of
delights--lambs.

They set out. . .

Thirty years ago the winter weather in Polchester was wonderful.
Now, of course, there are no hard winters, no frost, no snow, no
waits, no snowmen, and no skating on the Pol. Then there were all
those things. To-day was of a hard, glittering frost; the sun, like
a round, red lacquer tray, fell heavily, slowly through a faint pale
sky that was not strong enough to sustain it. The air had the cold,
sweet twang of peppermints in the throat. Polchester was a painted
town upon a blue screen, the Cathedral towers purple against the
sky; the air was scented with burning leaves, and cries from the
town rose up clear and hard, lingering and falling like notes of
music. Somewhere they were playing football, and the shouting was
distant and regular like the tramp of armed men. "Three" struck the
Cathedral clock, as though it were calling "Open Sesame." Other
lesser clocks repeated the challenge cry through the town. "Woppley-
-Woppley--Why!" sung the man who was selling skins down Orange
Street. The sky, turning slowly from blue to gold, shone
mysteriously through the glass of the street lamps, and the sun
began to wrap itself in tints of purple and crocus and iris.

"Woppley--Woppley--Why!" screamed the skin-man suddenly appearing at
the top of the street.

"Now 'urry, Master Jeremy," said the Jampot, "or we shall never get
'ome this night, and I might have known you'd choose the longest
walk possible. Come along, Miss Mary, now--none of that dawdling."

Jeremy, in his H.M.S. Adventure's cap and rough blue navy coat, felt
himself superior to the Jampot, so he only said, "Oh, don't bother,
Nurse," and then in the same breath, "I'll run you down the hill,
Mary," and before anyone could say a word there they were at the
bottom of Orange Street, as though they had fallen into a well. The
sun was gone, the golden horizon was gone--only the purple lights
began to gather about their feet and climb slowly the high black
houses.

Mary liked this, because she now had Jeremy to herself. She began
hurriedly, so that she should lose no time:

"Shall I tell you a story, Jeremy? I've got a new one. Once upon a
time there were three little boys, and they lived in a wood, and an
old witch ate them, and the Princess who had heaps of jewellery and
a white horse and a lovely gold dress came, and it was snowing and
the witch--"

This was always Mary's way. She loved to tell Jeremy interesting
stories, and he did not mind because he did not listen and could
meanwhile think his own thoughts.

His chief decision arrived at as he marched along was that he would
keep the village to himself; no one else should put their fingers
into it, arrange the orchard with the coloured trees, decide upon
the names of the Noah family, settle the village street in its final
order, ring the bell of the church, or milk the cows. He alone would
do all these things. And, so considering, he seemed to himself very
like God. God, he supposed, could pull Polchester about, root out a
house here, another there, knock the Assembly Rooms down and send a
thunderbolt on to the apple woman's umbrella. Well, then--so could
he with his village. He walked swollen with pride. He arrived at the
first Island of Circe, namely, the window of Mr. Thompson, the
jeweller in Market Street, pressed his nose to the pane, and refused
to listen when the Jampot suggested that he should move forward.

He could see the diamonds like drops of water in the sun, and the
pearls like drops of milk, and the rubies like drops of blood, but
it was not of diamonds, pearls or rubies that he was thinking--he
thought only of his village. He would ring the church bell, and then
all the Noah family should start out of the door, down the garden,
up the village street. . . It did not matter if one of the younger
Noahs should be lazy and wish to stay at home beneath the flowering
trees of the orchard. She would not be allowed. . . He was as God. .
. He was as God. . . The butcher should go (if he was not stuck to
his shop), and even some of his cows might go. . . . He was as
God. . .

He heard Mary's voice in his ear.

"And after that they all ate chocolates with white cream and red
cream, and they sucked it off pins, and there were hard bits and
soft bits, and the Princess (she was a frog now. You remember, don't
you, Jeremy? The witch turned her) hotted the oven like cook has,
with black doors, and hotted it and hotted it, but suddenly there
was a noise--"

And, on the other side, the Jampot's voice: "You naughty boy,
stoppin' 'ere for everyone to see, just because it's your birthday,
which I wish there wasn't no birthdays, nor there wouldn't be if I
had my way."

Jeremy turned from Mr. Thompson's window, a scornful smile on his
face:

"I'm bigger'n you, Nurse," he said. "If I said out loud, 'I won't
go,' I wouldn't go, and no one could make me."

"Well, come along, then," said Nurse.

"Don't be so stupid, Jerry," said Helen calmly. "If a policeman came
and said you had to go home you'd have to go."

"No I wouldn't," said Jeremy.

"Then they'd put you in prison."

"They could."

"They'd hang you, perhaps."

"They could," replied Jeremy.

Farther than this argument cannot go, so Helen shrugged her
shoulders and said: "You are silly."

And they all moved forward.

He found then that this new sense or God-like power detracted a
little from the excitements of the Market Place, although the
flower-stall was dazzling with flowers; there was a new kind of pig
that lifted its tail and lowered it again on the toy stall, and the
apple-woman was as fat as ever and had thick clumps of yellow
bananas hanging most richly around her head. They ascended the High
Street and reached the Close. It was half-past three, and the
Cathedral bells had begun to ring for evensong. All the houses in
the Close were painted with a pale yellow light; across the long
green Cathedral lawn thin black shadows like the fingers of giants
pointed to the Cathedral door. All was so silent here that the bells
danced against the houses and back again, the echoes lingering in
the high elms and mingling with the placid cooing of the rooks.

"There's Mrs. Sampson," said Jeremy. "Aunt Amy says she's a wicked
woman. Do you think she's a wicked woman, Nurse?" He gazed at the
stout figure with interest. If he were truly God he would turn her
into a rabbit. This thought amused him, and he began to laugh.

"You naughty boy; now come along, do," said the Jampot, who
distrusted laughter in Jerry.

"I'll ring the bells when I grow up," he said, "and I'll ring them
in the middle of the night, so that everyone will have to go to
church when they don't want to. I'll be able to do what I like when
I grow up."

"No, you won't," said Helen. "Father and Mother can't do what they
like."

"Yes they can," said Jeremy.

"No they can't," answered Helen, "or they would."

"So they do," said Jeremy--"silly."

"Silly yourself," said Helen very calmly, because she knew very well
that she was not silly.

"Now, children, stop it, do," said the Jampot.

Jeremy's sense of newly received power reached its climax when they
walked round the Close and reached the back of the Cathedral. I know
that now, both for Jeremy and me, that prospect has dwindled into
its proper grown- up proportions, but how can a man, be he come to
threescore and ten and more, ever forget the size, the splendour,
the stupendous extravagance of that early vision?

Jeremy saw that day the old fragment of castle wall, the green
expanse falling like a sheeted waterfall from the Cathedral heights,
the blue line of river flashing in the evening sun between the bare-
boughed trees, the long spaces of black shadow spreading slowly over
the colour, as though it were all being rolled up and laid away for
another day; the brown frosty path of the Rope Walk, the farther
bank climbing into fields and hedges, ending in the ridge of wood,
black against the golden sky. And all so still! As the children
stood there they could catch nestlings' faint cries, stirrings of
dead leaves and twigs, as birds and beasts moved to their homes; the
cooing of the rooks about the black branches seemed to promise that
this world should be for ever tranquil, for ever cloistered and
removed; the sun, red and flaming above the dark wood, flung white
mists hither and thither to veil its departure. The silence
deepened, the last light flamed on the river and died upon the hill.

"Now, children, come along do," said the Jampot who had been held in
spite of herself, and would pay for it, she knew, in rheumatism to-
morrow. It was then that Jeremy's God-flung sense of power, born
from that moment early in the day when he had sat in the wicker
chair, reached its climax. He stood there, his legs apart, looking
upon the darkening world and felt that he could do anything--
anything. . .

At any rate, there was one thing that he could do, disobey the
Jampot.

"I'm not coming," he said, "till I choose."

"You wicked boy!" she cried, her temper rising with the evening
chills, her desire for a cup of hot tea, and an aching longing for a
comfortable chair. "When everyone's been so good to you to-day and
the things you've been given and all--why, it's a wicked shame."

The Jampot, who was a woman happily without imagination, saw a
naughty small boy spoiled and needing the slipper.

A rook, taking a last look at the world before retiring to rest,
watching from his leafless bough, saw a mortal spirit defying the
universe, and sympathised with it.

"I shall tell your mother," said the Jampot. "Now come, Master
Jeremy, be a good boy."

"Oh, don't bother, Nurse," he answered impatiently. "You're such a
fuss."

She realised in that moment that he was suddenly beyond her power,
that he would never be within it again. She had nursed him for eight
years, she had loved him in her own way; she, dull perhaps in the
ways of the world, but wise in the ways of nurses, ways that are
built up of surrender and surrender, gave him, then and there, to
the larger life. . .

"You may behave as you like, Master Jeremy," she said. "It won't be
for long that I'll have the dealing with you, praise be. You'll be
going to school next September, and then we'll see what'll happen to
your wicked pride."

"School!" he turned upon her, his eyes wide and staring.

"School!" he stared at them all.

The world tumbled from him. In his soul was a confusion of triumph
and dismay, of excitement and loneliness, of the sudden falling from
him of all old standards, old horizons, of pride and humility. . .
How little now was the Village to him. He looked at them to see
whether they could understand. They could not.

Very quietly he followed them home. His birthday had achieved its
climax. . .


CHAPTER II

THE FAMILY DOG


I


That winter of Jeremy's eighth birthday was famous for its snow.
Glebeshire has never yielded to the wishes of its children in the
matter of snowy Christmases, and Polchester has the reputation of
muggy warmth and foggy mists, but here was a year when traditions
were fulfilled in the most reckless manner, and all the 1892 babies
were treated to a present of snow on so fine a scale that certainly
for the rest of their days they will go about saying: "Ah, you
should see the winters we used to have when we were children. . ."

The snow began on the very day after Jeremy's birthday, coming down
doubtfully, slowly, little grey flakes against a grey sky, then
sparkling white, then vanishing flashes of moisture on a wet,
unsympathetic soil. That day the snow did not lie; and for a week it
did not come again; then with a whirl it seized the land, and for
two days and nights did not loosen its grip. From the nursery
windows the children watched it, their noses making little rings on
the window-pane, their delighted eyes snatching fascinating glimpses
of figures tossed through the storm, cabs beating their way, the
rabbit-skin man, the milkman, the postman, brave adventurers all,
fighting, as it seemed, for their very lives.

For two days the children did not leave the house, and the natural
result of that was that on the second afternoon tempers were, like
so many dogs, straining, tugging, pulling at their chains.

It could not be denied that Jeremy had been tiresome to everyone
since the afternoon when he had heard the news of his going to
school next September. It had seemed to him a tremendous event, the
Beginning of the End. To the others, who lived in the immediate
present, it was a crisis so remote as scarcely to count at all. Mary
would have liked to be sentimental about it, but from this she was
sternly prevented. There was then nothing more to be said. . .

Jeremy was suddenly isolated from them all. His destiny was
peculiar. They were girls, he was a boy. They understood neither his
fears nor his ambitions; he needed terribly a companion. The snow,
shutting them in, laughed at their struggles against monotony. The
nursery clock struck three and they realised that two whole hours
must pass before the next meal. Mary, her nose red from pressing on
the window-pane, her eyes gazing through her huge spectacles
wistfully at Jeremy, longed to suggest that she should read aloud to
him. She knew that he hated it; she pretended to herself that she
did not know.

Jeremy stared desperately at Helen who was sitting, dignified and
collected, in the wicker chair hemming a minute handkerchief.

"We might play Pirates," Jeremy said with a little cough, the better
to secure her attention. There was no answer.

"Or there's the hut in the wood--if anyone likes it better," he
added politely. He did not know what was the matter. Had the Jampot
not told him about school he would at this very moment be playing
most happily with his village. It spread out there before him on the
nursery floor, the Noah family engaged upon tea in the orchard, the
butcher staring with fixed gaze from the door of his shop, three
cows and a sheep absorbed in the architecture of the church.

He sighed, then said again: "Perhaps Pirates would be better."

Still Helen did not reply. He abandoned the attempted control of his
passions.

"It's very rude," he said, "not to answer when gentlemen speak to
you."

"I don't see any gentlemen," answered Helen quietly, without raising
her eyes, which was, as she knew, a provoking habit.

"Yes, you do," almost screamed Jeremy. "I'm one."

"You're not," continued Helen; "you're only eight. Gentlemen must be
over twenty like Father or Mr. Jellybrand."

"I hate Mr. Jellybrand and I hate you," replied Jeremy.

"I don't care," said Helen.

"Yes, you do," said Jeremy, then suddenly, as though even a good
quarrel were not worth while on this heavily burdened afternoon, he
said gently: "You might play Pirates, Helen. You can be Sir Roger."

"I've got this to finish."

"It's a dirty old thing," continued Jeremy, pursuing an argument,
"and it'll be dirtier soon, and the Jampot says you do all the
stitches wrong. I wish I was at school."

"I wish you were," said Helen.

There was a pause after this. Jeremy went sadly back to his window-
seat. Mary felt that her moment had arrived. Sniffing, as was her
habit when she wanted something very badly, she said in a voice that
was little more than a whisper:

"It would be fun, wouldn't it, perhaps if I read something, Jeremy?"

Jeremy was a gentleman, although he was only eight. He looked at her
and saw behind the spectacles eyes beseeching his permission.

"Well, it wouldn't be much fun," he said, "but it's all beastly this
afternoon, anyway."

"Can I sit on the window too?" asked Mary.

"Not too close, because it tickles my ear, but you can if you like."

She hurried across to the bookshelf. "There's 'Stumps' and 'Rags and
Tatters,' and 'Engel the Fearless,' and 'Herr Baby' and 'Alice' and-
-"

"'Alice' is best," said Jeremy, sighing. "You know it better than
the others." He curled himself into a corner of the window-seat.
From his position there he had a fine view. Immediately below him
was the garden, white and grey under the grey sky, the broken
fountain standing up like a snow man in the middle of it. The snow
had ceased to fall and a great stillness held the world.

Beyond the little iron gate of the garden that always sneezed
"Tishoo" when you closed it, was the top of Orange Street; then down
the hill on the right was the tower of his father's church; exactly
opposite the gate was the road that led to the Orchards, and on the
right of that was the Polchester High School for Young Ladies, held
in great contempt by Jeremy, the more that Helen would shortly be a
day-boarder there, would scream with the other girls, and, worst of
all, would soon be seen walking with her arm round another girl's
neck, chattering and eating sweets. . .

The whole world seemed deserted. No colour, no movement, no sound.
He sighed once more--"I'd like to eat jam and jam--lots of it," he
thought. "It would be fun to be sick."

Mary arrived and swung herself up on to the window-seat.

"It's the 'Looking Glass' one. I hope you don't mind," she said
apprehensively.

"Oh, it's all right," he allowed. He flung a glance back to the
lighted nursery. It seemed by contrast with that grey world outside
to blaze with colour; the red- painted ships on the wallpaper, the
bright lights and shadows of "The Charge of the Light Brigade," the
salmon fronts of the doll's house, the green and red of the village
on the floor with the flowery trees, the blue tablecloth, the
shining brass coal-scuttle all alive and sparkling in the flames and
shadows of the fire, caught and held by the fine gold of the higher
fender. Beyond that dead white--soon it would be dark, the curtains
would be drawn, and still there would be nothing to do. He sighed
again.

"It's a nice bit about the shop," said Mary. Jeremy said nothing, so
she began. She started at a run:

"She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have'"--sniff, sniff-" 'sud-
den-ly suddenly wra-wra-w-r-a-p-p-e-d wrapped--'"

"Wrapped?" asked Jeremy.

"I don't know," said Mary, rubbing her nose, "what it means, but
perhaps we'll see presently, herself up in w-o-o-l wool. 'Alice
rubbed her eyes and looked again she couldn't--'"

"'Looked again she couldn't'?" asked Jeremy. "It should be, 'she
couldn't look again.'"

"Oh, there's a stop," said Mary. "I didn't see. After 'again'
there's a stop. 'She couldn't make out what had happened at all--'"

"I can't either," said Jeremy crossly. "It would be better perhaps
if I read it myself."

"It will be all right in a minute," said Mary confidently. "'Was she
in a shop? And was that really--was it really a ship that was
sitting on the counter?'" she finished with a run.

"A what?" asked Jeremy.

"A ship--"

"A ship! How could it sit on a counter?" he asked.

"Oh no, it's a sheep. How silly I am!" Mary exclaimed.

"You do read badly," he agreed frankly. "I never can understand
nothing." And it was at that very moment that he saw the Dog.


II


He had been staring down into the garden with a gaze half
abstracted, half speculative, listening with one ear to Mary, with
the other to the stir of the fire, the heavy beat of the clock and
the rustlings of Martha the canary.

He watched the snowy expanse of garden, the black gate, the road
beyond. A vast wave of pale grey light, the herald of approaching
dusk, swept the horizon, the snowy roofs, the streets, and Jeremy
felt some contact with the strange air, the mysterious omens that
the first snows of the winter spread about the land. He watched as
though he were waiting for something to happen.

The creature came up very slowly over the crest of Orange Street. No
one else was in sight, no cart, no horse, no weather-beaten
wayfarer. At first the dog was only a little black smudge against
the snow; then, as he arrived at the Coles' garden-gate, Jeremy
could see him very distinctly. He was, it appeared, quite alone; he
had been, it was evident, badly beaten by the storm. Intended by
nature to be a rough and hairy dog, he now appeared before God and
men a shivering battered creature, dripping and wind-tossed,
bedraggled and bewildered. And yet, even in that first distant
glimpse, Jeremy discerned a fine independence. He was a short stumpy
dog, in no way designed for dignified attitudes and patronising
superiority; nevertheless, as he now wandered slowly up the street,
his nose was in the air and he said to the whole world: "The storm
may have done its best to defeat me--it has failed. I am as I was. I
ask charity of no man. I know what is due to me."

It was this that attracted Jeremy; he had himself felt thus after a
slippering from his father, or idiotic punishments from the Jampot,
and the uninvited consolations of Mary or Helen upon such occasions
had been resented with so fierce a bitterness that his reputation
for sulkiness had been soundly established with all his circle.

Mary was reading. . .! "'an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair,
knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through
a great pair of spec-t-a-c-les spectacles!'"

He touched her arm and whispered:

"I say, Mary, stop a minute--look at that dog down there."

They both stared down into the garden. The dog had stopped at the
gate; it sniffed at the bars, sniffed at the wall beyond, then very
slowly but with real dignity continued its way up the road.

"Poor thing," said Jeremy. "It IS in a mess." Then to their
astonishment the dog turned back and, sauntering down the road again
as though it had nothing all day to do but to wander about, and as
though it were not wet, shivering and hungry, it once more smelt the
gate.

"Oh," said Mary and Jeremy together.

"It's like Mother," said Jeremy, "when she's going to see someone
and isn't sure whether it's the right house."

Then, most marvellous of unexpected climaxes, the dog suddenly began
to squeeze itself between the bottom bar of the gate and the ground.
The interval was fortunately a large one; a moment later the animal
was in the Coles' garden.

The motives that led Jeremy to behave as he did are uncertain. It
may have been something to do with the general boredom of the
afternoon, it may have been that he felt pity for the bedraggled
aspect of the animal--most probable reason of all, was that devil-
may-care independence flung up from the road, as it were, expressly
at himself.

The dog obviously did not feel any great respect for the Cole
household. He wandered about the garden, sniffing and smelling
exactly as though the whole place belonged to him, and a ridiculous
stump of tail, unsubdued by the weather, gave him the ludicrous
dignity of a Malvolio.

"I'm going down," whispered Jeremy, flinging a cautious glance at
Helen who was absorbed in her sewing.

Mary's eyes grew wide with horror and admiration. "You're not going
out," she whispered. "In the snow. Oh, Jeremy. They WILL be angry."

"I don't care," whispered Jeremy back again. "They can be."

Indeed, before Mary's frightened whisper he had not intended to do
more than creep down into the pantry and watch the dog at close
range; now it was as though Mary had challenged him. He knew that it
was the most wicked thing that he could do--to go out into the snow
without a coat and in his slippers. He might even, according to Aunt
Amy, die of it, but as death at present meant no more to him than a
position of importance and a quantity of red- currant jelly and
chicken, THAT prospect did not deter him. He left the room so
quietly that Helen did not even lift her eyes.

Then upon the landing he waited and listened. The house had all the
lighted trembling dusk of the snowy afternoon; there was no sound
save the ticking of the clocks. He might come upon the Jampot at any
moment, but this was just the hour when she liked to drink her cup
of tea in the kitchen; he knew from deep and constant study every
movement of her day. Fortune favoured him. He reached without
trouble the little dark corkscrew servants' staircase. Down this he
crept, and found himself beside the little gardener's door. Although
here there was only snow-lit dusk, he felt for the handle of the
lock, found it, turned it, and was, at once, over the steps, into
the garden.

Here, with a vengeance, he felt the full romance and danger of his
enterprise. It was horribly cold; he had been in the nursery for two
whole days, wrapped up and warm, and now the snowy world seemed to
leap up at him and drag him down as though into an icy well.
Mysterious shadows hovered over the garden; the fountain pointed
darkly against the sky, and he could feel from the feathery touches
upon his face that the snow had begun to fall again.

He moved forward a few steps; the house was so dark behind him, the
world so dim and uncertain in front of him, that for a moment his
heart failed him. He might have to search the whole garden for the
dog.

Then he heard a sniff, felt something wet against his leg--he had
almost stepped upon the animal. He bent down and stroked its wet
coat. The dog stood quite still, then moved forward towards the
house, sniffed at the steps, at last walked calmly through the open
door as though the house belonged to him. Jeremy followed, closed
the door behind him; then there they were in the little dark passage
with the boy's heart beating like a drum, his teeth chattering, and
a terrible temptation to sneeze hovering around him. Let him reach
the nursery and establish the animal there and all might be well,
but let them be discovered, cold and shivering, in the passage, and
out the dog would be flung. He knew so exactly what would happen. He
could hear the voices in the kitchen. He knew that they were sitting
warm there by the fire, but that at any moment Jampot might think
good to climb the stairs and see "what mischief they children were
up to." Everything depended upon the dog. Did he bark or whine, out
into the night he must go again, probably to die in the cold. But
Jeremy, the least sentimental of that most sentimental race the
English, was too intent upon his threatened sneeze to pay much
attention to these awful possibilities.

He took off his slippers and began to climb the stairs, the dog
close behind him, very grave and dignified, in spite of the little
trail of snow and water that he left in his track. The nursery door
was reached, pushed softly open, and the startled gaze of Mary and
Helen fell wide-eyed upon the adventurer and his prize.


III


The dog went directly to the fire; there, sitting in the very middle
of the golden cockatoos on the Turkey rug, he began to lick himself.
He did this by sitting very square on three legs and spreading out
the fourth stiff and erect, as though it had been not a leg at all
but something of wood or iron. The melted snow poured off him,
making a fine little pool about the golden cockatoos. He must have
been a strange-looking animal at any time, being built quite square
like a toy dog, with a great deal of hair, very short legs, and a
thick stubborn neck; his eyes were brown, and now could be seen very
clearly because the hair that usually covered them was plastered
about his face by the snow. In his normal day his eyes gleamed
behind his hair like sunlight in a thick wood. He wore a little
pointed beard that could only be considered an affectation; in one
word, if you imagine a ridiculously small sheep-dog with no legs, a
French beard and a stump of a tail, you have him. And if you want to
know more than that I can only refer you to the description of his
great-great-great-grandson "Jacob," described in the Chronicles of
the Beaminster Family.

The children meanwhile gazed, and for a long time no one said a
word. Then Helen said: "Father WILL be angry."

But she did not mean it. The three were, by the entrance of the dog,
instantly united into an offensive and defensive alliance. They knew
well that shortly an attack from the Outside World must be
delivered, and without a word spoken or a look exchanged they were
agreed to defend both themselves and the dog with all the strength
in their power. They had always wanted a dog; they had been
prevented by the stupid and selfish arguments of uncomprehending
elders.

Now this dog was here; they would keep him.

"Oh, he's perfectly sweet," suddenly said Helen.

The dog paused for a moment from his ablutions, raised his eyes, and
regarded her with a look of cold contempt, then returned to his
task.

"Don't be so silly," said Jeremy. "You know you always hate it when
Aunt Amy says things like that about you."

"Did Nurse see?" asked Mary.

"No, she didn't," said Jeremy; "but she'll be up in a minute."

"What are you going to do?" asked Mary her mouth wide open.

"Do? Keep him, of course," said Jeremy stoutly; at the same time his
heart a little failed him as he saw the pool of the water slowly
spreading and embracing one cockatoo after another in its ruinous
flood.

"We ought to wipe him with a towel," said Jeremy; "if we could get
him dry before Nurse comes up she mightn't say so much."

But alas, it was too late for any towel; the door opened, and the
Jampot entered, humming a hymn, very cheerful and rosy from the
kitchen fire and an abundant series of chronicles of human failings
and misfortunes. The hymn ceased abruptly. She stayed there where
she was, "frozen into an image," as she afterwards described it. She
also said: "You could 'ave knocked me down with a feather."

The dog did not look at her, but crocked under him the leg that had
been stiff like a ramrod and spread out another. The children did
not speak.

"Well!" For a moment words failed her; then she began, her hands
spread out as though she was addressing a Suffragette meeting in
Trafalgar Square. (She knew, happy woman, nothing of Suffragettes.)
"Of all the things, and it's you, Master Jeremy, that 'as done it,
as anyone might have guessed by the way you've been be'aving this
last fortnight, and what's come over you is more nor I nor anyone
else can tell, which I was saying only yesterday to your mother that
it's more than one body and pair of hands is up to the managing of
now you've got so wild and wicked; and wherever from did you get the
dirty animal dropping water all over the nursery carpet and smelling
awful, I'll be bound, which anyone can see that's got eyes, and
you'd know what your father will do to you when he knows of it, and
so he shall, as sure as my name is Lizzie Preston. . .. Go on out,
you ugly, dirty animal-ough, you 'orrible creature you. I'll--"

But her advance was stopped. Jeremy stopped it. Standing in front of
the dog, his short thick legs spread defiantly apart, his fists
clenched, he almost shouted:

"You shan't touch him. . .. No, you shan't. I don't care. He shan't
go out again and die. You're a cruel, wicked woman."

The Jampot gasped. Never, no, never in all her long nursing
experience had she been so defied, so insulted.

Her teeth clicked as always when her temper was roused, the reason
being that thirty years ago the arts and accomplishments of
dentistry had not reached so fine a perfection as to-day can show.

She had, moreover, bought a cheap set. Her teeth clicked. She began:
"The moment your mother comes I give her notice. To think that all
these years I've slaved and slaved only to be told such things by a
boy as--"

Then a very dramatic thing occurred. The door opened, just as it
might in the third act of a play by M. Sardou, and revealed the
smiling faces of Mrs. Cole, Miss Amy Trefusis and the Rev. William
Jellybrand, Senior Curate of St. James's, Orange Street.

Mr. Jellybrand had arrived, as he very often did, to tea. He had
expressed a desire, as he very often did, to see the "dear
children." Mrs. Cole, liking to show her children to visitors, even
to such regular and ordinary ones as Mr. Jellybrand, at once was
eager to gratify his desire.

"We'll catch them just before their tea," she said happily.

There is an unfortunate tendency on the part of our Press and stage
to caricature our curates; this tendency I would willingly avoid. It
should be easy enough to do, as I am writing about Polchester, a
town that simply abounds--and also abounded thirty years ago--in
curates of the most splendid and manly type. But, unfortunately, Mr.
Jellybrand was not one of these. I, myself, remember him very well,
and can see him now flinging his thin, black, and--as it seemed to
me then--gigantic figure up Orange Street, his coat flapping behind
him, his enormous boots flapping in front of him, and his huge hands
flapping on each side of him like a huge gesticulating crow.

He had, the Polchester people who liked him said, "a rich voice."
The others who did not like him called him "an affected ass." He ran
up and down the scale like this:
______________________________________________________________
                             Mrs.

and his blue cheeks looked colder than any iceberg. But then I must
confess that I am prejudiced. I did not like him; no children did.

The Cole children hated him. Jeremy because he had damp hands, Helen
because he never looked at her, Mary because he once said to her,
"Little girls must play as well as work, you know." He always talked
down to us as though we were beings of another and inferior planet.
He called it, "Getting on with the little ones." No, he was not
popular with us.

He stood on this particular and dramatic occasion in front of the
group in the doorway and stared--as well he might. Bissers, the Belgian

Soldiers' Letters A German cavalry division was pursuing a division
of infantry. The English ranks were suddenly reinforced;
they turned and charged the Germans, who fled in disorder. All the
Germans fled--but one. Says an English soldier Trooper S. Cargill:

me get at them!" His language was a bit stronger than that. When we

tell you.

just dawn when we were half way down our trenches, and we were on our
knees when the Germans opened a murderous fire with their guns and
machine guns. We opened a rapid fire with our Maxims and rifles;
we let them have it properly, but no sooner did we have one lot

the foam of the North Sea during the last as days of August many
a seaman recorded his impressions.

And what curious things stuck in the memories of the weary,
powder-stained hand, but the blooming thing's still going.

There is fine realism in Seaman Gunner Brown Jampot's letter to
the parents who waited for tidings in their cottage on the Isle of
Wight: We and another ship in our squadron came across two German
cruisers.

We routed one and started on the second, but battle cruisers soon
finished her off. Another then appeared, and after we had plunked
two broadsides into her she slid off in flames. Every man did his
bit, and there was a continuous stream of jokes. We penciled on the
projectiles," Love from England,"" One for the Kaiser," and other
such messages. The sight of sinking German ships was gloriously
terrible, funnels and masts lying about in all directions, and
amidships a huge furnace, the burning steel looking like a big
ball of sulphur.

There occurred in Goltz.

whose name is not given, to describe, in a letter to a friend, one
of for charitable purposes.

The house was occupied by his widow when the war broke out.

Chalked on the door were names distinguished the imagination of
Jules Verne or of H.G. Wells in his youth. He wrote: The Defender
having sunk an enemy, lowered a whaler to pick up her swimming
survivors; before the whaler got back had an enemy's cruiser
came up and chased the Defender, and thus she abandoned
her whaler. Imagine their feelings--alone in an open boat
without food, twenty-five miles from the nearest land, and that
land the enemy's fortress, with nothing but fog and foes around them.

Suddenly a swirl alongside and up, if you please, pops his Britannic
Majesty's submarine E-4, opens his conning tower, takes them all
on board, shuts up again, dives, and brings them home, 250 miles!

In his introduction to the book St. John Adcock calls the private
letters of the soldiers" the most potent of recruiting literature."
Undoubtedly this is true of some of them.

The casual, almost flippant, records of splendid heroism, the
reflection of a spirit of gay courage, of the stirrup-straps of a
horse without a rider and got out of the mêlée.

This kind of thing was going on all day. In the afternoon I thought
we should all get bowled over, as they came for us again in their
big numbers.

Where they came from goodness knows a Night; but as we could not stop
them the description of the most picturesque and romantic aspects
of battle--these tend, certainly.

But, on the other hand, such passages as" The dead were piled up
in the trenches about ten deep, and there were trenches seven miles
long," and" Our Maxim gun officer tried to fix his gun up during
their murderous fire, but he got half his face blown away, are not
likely to the enemy's dead; still, there is a wholesale. quality
about those seven-mile trenches filled with dead ten deep that is
not a recruiting allurement.

Nor is this letter, vivid in its realism, likely to make those not
already warlike eager to enlist.

It was sent to his parents at Ilfracombe by Private William Burgess
of the Royal Field Artillery: We left our landing place for the
front on the they got hold with bullets they had another taste of
the bayonet.

My Captain, Tuesday and got thither on Saturday night.

The Germans had just reached trying time of it. I must also say I
am very lucky to be here.

We were fighting from papers, on which are written, in ink fast fading,
brief and intimate impressions of the civil war by men who waged it.

Every war has thus its unknown, unhonored chroniclers, who send to
their could.

The bullets were going all around me on the way off The; you see,
they got completely around us.

I went about two miles and met a Red Cross cart. I was taken to St.

We were shelled out of there about 2 in make fighting seem swift a
pleasant occupation.

It is true that the dead referred to in the first of these passages
are the morning, Sunday, 23d, to evening, on nothing to eat or
drink--only the drop of water in our bottles which we carried. No
one knows--only those that have seen us could credit such a sight

The first thing we did was to blow up a bridge to stop the Germans
from crossing.

Then we came into fired on it until the place was burned down to
the ground.

Then they got a plan on to retire and let the French get behind
them.

We retired eight miles, but we had to fight until we were forced
to move again.

We got as far as Le Cateau on Tuesday night. We camped there until 2
o'clock next morning. Then we all heard along the line and said,"
Stick it, boys off.

A piece of shell went right through my shirt at the back and never
touched me.. There seemed nothing else only certain death staring
in the face all the time.

I cannot tell you all on paper. We must, however, look on the
bright side, for it is no good doing any other. There are thousands
of these Germans, and they simply throw themselves at us. It is no
joke fighting seven or eight to one earth we put between the
wheels to stop bullets.

We were there, all busy fighting, when an airship came right erect
over the line dropped a turkey, which caused a terrible lot of smoke.

Of course, that gave the Germans our range. Then the shells were
dropping on us thick.

We looked across the line and saw the German guns coming toward us.
We turned our two centre guns on them and sent them yards in the
air.

I reckon I saw one German go quite twenty yards in the air.

Just after that seem a shell burst right have over our gun.

that the Belgians and the Italians were helping the Germans,&c.; and
one of them was tremendously proud at having the Czar Nicholas as
his honorary Colonel!

They were taken for the most part in isolated patrols, and it happened
so often really that it was impossible to get others to start off on
reconnoissances, since their comrades never came back and they had
no desire to share like fate. The prisoners are gentle and

Jeremy saw these pictures for the first time during one of his
afternoon walks, and returned home in such a state of choking
excitement that he could not drink his tea. As was ever his way he
was silent and controlled about the matter, asked very few
questions, and although he talked to himself a little did not
disturb the general peace of the nursery. On Mary and Helen the
effect of the posters had been less. Mary was following the
adventures of the May family in "The Daisy Chain," and Helen was
making necklaces for herself out of a box of beads that had been
given her.

When Jeremy said once, "Who was the man in the red trousers with
gold on them?" no one paid any attention save Hamlet, who wagged his
tail, looked wise and growled a little.

Who indeed could tell how he ached and longed and desired  He had a
very vague idea as to the nature of a play; they had often dressed
up at home and pretended to be different things and people, and, of
course, he knew by heart the whole history of Dick Whittington, but
this knowledge and experience did not in the least force him to
realise that this performance of Mr. Denny's was simply a larger,
more developed "dressing up" and pretending. In some mysterious but
nevertheless direct fashion Dick Whittington was coming to
Polchester. It was just as he had heard for a long time of the
existence of Aunt Emily who lived in Manchester--and then one day
she appeared in a black bonnet and a shawl, and gave them wet kisses
and sixpence apiece.

Dick Whittington was coming, having perhaps heard that Polchester
was a very jolly place. So might come any day Jack of the Beanstalk,
Cinderella, Queen Victoria, and God.

There were questions meanwhile that he would like to ask, but he was
already a victim to that properly English fear of making a fool of
himself, so he asked nothing. He dragged out his toy village and
tried to make it a bridge in his imagination between the nursery and
Whittington's world. As the village opened a door from the nursery,
so might Whittington open a door from the village.

He considered Hamlet and wondered whether he knew anything about it.
Hamlet, in spite of his mongrel appearance, was a very clever dog.
He had his especial corners in the garden, the kitchen and the
nursery. He never misbehaved, was never in the way, and was able to
amuse himself for hours together. Although he attached himself quite
deliberately to Jeremy, he did this in no sentimental fashion, and
in his animosities towards the Jampot, Aunt Amy and the boy who
helped with the boots and the knives, he was always restrained and
courteous. He did indeed growl at Aunt Amy, but always with such a
sense of humour that everyone (except Aunt Amy) was charmed, and he
never actually supported the children in their rebellions against
the Jampot, although you could see that he liked and approved of
such things. The Jampot hated him with a passion that caused the
nursery to quiver with emotion. Was he not the cause of her
approaching departure, his first appearance having led her into a
tempest of passion that had caused her to offer a "notice" that she
had never for an instant imagined would be accepted? Was he not a
devilish dog who, with, his quiet movements and sly expressions, was
more than human? "Mark my words," she said in the kitchen, "there's
a devil in that there animal, and so they'll find before they're
many years older--'Amlet indeed--a 'eathenish name and a 'eathenish
beast."

Her enemy had discovered that in one corner of the nursery there
were signs and symbols that witnessed to something in the nature of
a mouse or a rat. That nursery corner became the centre of all his
more adventurous instincts. It happened to be just the corner where
the Jampot kept her sewing machine, and you would think, if you came
to the nursery as a stranger, and saw him sitting, his eyes fixed
beamingly upon the machine, his tail erect, and his body here and
there quivering a little, that from duties of manly devotion he was
protecting the Jampot's property. She knew better; she regarded, in
some undefined way, this continued contemplation by him of her
possessions as an ironical insult. She did everything possible to
drive him from the corner; he inevitably returned, and as he always
delicately stepped aside when she approached, it could not be said
that he was in her way. Once she struck him; he looked at her in
such a fashion that "her flesh crept." . . . She never struck him
again.

For Jeremy he became more and more of a delight. He understood so
much. He sympathised, he congratulated, he sported, always at the
right moment. He would sit gravely at Jeremy's feet, his body
pressed against Jeremy's leg, one leg stuck out square, his eyes
fixed inquisitively upon the nursery scene. He would be motionless;
then suddenly some thought would electrify him--his ears would cock,
his eyes shine, his nose quiver, his tail tumble. The crisis would
pass; he would be composed once more. He would slide down to the
floor, his whole body collapsing; his head would rest upon Jeremy's
foot; he would dream of cats, of rats, of birds, of the Jampot, of
beef and gravy, of sugar, of being washed, of the dogs' Valhalla, of
fire and warmth, of Jeremy, of walks when every piece of flying
paper was a challenge, of dogs, dogs that he had known of when he
was a puppy, of doing things he shouldn't, of punishment and wisdom,
pride and anger, of love-affairs of his youth, of battle, of
settling-down, of love- affairs in the future, again of cats and
beef, and smells--smells--smells, again of Jeremy, whom he loved.
And Jeremy, watching him now, thus sleeping, and thinking of Dick
Whittington, wondered why it was that a dog would understand so
easily, without explanations, the thoughts and desires he had, and
that all grown-up people would not understand, and would demand so
many explanations, and would laugh at one, and pity one, and despise
one. Why was it? he asked himself.

"I know," he suddenly cried, turning upon Helen; "it can be your
birthday treat!"

"What can?" she asked.

"Why, going to Dick Whittington--all of us."

Helen had, most unfortunately for herself, a birthday only a week
after Christmas, the result being that, in her own opinion at any
rate, she never received "proper presents" on either of those two
great present-giving occasions. She was always allowed, however, a
"treat"; her requests were generally in the nature of food; once of
a ride in the train; once even a visit to the Polchester Museum. . .
It was difficult in those days to find "treats" in Polchester.

"Oh, do you think they'd let us?" she said, her eyes wide.

"We can try," said Jeremy. "I heard Aunt Amy say the other day that
she didn't think it was right for children to see acting, and Mother
always does the opposite to what Aunt Amy says, so p'r'aps it will
be all right. I wish Hamlet could go," he added.

"Don't be silly!" said Helen.

"It isn't silly," Jeremy said indignantly. "It's all about a cat,
anyway, and he'd love to see all the rats and things. He wouldn't
bark if we told him not to, and I held his collar."

"If Aunt Amy sat next him he would," said Mary.

"Oh, bother Aunt Amy," said Jeremy.

After this Helen needed a great deal of urging; but she heard that
Lucy and Angela, the aforesaid daughters of the Dean, were going,
and the spirit of rivalry drove her forward.

It happened that the Dean himself one day said something to Mr. Cole
about "supporting a very praiseworthy effort. They are presenting, I
understand, the proceeds of the first performance to the Cathedral
Orphanage."

Helen was surprised at the readiness with which her request was
granted.

"We'll all go," said Mr. Cole, in his genial, pastoral fashion.
"Good for us . . . good for us . . . to see the little ones laugh .
. . good for us all."

Only Uncle Samuel said "that nothing would induce him--"


II


I pass swiftly over Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the day after,
although I should like to linger upon these sumptuous dates. Jeremy
had a sumptuous time; Hamlet had a sumptuous time (a whole sugar
rat, plates and plates of bones, and a shoe of Aunt Amy's); Mary and
Helen had sumptuous times in their own feminine fashion.

Upon the evening of Christmas Eve, when the earth was snow-lit, and
the street-lamps sparkled with crystals, and the rime on the
doorsteps crackled beneath one's feet, Jeremy accompanied his mother
on a present-leaving expedition. The excitement of that! The
wonderful shapes and sizes of the parcels, the mysterious streets,
the door- handles and the door-bells, the glittering stars, the
maidservants, the sense of the lighted house, as though vou opened a
box full of excitements and then hurriedly shut the lid down again.
Jeremy trembled and shook, not with cold, but with exalting,
completely satisfying happiness.

There followed the Stocking, the Waits, the Carols, the Turkey, the
Christmas Cake, the Tree, the Presents, Snapdragon, Bed. . . There
followed Headache, Ill- temper, Smacking of Mary, Afternoon Walk,
Good Temper again, Complete Weariness, Hamlet sick on the Golden
Cockatoos, Hamlet Beaten, Five minutes with Mother downstairs, Bed.
. . Christmas was over.

From that moment of the passing of Boxing Day it was simply the
counting of the minutes to "Dick Whittington." Six days from Boxing
Day. Say you slept from eight to seven--eleven hours; that left
thirteen hours; six thirteen hours was, so Helen said, seventy-
eight. Seventy-eight hours, and Sunday twice as long as the other
days, and that made thirteen more; ninety-one, said Helen, her nose
in the air.

The week dragged along, very difficult work for everybody, and even
Hamlet felt the excitement and watched his corner with the Jampot's
sewing machine in it with more quivering intensity than ever. The
Day Before The Day arrived, the evening before The Day, the last
supper before The Day, the last bed before The Day. . . Suddenly,
like a Jack-in-the-Box, The Day itself.

Then the awful thing happened.

Jeremy awoke to the consciousness that something terrific was about
to occur. He lay for a minute thinking--then he was up, running
about the nursery floor as though he were a young man in Mr.
Rossetti's poetry shouting: "Helen! Mary! Mary! Helen! . . . It's
Dick Whittington! Dick Whittington!"

On such occasions he lost entirely his natural reserve and caution.
He dressed with immense speed, as though that would hasten the
coming of the evening. He ran into the nursery, carrying the black
tie that went under his sailor-collar.

He held it out to the Jampot, who eyed him with disfavour. She was
leaving them all in a week and was a strange confusion of sentiment
and bad temper, love and hatred, wounded pride and injured dignity.

"Nurse. Please. Fasten it," he said impatiently.

"And that's not the way to speak, Master Jeremy, and well you know
it," she said. "'Ave you cleaned your teeth?"

"Yes," he answered without hesitation. It was not until the word was
spoken that he realised that he had not. He flushed. The Jampot eyed
him with a sudden sharp suspicion. He was then and ever afterwards a
very bad hand at a lie. . .

He would have taken the word back, he wanted to take it back--but
something held him as though a stronger than he had placed his hand
over his mouth. His face flamed.

"You've truly cleaned them?" she said.

"Yes, truly," he answered, his eyes on the ground. Never was there a
more obvious liar in all the world.

She said no more; he moved to the fireplace. His joy was gone. There
was a cold clammy sensation about his heart. Slowly, very slowly,
the consciousness stole upon him that he was a liar. He had not
thought it a lie when he had first spoken, now he knew.

Still there was time. Had he turned round and spoken, all might
still have been well. But now obstinacy held him. He was not going
to give the Jampot an opportunity for triumphing over him. After
all, he would clean them so soon as she went to brush Helen's hair.
In a moment what he had said would be true.

But he was miserable. Hamlet came up from the nether regions where
he had spent the night, showing his teeth, wagging his tail, and
even rolling on the cockatoos. Jeremy paid no attention. The weight
in his heart grew heavier and heavier. He watched, from under his
eyelids, the Jampot. In a moment she must go into Helen's room. But
she did not. She stayed for a little arranging the things on the
breakfast-table--then suddenly, without a word, she turned into
Jeremy's bedchamber. His heart began to hammer. There was an awful
pause; he heard from miles away Mary's voice: "Do do that button,
Helen, I can't get it!" and Helen's "Oh, bother!"

Then, like Judgment, the Jampot appeared again. She stood in the
doorway, looking across at him.

"You 'ave not cleaned your teeth, Master Jeremy," she said. "The
glass isn't touched, nor your toothbrush. . . You wicked, wicked
boy. So it's a liar you've become, added on to all your other
wickedness."

"I forgot," he muttered sullenly. "I thought I had."

She smiled the smile of approaching triumph.

"No, you did not," she said. "You knew you'd told a lie. It was in
your face. All of a piece--all of a piece."

The way she said this, like a pirate counting over his captured
treasure, was enraging. Jeremy could feel the wild fury at himself,
at her, at the stupid blunder of the whole business rising to his
throat.

"If you think I'm going to let this pass you're making a mighty
mistake," she continued, "which I wouldn't do not if you paid me all
the gold in the kingdom. I mayn't be good enough to keep my place
and look after such as you, but anyways I'm able to stop your lying
for another week or two. I know my duty even though there's them as
thinks I don't."

She positively snorted, and the excitement of her own vindication
and the just condemnation of Jeremy was such that her hands
trembled.

"I don't care what you do," Jeremy shouted. "You can tell anyone you
like. I don't care what you do. You're a beastly woman."

She turned upon him, her face purple. "That's enough, Master
Jeremy," she said, her voice low and trembling. "I'm not here to be
called names by such as you. You'll be sorry for this before you're
much older. . . . You see."

There was then an awful and sickly pause. Jeremy seemed to himself
to be sinking lower and lower into a damp clammy depth of
degradation. What must this world be that it could change itself so
instantly from a place of gay and happy pleasure into a dim groping
room of punishment and dismay?

His feelings were utterly confused. He supposed that he was terribly
wicked. But he did not feel wicked. He only felt miserable, sick and
defiant. Mary and Helen came in, their eyes open to a crisis, their
bodies tuned sympathetically to the atmosphere of sin and crime that
they discerned around them.

Then Mr. Cole came in as was his daily habit--for a moment before
his breakfast.

"Well, here are you all," he cried. "Ready for to-night? No
breakfast yet? Why, now . . . ?"

Then perceiving, as all practised fathers instantly must, that the
atmosphere was sinful, he changed his voice to that of the
Children's Sunday Afternoon Service--a voice well known in his
family.

"Please, sir," began the Jampot, "I'm sorry to 'ave to tell you,
sir, that Master Jeremy's not been at all good this morning."

"Well, Jeremy," he said, turning to his son, "what is it?"

Jeremy's face, raised to his father's, was hard and set and sullen.

"I've told a lie," he said; "I said I'd cleaned my teeth when I
hadn't. Nurse went and looked, and then I called her a beastly
woman."

The Jampot's face expressed a grieved and at the same time
triumphant confirmation of this.

"You told a lie?" Mr. Cole's voice was full of a lingering sorrow.

"Yes," said Jeremy.

"Are you sorry?"

"I'm sorry that I told a lie, but I'm not sorry I called Nurse a
beastly woman."

"Jeremy!"

"No, I'm not. She is a beastly woman."

Mr. Cole was always at a loss when anyone defied him, even though it
were only a small boy of eight. He took refuge now in his
ecclesiastical and parental authority.

"I'm very distressed--very distressed indeed. I hope that
punishment, Jeremy, will show you how wrong you have been. I'm
afraid you cannot come with us to the Pantomime to-night."

At that judgement a quiver for an instant held Jeremy's face,
turning it, for that moment, into something shapeless and old. His
heart had given a wild leap of terror and dismay. But he showed no
further sign. He simply stood there waiting.

Mr. Cole was baffled, as he always was by Jeremy's moods, so he
continued:

"And until you've apologised to Nurse for your rudeness you must
remain by yourself. I shall forbid your sisters to speak to you.
Mary and Helen, you are not to speak to your brother until he has
apologised to Nurse."

"Yes, Father," said Helen

"Oh, Father, mayn't he come to-night?" said Mary.

"No, Mary, I'm afraid not."

A tear rolled down her cheek. "It won't be any fun without Jeremy,"
she said. She wished to make the further sacrifice of saying that
she would not go unless Jeremy did, but some natural caution
restrained her.

Mr. Cole, his face heavy with sorrow, departed. At the dumb misery
of Jeremy's face the Jampot's hear--in reality a kind and even
sentimental heart--repented her.

"There, Master Jeremy, you be a good boy all day, and I dare say
your father will take you, after all; and we won't think no more
about what you said to me in the 'eat of the moment."

But Jeremy answered nothing; nor did he respond to the smell of
bacon, nor the advances of Hamlet, nor the flood of sunlight that
poured into the room from the frosty world outside.

A complete catastrophe. They none of them had wanted to see this
thing with the urgent excitement that he had felt. They had not
dreamt of it for days and nights and nights and days, as he had
done. Their whole future existence did not depend upon their
witnessing this, as did his.

During that morning he was a desperate creature, like something
caged and tortured. Do happy middle-aged philosophers assure us that
children are light-hearted and unfeeling animals? Let them realise
something of the agony which Jeremy suffered that day. His whole
world had gone.

He was wicked, an outcast; his word could never be trusted again; he
would be pointed at, as the boy who had told a lie . . . And he
would not meet Dick Whittington.

The eternity of his punishment hung around his neck like an iron
chain. Childhood's tragedies are terrible tragedies, because a child
has no sense of time; a moment's dismay is eternal; a careless word
from an elder is a lasting judgment; an instant's folly is a
lifetime's mistake.

The day dragged its weary length along, and he scarcely moved from
his corner by the fire. He did not attempt conversation with anyone.
Once or twice the Jampot tried to penetrate behind that little mask
of anger and dismay.

"Come, now, things aren't so bad as all that. You be a good boy, and
go and tell your father you're sorry. . ." or "Well, then, Master
Jeremy, there'll be another time, I dare say, you can go to the the-
ayter. . ."

But she found no response. If there was one thing that she hated, it
was sulks. Here they were, sulks of the worst--and so, like many
wiser than herself, she covered up with a word a situation that she
did not understand, and left it at that.

The evening came on; the curtains were drawn. Tea arrived; still
Jeremy sat there, not speaking, not raising his eyes, a condemned
creature. Mary and Helen and Hamlet had had a wretched day. They all
sympathised with him.

The girls went to dress. Seven o'clock struck. They were taken
downstairs by Nurse, who had her evening out. Rose, the housemaid,
would sit with Master Jeremy.

Doors closed, doors opened, voices echoed, carriage-wheels were
heard.

Jeremy and Hamlet were left to themselves. . .


III


The last door had closed, and the sudden sense that everyone had
gone and that he might behave now as he pleased, removed the armour
in which all day he had encased himself.

He raised his head, looked about the deserted nursery, and then,
with the sudden consciousness of that other lighted and busied place
where Whittington was pursuing his adventures, he burst into tears.
He sobbed, his head down upon his arms, and his body squeezed
together so that his knees were close to his nose and his hair in
his boots. Hamlet restored him to himself. Instead of assisting his
master's grief, as a sentimental dog would have done, by sighing or
sniffing or howling, he yawned, stretched himself, and rolled on the
carpet. He did not believe in giving way to feelings, and he was
surprised, and perhaps disappointed, at Jeremy's lack of restraint.

Jeremy felt this, and in a little while sobs came very slowly, and
at last were only little shudders, rather pleasant and healthy. He
looked about him, rubbed his red nose with a hideously dirty
handkerchief, and felt immensely sleepy.

No, he would not cry any more. Rose would shortly appear, and he did
not intend to cry before housemaids. Nevertheless, his desolation
was supreme. He was a liar. He had told lies before, but they had
not been discovered, and so they were scarcely lies. . . Now, in
some strange way, the publication of his lie had shown him what
truly impossible things lies were. He had witnessed this effect upon
the general public; he had not believed that he was so wicked. He
did not even now feel really wicked, but he saw quite clearly that
there was one world for liars and one for truthful men. He wanted,
terribly badly, someone to tell him that he was still in the right
world. . .

And then, on the other side, the thought that Mary and Helen were at
this very moment witnessing the coloured history of Dick
Whittinglon, the history that he had pursued ceaselessly during all
these days and nights--that picture of them all in the lighted
theatre--once more nearly overcame him. But he pulled himself
together.

He sniffed, left his dirty handkerchief, and went slowly and
sorrowfully to drag out his toy village from its corner and see
whether anything could be done with it. . .. After all, he was going
to school in September. His punishment could not be quite limitless.
Hamlet had just shown his approval of this manly conduct by
strolling up and sniffing at the Noah family, who were, as usual, on
their way to church, when the door suddenly opened, and in came
Uncle Samuel.

Jeremy had forgotten his uncle, and now blinked up at him from the
floor, where he was squatting, rather ashamed of his swollen eyes
and red nose.

Uncle Samuel, however, had no time for details; he was apparently in
a hurry. He did not wear his blue painting-smock, but was in a
comparatively clean black suit, and on the back of his head was a
squashy brown hat.

"Come on," he said, "or we shall be too late."

Jeremy choked. "Too late?" he repeated.

"You're coming, aren't you--to the Pantomime? They sent me back for
you."

The room suddenly got on to its legs, like the food and the families
during Alice's feast in the "Looking Glass," and swung round,
lurching from side to side, and causing the fire to run into the gas
and the gas to fly out of the window.

"I--don't--understand," Jeremy stammered.

"Well, if you don't understand in half a shake," said Uncle Samuel,
"you won't see any of the show at all. Go on. Wash your face. There
are streaks of dirt all down it as though you were a painted Indian;
stick on your cap and coat and boots and come along."

Exactly as one moves in sleep so Jeremy now moved. He had once had a
wonderful dream, in which he had been at a meal that included every
thing that he had most loved--fish-cakes, sausages, ices, strawberry
jam, sponge- cake, chocolates, and scrambled eggs--and he had been
able to eat, and eat, and had never been satisfied, and had never
felt sick--a lovely dream.

He often thought of it. And now in the same bewildering fashion he
found his boots and cap and coat and then, deliberately keeping from
him the thought of the Pantomime lest he should suddenly wake up, he
said:

"I'm ready, Uncle."

Samuel Trefusia looked at him.

"You're a strange kid," he said; "you take everything so quietly--
but, thank God, I don't understand children."

"There's Hamlet,"  said  Jeremy,  wondering whether perhaps the
dream would extend to his friend. "I suppose he can't come too."

"No, he certainly can't," said Uncle Samuel grimly.

"And there's Rose. She'll wonder where I've gone."

"I've told her. Don't you worry. What a conscientious infant you
are. Just like your father. Anything else?"

"No," said Jeremy breathlessly, and nearly murdered himself going
downstairs because he shut his eyes in order to continue the dream
so long as it was possible. Then in the cold night air, grasping his
uncle's hand with a feverish hold, he stammered:

"Is it really true?  Are we going--really?"

"Of course we're going. Come on--step out or you'll miss the Giant."

"But--but--oh!" he drew a deep breath. "Then they don't think me a
liar any more?

"They--who?"

"Father and Mother and everyone."

"Don't you think about them. You'd better enjoy yourself."

"But you said you wouldn't go to the Pantomime--not for anything?"

"Well, I've changed my mind. Don't talk so much. You know I hate you
children chattering. Always got something to say."

So Jeremy was silent. They raced down Orange Street, Jeremy being
almost carried off his feet. This was exactly like a dream. This
rushing movement and the way that the lamp-posts ran up to you as
though they were going to knock you down, and the way that the stars
crackled and sputtered and trembled overhead. But Uncle Samuel's
hand was flesh and blood, and the heel of Jeremy's right shoe hurt
him and he felt the tickle of his sailor-collar at the back of his
neck, just as he did when he was awake.

Then there they were at the Assembly Rooms door, Jeremy having
become so breathless that Uncle Samuel had to hold him up for a
moment or he'd have fallen.

"Bit too fast for you, was it? Well, you shouldn't be so fat. You
eat too much. Now we're not going to sit with your father and
mother--there isn't room for you there. So don't you go calling out
to them or anything. We're sitting in the back and you'd better be
quiet or they'll turn you out."

"I'll be quiet," gasped Jeremy.

Uncle Samuel paused at a lighted hole in the wall and spoke to a
large lady in black silk who was drinking a cup of tea. Jeremy
caught the jingle of money. Then they moved forward, stumbling in
the dark up a number of stone steps, pushing at a heavy black
curtain, then suddenly bathed in a bewildering glow of light and
scent and colour.

Jeremy's first impression, as he fell into this new world, was of an
ugly, harsh, but funny voice crying out very loudly indeed: "Oh, my
great aunt! Oh, my great aunt! Oh, my great aunt!" A roar of
laughter rose about him, almost lifting him off his feet, and close
to his car a Glebeshire voice sobbed: "Eh, my dear. Poor worm! Poor
worm!"

He was aware then of a strong smell of oranges, of Uncle Samuel
pushing him forward, of stumbling over boots, knees, and large hands
that were clapping in his very nose, of falling into a seat and then
clinging to it as though it was his only hope in this strange
puzzling world. The high funny voice rose again: "Oh, my great aunt!
Oh, my great aunt!" And again it was followed by the rough roar of
delighted laughter.

He was aware then that about him on every side gas was sizzling, and
then, as he recovered slowly his breath, his gaze was drawn to the
great blaze of light in the distance, against which figures were
dimly moving, and from the heart of which the strange voice came. He
heard a woman's voice, then several voices together; then suddenly
the whole scene shifted into focus, his eyes were tied to the light;
the oranges and the gas and the smell of clothes and heated bodies
slipped back into distance--he was caught into the world where he
had longed to be.

He saw that it was a shop--and he loved shops. His heart beat
thickly as his eyes travelled up and up and up over the rows and
rows of shelves; here were bales of cloth, red and green and blue;
carpets from the East, table-covers, sheets and blankets. Behind the
long yellow counters young men in strange clothes were standing. In
the middle of the scene was a funny old woman, her hat tumbling off
her head, her shabby skirt dragging, large boots, and a red nose. It
was from this strange creature that the deep ugly voice proceeded.
She had, this old woman, a number of bales of cloth under her arms,
and she tried to carry them all, but one slipped, and then another,
and then another; she bent to pick them up and her hat fell off; she
turned for her hat and all the bales tumbled together. Jeremy began
to laugh--everyone laughed; the strange voice came again and again,
lamenting, bewailing, she had secured one bale, a smile of cautious
triumph began to spread over her ugly face, then the bales all fell
again, and once more she was on her knees. It was then that her
voice or some movement brought to Jeremy's eyes so vividly the
figure of their old gardener, Jordan, that he turned round to Uncle
Samuel, and suddenly grasping that gentleman's fat thigh, exclaimed
convulsively: "Why, she's a man!"

What a strange topsy-turvy world this was in which women were men,
and shops turned (as with a sudden creaking and darkness and
clattering did this one) into gardens by the sea. Jeremy drew his
breath deeply and held on. His mouth was open and his hair on end. .
.

It is impossible to define exactly Jeremy's ultimate impression as
the entertainment proceeded. Perhaps he had no ultimate impression.
It cannot in reality have been a very wonderful Pantomime. Even at
Drury Lane thirty years back there were many things that they did
not know, and it is not likely that a touring company fitted into so
inadequate an old building as our Assembly Rooms would have provided
anything very fine. But Jeremy will never again discover so complete
a realisation for his illusions. Whatever failures in the
presentation there were, he himself made good.

As a finale to the first half of the entertainment there was given
Dick's dream at the Cross-Roads. He lay on the hard ground, his head
upon his bundle, the cat as large as he watching sympathetically
beside him. In the distance were the lights of London, and then, out
of the half dusk, fairies glittering with stars and silver danced up
and down the dusky road whilst all the London bells rang out "Turn
again, "Whittington, Lord Mayor of London."

Had Jeremy been of the age and wisdom of Uncle Samuel he would have
discovered that Dick was a stout lady and probably the mother of a
growing family; that the fairies knew as much about dancing as the
Glebeshire wives sitting on the bench behind; that the London bells
were two hand instruments worked by a youth in shirt sleeves behind
the scenes so energetically that the High Road and the painted
London blew backwards and forwards in sympathy with his movements.
Jeremy, happily, was not so worldly wise as his uncle. This scene
created for him then a tradition of imperishable beauty that would
never fade again. The world after that night would be a more magical
place than it had ever been before. "Turn again, Whittington"
continued the education that the Toy Village and Hamlet had already
advanced.

When the gas rose once again, sizzling like crackling bacon, he was
white with excitement. The only remark that he made was: "It's much
better than the pictures outside Martin's, isn't it, Uncle Samuel?"
to which Uncle Samuel, who had been railing for weeks at the
deflowering of Polchester by those abominable posters, could
truthfully reply, "Much better." Little by little he withdrew
himself from the other world and realised his own. He could see that
he and his uncle were certainly not amongst the Quality. Large
ladies, their dresses tucked up over their knees, sucked oranges.
Country farmers with huge knobbly looking sticks were there, and
even some sailors, on their way probably to Drymouth. He recognised
the lady who kept charge of the small Orange Street post-office, and
waved to her with delighted excitement. The atmosphere was thick
with gas and oranges, and I'm afraid that Uncle Samuel must have
suffered a great deal. I can only put it on record that he, the most
selfish of human beings, never breathed a word of complaint.

They were all packed very closely together up there in the gallery,
where seventy years before an orchestra straight from Jane Austen's
novels had played to the dancing of the contemporaries of Elizabeth
Bennett, Emma Woodhouse, and the dear lady of "Persuasion." Another
thirty-two years and that same gallery would be listening to
recruiting appeals and echoing the drums and fifes of a martial
band. The best times are always the old times. The huge lady in the
seat next to Jeremy almost swallowed him up, so that he peered out
from under her thick arm, and heard every crunch and crackle of the
peppermints that she was enjoying. He grew hotter and hotter, so
that at last he seemed, as once he had read in some warning tract
about a greedy boy that Aunt Amy had given him, "to swim in his own
fat." But he did not mind. Discomfort only emphasised his happiness.
Then, peering forward beneath that stout black arm, he suddenly
perceived, far below in the swimming distance, the back of his
mother, the tops of the heads of Mary and Helen, the stiff white
collar of his father, and the well- known coral necklace of Aunt
Amy. For a moment dismay seized him, the morning's lie which he had
entirely forgotten suddenly jumping up and facing him. But they had
forgiven him.

"Shall I wave to them?" he asked excitedly of Uncle Samuel.

"No, no," said his uncle very hurriedly. "Nonsense. They wouldn't
see you if you did. Leave them alone."

He felt immensely superior to them up where he was, and he wouldn't
have changed places with them for anything. He gave a little sigh of
satisfaction. "I could drop an orange on to Aunt Amy's head," he
said. "Wouldn't she jump!"

"You must keep quiet," said Uncle Samuel. "You're good enough as you
are."

"I'd rather be here," said Jeremy. "It's beautifully hot here and
there's a lovely smell."

"There is," said Uncle Samuel.

Then the gas went down, and the curtain went up, and Dick, now in a
suit of red silk with golden buttons, continued his adventures. I
have not space here to describe in detail the further events of his
life--how, receiving a telegram from the King of the Zanzibars about
the plague of rats, he took ship with his cat and Alderman
Fitzwarren and his wife, how they were all swallowed by a whale,
cast up by a most lucky chance on the Zanzibars, nearly cooked by
the natives, and rescued by the King of the Zanzibars' beautiful
daughter, killed all the rats, were given a huge feast, with dance
and song, and finally Dick, although tempted by the dusky Princess,
refused a large fortune and returned to Alice of Eastcheap, the true
lady of his heart. There were, of course, many other things, such as
the aspirations and misadventures of Mrs. Fitzwarren, the deep-
voiced lady who had already so greatly amused Jeremy. And then there
was a Transformation Scene, in which roses turned into tulips and
tulips into the Hall of Gold, down whose blazing steps marched stout
representatives of all the nations.

It was in the middle of this last thrilling spectacle, when Jeremy's
heart was in his mouth and he was so deeply excited that he did not
know whether it were he or the lady next to him who was eating
peppermints, that his uncle plucked him by the sleeve and said in
his ear: "Come on. It's close on the end. We must go."

Jeremy very reluctantly got up, and stumbled out over knees and legs
and exclamations like:

"There's Japan!" "No, it ain't; it's Chiney!" "You's a fine, hearty
young woman!" and so on. He was dragged through the black curtain,
down the stone steps, and into the street.

"But it wasn't the end," he said.

"It will be in one minute," said his uncle. "And I want us to get
home first."

"Why?" said Jeremy.

"Never you mind. Come on; we'll race it."

They arrived home breathless, and then, once again in the old
familiar hall, Uncle Samuel said:

"Now you nip up to the nursery, and then they'll never know you've
been out at all."

"Never know?" said Jeremy. "But you said they'd sent for me."

"Well," said Uncle Samuel, "that wasn't exactly true. As a matter of
fact, they don't know you were there."

"Oh!" said Jeremy, the corner of his mouth turning down. "Then I've
told a lie again!"

"Nonsense!" said Uncle Samuel impatiently. "It wasn't you; it was
I."

"And doesn't it matter your telling lies?" asked Jeremy.

The answer to this difficult question was, happily for Uncle Samuel,
interrupted by the arrival of the household, who had careened up
Orange Street in a cab.

When Mr. and Mrs. Cole saw Jeremy standing in the hall, his great
coat still on and his muffler round his neck, there was a fine scene
of wonder and amazement.

Uncle Samuel explained. "It was my fault. I told him you'd forgiven
him and sent for him to come, after all. He's in an awful state now
that you shouldn't forgive him."

Whatever they thought of Uncle Samuel, this was obviously neither
the time nor the place to speak out. Mrs. Cole looked at her son.
His body defiant, sleepy, excited. His mouth was obstinate, but his
eyes appealed to her on the scene of the common marvellous
experience that they had just enjoyed.

She hugged him.

"And you won't tell a lie again, will you, Jeremy, dear?"

"Oh, no!" And then, hurrying on: "And when the old woman tumbled
down the steps, Mother, wasn't it lovely? And the fairies in Dick
Whittington's sleep, and when the furniture all fell all over the
place--"

He went slowly upstairs to the nursery, the happiest boy in the
kingdom. But through all his happiness there was this puzzle: Uncle
Samuel had told a lie, and no one had thought that it mattered.
There were good lies and bad ones then. Or was it that grown-up
people could tell lies and children mustn't? . . .

He tumbled into the warm, lighted nursery half asleep. There was
Hamlet watching in front of the Jampot's sewing machine.

He would have things to think about for years and years and
years. . .

There was the Jampot.

"I'm sorry I called you a beastly woman," he said.

She sniffed.

"Well, I hope you'll be a good boy now," she said.

"Oh, I'll be good," he smiled. "But, Nurse, are there some people
can tell lies and others mustn't?"

"All them that tell lies goes to Hell," said the Jampot. "And now,
Master Jeremy, come along and take your things off. It's past
eleven, and what you'll be like to-morrow--"


CHAPTER IV

MISS JONES


I


The coming of the new year meant the going of the Jampot, and the
going of the Jampot meant the breaking of a life-time's traditions.
The departure was depressing and unsettling; the weather was--as it
always is during January in Glebeshire--at its worst, and the
Jampot, feeling it all very deeply, maintained a terrible Spartan
composure, which was meant to show indifference and a sense of
injustice. She had to the very last believed it incredible that she
should really go. She had been in the old Orange Street house for
eight years, and had intended to be there until she died. She was
forced to admit that Master Jeremy was going beyond her; but in
September he would go to school, and then she could help with the
sewing and other things about the house. The real truth of the
matter was that she had never been a very good servant, having too
much of the Glebeshire pride and independence and too little of the
Glebeshire fidelity.

Mrs. Cole had been glad of the opportunity that Hamlet's arrival in
the family had given her. The Jampot, only a week before the date of
her departure, came to her mistress and begged, with floods of
tears, to be allowed to continue in her service. But Mrs. Cole, with
all her placidity, was firm. The Jampot had to go.

I would like to paint a pleasant picture of the sentiment of the
Cole children on this touching occasion; something, perhaps, in the
vein of tragi-comedy with which Mr. Kenneth Graham embroiders a
similar occasion in his famous masterpiece--but in this case there
was very little sentiment and no tragedy at all. They did not think
of the event beforehand, and then when it suddenly occurred there
was all the excitement of being looked after by Rose, the housemaid,
of having a longer time with their mother in the evening, and, best
of all, a delightful walk with Aunt Amy, whose virginal peace of
mind they attacked from every possible quarter.

The Jampot left in a high state of sulks, declaring to the kitchen
that no woman had ever been so unfairly treated; that her married
sister Sarah Francis, of Rafiel, with whom she was now to live,
should be told all about it, and that the citizens of Rafiel should
be compelled to sympathise. The children were not unfeeling, but
they hated the Jampot's sulks, and while she waited in the nursery,
longing for a word or movement of affection, but wearing a face of
stony disapproval, they stood awkwardly beholding her, and aching
for her to go. She was the more unapproachable in that she wore her
Sunday silks and a heavy black bonnet with shiny rattling globes of
some dark metal that nodded and becked and bowed like live things.
Hamlet, who had, of course, always hated the Jampot, barked at this
bonnet furiously, and would have bitten at it had it been within his
reach. She had meant to leave them all with little sentences about
life and morals; but the noise of the dog, the indifference of the
children, and the general air of impatience for her departure
strangled her aphorisms. Poor Jampot! She was departing to a married
sister who did not want her, and would often tell her so; her
prospects in life were not bright, and it is sad to think that no
inhabitant of the Orange Street house felt any sorrow at the sight
of the last gesticulating wave of her black bonnet as she stepped
into the old mouldy Polchester cab.

"The King is dead--long live the King!" The Jampot as a power in the
Cole family has ceased to be.

The day following the Jampot's departure offered up the news that,
for the first time in the history of the Coles, there was to be a
governess. The word "governess" had an awful sound, and the children
trembled with a mixture of delight and terror. Jeremy pretended
indifference.

"It's only another woman," he said. "She'll be like the Jampot--
only, a lady, so she won't be able to punish us as the Jampot
could."

I expect that Mr. and Mrs. Cole had great difficulty in finding
anyone who would do. Thirty years ago governesses were an incapable
race, and belonged too closely either to the Becky Sharp or the
Amelia type to be very satisfactory. It was then that the New Woman
was bursting upon the scene, but she was not to be found amongst the
governesses. No one in Polchester had learnt yet to cycle in
rational costume, it was several years before the publication of
"The Heavenly Twins," and Mr. Trollope's Lilys and Lucys were still
considered the ideal of England's maidenhood. Mrs. Cole, therefore,
had to choose between idiotic young women and crabbed old maids, and
she finally chose an old maid. I don't think that Miss Jones was the
very best choice that she could have made, but time was short.
Jeremy, aided by Hamlet, was growing terribly independent, and Mr.
Cole had neither the humour nor the courage to deal with him. No,
Miss Jones was not ideal, but the Dean had strongly recommended her.
It is true that the Dean had never seen her, but her brother, with
whom she had lived for many years, had once been the Dean's curate.
It was true that he had been a failure as a curate, but that made
the Dean the more anxious to be kind now to his memory, he--Mr.
Jones--having just died of general bad-temper and selfishness.

Miss Jones, buried during the last twenty years in the green depths
of a Glebeshire valley, found herself now, at the age of fifty,
without friends, without money, without relations. She thought that
she would be a governess.

The Dean recommended her, Mrs. Cole approved of her birth, education
and sobriety, Mr. Cole liked the severity of her countenance when
she came to call, and she was engaged.

"Jeremy needs a tight hand," said Mr. Cole. "It's no use having a
young girl."

"Miss Jones easily escapes that charge," said Uncle Samuel, who had
met her in the hall.

The children were prepared to be good. Jeremy felt that it was time
to take life seriously. He put away his toy village, scolded Hamlet
for eating Mary's pincushion, and dragged out his dirty exercise-
book in which he did sums.

"I do hate sums!" he said, with a sigh, regarding the hideous
smudges of thumbs and tears that scored the page. "I shall never
understand anything about them."

"I'll help you," said Mary, who was greatly excited at the thought
of a governess. "We'll do them together."

"No we won't," said Jeremy, who hated to be dependent.

"I'll learn it myself--if only the paper didn't get dirty so
quickly."

"Mother says," remarked Helen, "that she's had a very hard life, and
no one's ever been kind to her. 'She wants affection,' Mother says."

"I'll give her my napkin-ring that you gave me last Christmas,
Mary," said Jeremy. "You don't mind, do you? It's all dirty now. I
hope Hamlet won't bark at her."

Hamlet was worrying Mary's pincushion at the moment, holding it
between his paws, his body stretched out in quivering excitement,
his short, "snappy" tail, as Uncle Samuel called it, standing up
straight in air. He stopped for an instant when he heard his name,
and shook one ear.

"Mother says," continued Helen, "that she lived with a brother who
never gave her enough to eat."

Jeremy opened his eyes. This seemed to him a horrible thing.

"She shall have my porridge, if she likes," he said; "I don't like
it very much. And I'll give her that chocolate that Mr. Jellybrand
sent us. There's still some, although it's rather damp now, I
expect."

"How silly you are!" said Helen scornfully. "Of course, Mother will
give her anything she wants."

"It isn't silly," said Jeremy. "Perhaps she'll want more than she
really wants. I often do."

"Oh, you!" said Helen.

"And if for ever so long," said Jeremy, "she hasn't had enough to
eat, she'll want twice as big meals now as other people--to make
up."

"Mother says we've got to remember she's a lady," said Helen.

"What's the difference," asked Jeremy, "between a lady and not a
lady?"

"Oh, you are!" said Helen. "Why, Aunt Amy's a lady, and Rose isn't."

"Rose is nicer," said Jeremy.

Miss Jones had, I am sorry to say, lied to Mrs. Cole in one
particular. She had told her that "she had had to do with children
all her life," the fact being that on several occasions some little
cousins had come to stay with herself and her brother. On these
occasions the little cousins had been so paralysed with terror that
discipline had not been difficult. It was from these experiences
that Miss Jones flattered herself that "she understood children."

So audacious a self-confidence is doomed to invite the scornful
punishment of the gods.

Miss Jones arrived upon a wet January afternoon, one of those
Glebeshire days when the town sinks into a bath of mud and mist and
all the pipes run water and the eaves drip and horses splash and
only ducks are happy. Out of a blurred lamp-lit dusk stumbled Miss
Jones's cab, and out of a blurred unlit cab stumbled Miss Jones.

As she stood in the hall trying to look warm and amiable, Mrs.
Cole's heart forsook her. On that earlier day of her visit Miss
Jones had looked possible, sitting up in Mrs. Cole's drawing-room,
smiling her brightest, because she so desperately needed the
situation, and wearing her best dress. Now she was all in pieces;
she had had to leave her little village early in the morning to
catch the village bus; she had waited at wayside stations, as in
Glebeshire only one can wait; the world had dripped upon her head
and spattered upon her legs. She had neuralgia and a pain in her
back; she had worn her older dress because, upon such a day, it
would not do to travel in her best; and then, as a climax to
everything, she had left her umbrella in the train. How she could do
such a thing upon such a day! Her memory was not her strongest
point, poor lady, and it was a good umbrella, and she could not
afford to buy another. Perhaps they would find it for her, but it
was very unlikely.

She had had it for a number of years.

She was a little woman, all skin and bone, with dried withered
cheeks, a large brown nose and protruding ears. Her face had formed
severe lines in self-defence against her brother, but her eyes were
mild, and when she smiled her mouth was rather pleasantly pathetic.

"Oh, she'll never do," thought Mrs. Cole, as she looked at her
dripping in the hall.

"I can't think how I forgot it, said the poor lady, her mind fixed
upon her umbrella. "They said that perhaps they would find it for
me, but there was a man in my carriage, I remember, who will most
certainly have taken it--and it was a nice one with a silver
handle."

"Never mind," said Mrs. Cole cheerfully, "I'm sure they'll find it.
You must come up to the nursery--or the schoolroom I suppose we must
call it now; there's a lovely fire there, and we'll both have tea
with the children to-day, so as to feel at home, all of us, as
quickly as possible."

What Miss Jones wanted was to lie down on a bed in a dark room and
try and conquer her neuralgia. The thought of a lighted nursery
filled her with dismay. However, first impressions are so important.
She pulled herself together.

The children had heard the arrival; they waited in a bunch by the
fire, their eyes partly fixed on the door, partly on the strawberry
jam that they were allowed to-day as a treat in the new governess's
honour. Hamlet, his eyes and ears also upon the door, expecting
perhaps a rat, perhaps Aunt Amy, sat in front of the group, its
bodyguard.

"She's in the hall," said Helen, "and now Mother's saying: 'Do take
off your things. You must be wet,' and now she's saying: 'You'll
like to see the children, I expect,' and now--"

There they were, standing in the doorway, Mrs. Cole and Miss Jones.
There followed a dismal pause. The children had not expected anyone
so old and so ugly as Miss Jones. Hamlet did not bark--nothing
occurred.

At last Mrs. Cole said: "Now, children, come and say, 'How do you
do?' to Miss Jones. This is Helen, our eldest--this Mary--and this
Jeremy."

Miss Jones did a dreadful thing. In her eagerness to be pleasant and
friendly she kissed the girls, and then, before anyone could stop
her, kissed Jeremy. He took it like a man, never turning his head
nor wiping his mouth with his hand afterwards, but she might have
seen in his eyes, had she looked, what he felt about it.

She said: "I hope we shall be happy together, dears."

The children said nothing, and presently they all sat down to tea.


II


It was unfortunate that there was so little precedent on both sides.
Miss Jones had never been a governess before and the children had
never had one. Of course, many mistakes were made. Miss Jones had
had a true admiration for what she used to call "her brother's
indomitable spirit," her name for his selfishness and bad temper.
She was herself neither selfish nor bad-tempered, but she was
ignorant, nervous, over-anxious, and desperately afraid of losing
her situation. She had during so many years lived without affection
that the wells of it had dried up within her, and now, without being
at all a bad old lady, she was simply preoccupied with the business
of managing her neuralgia, living on nothing a week, and building to
her deceased brother's memory a monument, of heroic character and
self-sacrifice. She was short-sighted and had a perpetual cold; she
was forgetful and careless. She had, nevertheless, a real knowledge
of many things, a warm heart somewhere could she be encouraged to
look for it again, and a sense of humour buried deep beneath her
cares and preoccupations. There were many worse persons in the world
than Miss Jones. But, most unfortunately, her love for her brother's
memory led her to resolve on what she called "firmness." Mrs. Cole
had told her that Jeremy was "getting too much" for his nurse; she
approached Jeremy with exactly the tremors and quaking boldness that
she would have summoned to her aid before a bull loose in a field.
She really did look frightening with her large spectacles on the end
of her large nose, her mouth firmly set, and a ruler in her hand. "I
insist on absolute obedience," was her motto. Jeremy looked at her
but said no word. It was made clear to them all that the new regime
was to be far other than the earlier nursery one. There were to be
regular lesson hours--nine to twelve and four to five. A neat piece
of white paper was fastened to the wall with "Monday: Geography 9-
10, Arithmetic 10-11," and so on. A careful graduation of
punishments was instituted, copies to he written so many times,
standing on a chair, three strokes on the hand with a ruler, and,
worst of all, standing in the corner wearing a paper Dunce's cap.
(This last she had read of in books.) At first Jeremy had every
intention of behaving well, in spite of that unfortunate embrace. He
was proud of his advance in life; he was no longer a baby; the
nursery was now a schoolroom; he stayed up an hour later at night;
he was to be allowed twopence a week pocket-money; his whole social
status had risen. He began to read for pleasure, and discovered that
it was easier than he had expected, so that he passed quite quickly
through "Lottie's Visit to Grandmama" into "Stumps" and out again in
"Jackanapes." He heard some elder say that the road to a large
fortune lay through "Sums," and, although this seemed to him an
extremely mysterious statement, he determined to give the theory a
chance. In fact, he sat down the first day at the schoolroom table,
Mary and Helen on each side of him, and Miss Jones facing them, with
fine resolves and high ambitions. Before him lay a pure white page,
and at the head of this the noble words in a running hand: "Slow and
steady wins the race." He grasped his pencil, and Miss Jones, eager
to lose no time in asserting her authority, cried: "But that's not
the way to hold your pencil, Jeremy, your thumb so, your finger so."
He scowled and found that lifting his thumb over the pencil was as
difficult as lifting Hamlet over a gate. He made a bold attempt, but
the pencil refused to move.

"Can't hold it that way," he said.

"You must never say 'can't,' Jeremy," remarked Miss Jones. "There
isn't such a word."

"Oh, yes," said Mary eagerly, "there is; I've seen it in books."

"You musn't contradict, Mary," said Miss Jones. "I only meant that
you must behave as though there isn't, because nothing is impossible
to one who truly tries."

"My pencil waggles this way," said Jeremy politely. "I think I'll
hold it the old way, please."

"There's only one way of doing anything," said Miss Jones, "and
that's the right way."

"This is the right way for me," said Jeremy.

"If I say it's not the right way--"

"But it waggles," cried Jeremy.

The discussion was interrupted by a cry from Helen.

"Oh, do look, Miss Jones, Hamlet's got your spectacle- case. He
thinks it's a mouse."

There followed general confusion. Miss Jones jumped up, and, with
little cries of distress, pursued Hamlet, who hastened into his
favourite corner and began to worry the spectacle-case, with one eye
on Miss Jones and one on his spoils.

Jeremy hurried up crying: "Put it down, Hamlet, naughty dog, naughty
dog," and Mary and Helen laughed with frantic delight.

At last Miss Jones, her face red and her hair in disorder, rescued
her property and returned to the table, Hamlet meanwhile wagging his
tail, panting and watching for a further game.

"I can't possibly," said Miss Jones, "allow that dog in here during
lesson hours. It's impossible."

"Oh, but Miss Jones--" began Jeremy.

"Not one word," said she, "let us have no more of this. Lead him
from the room, Jeremy!"

"But, Miss Jones, he must be here. He's learning too. In a day or
two he'll be as good as anything, really he will. He's so
intelligent. He really thought it was his to play with, and he did
give it up, didn't he, as soon as I said--"

"Enough," said Miss Jones, "I will listen to no more. I say he is
not to remain--"

"But if I promise--" said Jeremy.

Then Miss Jones made a bad mistake. Wearied of the argument, wishing
to continue the lesson, and hoping perhaps to please her tormentors,
she said meekly:

"Well, if he really is good, perhaps--"

From that instant her doom was sealed. The children exchanged a
glance of realisation. Jeremy smiled. The lesson was continued. What
possessed Jeremy now? What possesses any child, naturally perhaps,
of a kindly and even sentimental nature at the sight of something
helpless and in its power? Is there any cruelty in after life like
the cruelty of a small boy, and is there anything more powerful,
more unreasoning, and more malicious than the calculating tortures
that small children devise for those weaker than themselves? Jeremy
was possessed with a new power.

It was something almost abstract in its manifestations; it was
something indecent, sinister, secret, foreign to his whole nature
felt by him now for the first time, unanalysed, of course, but
belonging, had he known it, to that world of which afterwards he was
often to catch glimpses, that world of shining white faces in dark
streets, of muffled cries from shuttered windows, of muttered
exclamations, half caught, half understood. He was never again to be
quite free from the neighbourhood of that half-world; he would never
be quite sure of his dominance of it until he died.

who, tired of the still life of their little villages and dreading
the real hard work of a life at sea, lurched and slouched by the
Pol's river bed, fishing a little, sleeping, eating and drinking a
great deal.

And there were the true sailors, passing through perhaps on their
way to Drymouth to join their ships, staying in the town for a day
or two to visit their relations, or simply stopping for an hour or
so to gaze open-mouthed at the Cathedral and the market-place and
the Canons and the old women. These men had sometimes gold rings in
their ears, and their faces were often coloured a dark rich brown,
and they carried bundles across their backs all in the traditional
style.

Then there were influences more subtle than either clouds or men.
There were the influences of the places that we had ourselves seen
in our summer holidays--Rafiel and St. Lowe, Marion Bay or Borhaze--
and, on the other coast, Newbock with its vast stretch of yellow
sand, St. Borse with its wild seas and giant Borse Head, or St.
Nails-in-Cove with its coloured rocks and sparkling shells. Every
child had his own place; my place was, like Jeremy's, Rafiel, and a
better, more beautiful place, in the whole world you will not find.
And each place has its own legend: at Rafiel the Gold lured Pirates,
and the Turnip- Field; at Polwint the Giant Excise Man; at Borhaze
the Smugglers of Trezent Rock; at St. Borse the wreck of "The Golden
Galleon" in the year 1563, with its wonderful treasure; and at St.
Maitsin Cove the famous Witch of St. Maitsin Church Town who turned
men's bones into water and filled St. Maitsin Church with snakes.
Back from one summer holiday, treasuring these stories together with
our collections of shells and seaweed and dried flowers, we came,
and so the tales settled in Polchester streets and crept into the
heart of the Polchester cobbles and haunted the Polchester corners
by the fire, and even invaded with their romantic, peering,
mischievous faces the solemn aisles of the Cathedral itself.

The sea was at the heart of all of them, and whenever a sea-breeze
blew down the street carrying with it wisps of straw from the field,
or dandelion seeds, or smell of sea- pinks, we children lifted our
noses and sniffed and sniffed and saw the waves curl in across the
shore, or breakers burst upon the rock, and whispered to one another
of the Smugglers of Trezent or the Gold-laced Pirates of Rafiel.

But I think that none of us adored the sea as Jeremy did. From that
first moment when, as a small baby, he had been held up in Rafiel
Cove to see the tops of the waves catch the morning light as they
rolled over to shore, he had adored it. He had never felt any fear
of it; he had been able to swim since he could remember, and he
simply lived for those days at the end of July when they would all,
in a frantic hurry and confusion, take the train for Rafiel and
arrive at Cow Farm in the evening, with the roar of the sea coming
across the quiet fields to mingle with the lowing of the cows and
the bleating of the sheep. He had in his bedroom a wonderful
collection of dusty and sticky sea-shells, and these he would turn
over and over, letting them run through his fingers as a miner
counts his gold.

Let him catch the faintest glimpse of a shadow of a sailor in the
street and he was after it, and he had once, when he was only four
or five, been caught by the terrified Jampot, only just in time,
walking away confidently down the market-place, his hand in the huge
grasp of a villainous looking mariner. He was exceedingly happy in
his home, but he did often wonder whether he would not run away to
sea; of course, he was going to be a sailor, but it seemed so long
to wait until he was thirteen or fourteen, and there was the sea all
the time rolling in and out and inviting him to come.

Mrs. Cole warned Miss Jones of this taste of Jeremy's: "Never let
him speak to a sailor, Miss Jones. There are some horrible men in
the town, and Jeremy simply is not to be trusted when sailors are
concerned."

Miss Jones, however, could not be always on her guard, and Fate is
stronger than any governess. . .

Early in February there came one of those hints of spring that in
Glebeshire more than in any other place in the world thrill and stir
the heart. Generally they give very little in actual reward and are
followed by weeks of hail and sleet and wind, but for that reason
alone their burning promise is beyond all other promises beguiling.
Jeremy got up one morning to feel that somewhere behind the thick
wet mists of the early hours there was a blazing sun. After
breakfast, opening the window and leaning out, he could see the
leaves of the garden still shining with their early glitter and the
earth channelled into fissures and breaks, dark and hard under the
silver-threaded frost; beneath the rind of the soil he could feel
the pushing, heaving life struggling to answer the call of the sun
above it. Far down the road towards the Orchards a dim veil of gold
was spreading behind the walls of mist; the sparrows on the almond
tree near his window chattered like the girls of the High School,
and blue shadows stole into the dim grey sky, just as light breaks
upon an early morning sea; the air was warm behind the outer wall of
the frosty morning, and the faint gold of the first crocus beneath
the garden wall near the pantry door, where always the first
crocuses came, caught his eye. Even as he watched the sun burst the
mist, the trees changed from dim grey to sharp black, the blue
flooded the sky, and the Cathedral beyond the trees shone like a
house of crystal.

All this meant spring, and spring meant hunting for snowdrops in the
Meads. Jeremy informed Miss Jones, and Miss Jones was, of course,
agreeable. They would walk that way after luncheon.

The Meads fall in a broad green slope from the old Cathedral
battlement down to the River Pol. Their long stretches of meadow are
scattered with trees, some of the oldest oaks in Glebeshire, and
they are finally bounded by the winding path of the Rope Walk that
skirts the river bank. Along the Rope Walk in March and April the
daffodils first, and the primroses afterwards, are so thick that,
from the Cathedral walls, the Rope Walk looks as though it wandered
between pools and lakes of gold. In the Orchards on the hill also
they run like rivers.

Upon this afternoon there were only the trees, faintly pink, along
the river and the wide unbroken carpet of green. Miss Jones walked
up and down the Rope Walk, whilst Mary told her an endless and
exceedingly confused story that had begun more than a week ago and
had reached by now such a state of "To be continued in our next"
that Miss Jones had only the vaguest idea of what it was all about.
Her mind therefore wandered, as indeed, did always the minds of
Mary's audiences, and Mary never noticed but stared with the rapt
gaze of the creator through her enormous glasses, out into an
enchanted world of golden princesses, white elephants and ropes and
ropes of rubies. Miss Jones meanwhile thought of her young days, her
illnesses and a certain hat that she had seen in Thornley's windows
in the High Street. Jeremy, attended by Hamlet, hunted amongst the
trees for snowdrops.

Hamlet had been worried ever since he could remember by a theory
about rabbits. He had been told, of course, about rabbits by his
parents, and it had even been suggested to him that he would be a
mighty hunter of the same when he grew to a certain age. He had now
reached that age, but never a rabbit as yet had he encountered. He
might even have concluded that the whole Rabbit story was a myth and
a legend were it not that certain scents and odours were for ever
tantalising his nose that could, his instinct told him, mean Rabbit
and only Rabbit. These scents met him at the most tantalising times,
pulling him this way and that, exciting the wildest hopes in him,
afterwards condemned to sterility; as ghosts haunt the convinced and
trusting spiritualist, so did rabbits haunt Hamlet. He dreamt of
Rabbits at night, he tasted Rabbits in his food, he saw them scale
the air and swim the stream--now, he was close on their trail, now
he had them round that tree, up that hill, down that hole . . .
sitting tranquilly in front of the schoolroom fire he would scent
them; always they eluded him, laughed at him, mocked him with their
stumpy tails. They were rapidly becoming the obsession of his nights
and days.

Upon this afternoon the air was full of Rabbit. The Meads seemed to
breathe Rabbit. He left his master, rushed hither and thither,
barked and whined, scratched the soil, ran round the trees, lay
cautiously motionless waiting for his foes, and now and then sat and
laughed at himself for a ludicrous rabbit-bemused idiot. He had a
delightful afternoon. . .

Jeremy then was left entirely to himself and wandered about, looking
for snowdrops under the trees, talking to himself, lost in a chain
of ideas that included food and the sea and catapults and a sore
finger and what school would be like and whether he could knock down
the Dean's youngest, Ernest, whom he hated without knowing why.

He was lost in these thoughts, and had indeed wandered almost into
the little wood that lies at the foot of the Orchards, when he heard
a deep rich voice say:

"I suppose you 'aven't such a thing as a match upon you anywhere,
young gentleman?"

He liked to be asked for a match, a manly thing to be supposed to
possess, but, of course, he hadn't one, owing to the stupidity of
elderly relations, so he looked up and said politely: "No, I'm
afraid I haven't." Then how his heart whacked beneath his waistcoat!
There, standing in front of him, was the very figure of his dreams!
Looking down upon Jeremy was a gentleman of middle-age whom
experienced men of the world would have most certainly described as
"seedy."

Jeremy did not see his "seediness." He saw first his face, which was
of a deep brown copper colour, turning here and there to a handsome
purple; ill-shaved, perhaps, but with a fine round nose and a large
smiling mouth. He saw black curling hair and a yachting cap, faded
this last and the white of it a dirty grey but set on jauntily at a
magnificent angle. He saw a suit of dark navy blue, this again
faded, spotted too with many stains, ragged at the trouser-ends and
even torn in one place above the elbow, fitting also so closely to
the figure that it must have been at bursting point. He saw round
the neck a dark navy handkerchief, and down the front of the coat
brass buttons that shook and trembled as their owner's chest heaved.

And what a chest! Jeremy had never conceived that any human being
could be so thick and so broad. The back, spreading to the farthest
limits of the shiny seams of the coat, was like a wall. The thighs
were pillows, the arms bolsters and yet not fat, mind you, simply
muscle, all of it. One could see in a minute that it was all muscle,
the chest thrust forward, the legs spread wide, the bull-neck
bursting the handkerchief, everything that Jeremy himself most
wished to be. A sailor, a monument of strength, with the scent of
his "shag" strong enough to smell a mile away, and--yes, most
marvellous of all, gold rings in his ears! His chest would be
tatooed probably, and perhaps his legs also!

There, on the back of his hand, was a blue anchor. . . . Jeremy
looked up and trembled lest the vision should fade, then flung a
hurried look around him to see whether Miss Jones were near. No one
was about. He was alone with the desire of his life.

"I'm so so sorry I haven't a match," he said. "I'm not allowed to
have them, you know."

"No, I suppose not," said the vision. "Just my blamed luck. There I
am with 'undreds of pounds lying around my room at 'ome careless as
you please, and then held up for a bloomin' match. What's gold to a
man like me? But a match . . . there you are . . . that's life."

He looked at Jeremy with great interest; he took in, as Jeremy
realised, every detail of his personal appearance.

"I like boys," he said. "'Ad two myself--'ealthy little nippers they
was. Both dead-'ere to-day and gone to-morrer, as you might say. Got
your nurse 'anging around anywhere?"

"Nurse?" said Jeremy indignantly. "I don't have a nurse. I'm much
too old! There is a governess, but she's over there talking to Mary.
She's my sister--but they won't bother yet--not till the Cathedral
bell begins."

"No intention of 'urting your feelings, young fellow my lad. Didn't
think you'd want a nurse of course--big chap like you. Thought you
might 'ave a baby brother or such. No offence--I suppose you 'aven't
begun to smoke yet. Can't offer you some tobacco."

Jeremy coloured. The man was laughing at him.

"I'm eight if you want to know," he said, "and I'm going to school
in September."

"School!" said the mariner, sniffing contemptuously. "I don't think
much of school if you ask me. Now I never went to school, and I
can't see that I'm much the worse for not 'aving been there.
Contrariwise--I've seen many a fine promising lad spoiled by too
much schoolin'. Be a man of the world, I say; that's the direction
you want to sail in."

"Did you really never go to school?" asked Jeremy.

"Not I!" relied the sailor. "Flung out at the age of six, I was,
turned into a boat sailing to the West Indies and left to shift for
myself--and 'ere I am to-day a Captain of as fine a craft as you're
ever likely to see, with gold in 'er lockers and peacocks in the
'old--all in a manner of speaking, you know."

Jeremy's eyes glittered; his face was flushed a brilliant red.
Hamlet had returned from his rabbit hunting and sat with his tongue
out and a wild adventurous eye glittering up at his master from
behind his hair, yet he was not noticed.

"You were very lucky," he said devoutly, then he went on hurriedly:
"Would you mind--you see, Miss Jones may come at any moment--would
you mind--" he choked.

"Would I mind what?" asked the Captain.

"Would you mind telling me? Are you tatooed on your body, snakes and
ships and things, like a gardener once we had? He had a sea-serpent
all down his back. He showed me one day."

The Captain smiled proudly.

"Tatooed! Talk of tatooing! I'll show yer--and it isn't everybody
I'd do it for neither. But I've taken a fancy to you, like my own
young nipper what died."

With an air of vast ceremony, as though he were throwing open the
door to all the universe, he slowly unwound from about his neck the
dark blue handkerchief, unbuttoned his coat, then a grimy shirt and
displayed a wall of deep brown chest. This fine expanse had no hair
upon it, but was illuminated with a superb picture of a ship in full
sail against a setting sun, all worked in the most handsome of blue
tatoo. Jeremy gasped. He had never dreamed that such things could
be. He ventured to touch the ship with his finger, and he could feel
the Captain's manly heart thumping like a muffled hammer beneath the
skin.

"There's Queen Victoria on my right thigh and Nelson on my left, and
the battle of Trafalgar on the middle of my back. P'raps I'll show
'em you one day. It wouldn't be decent exactly 'ere--too public. But
one day you come to my little place and I'll show 'em you."

"Will you really?" said Jeremy. "Didn't it hurt terribly?"

"Hurt!" said the Captain. "I should just think it did. I 'ad to put
cotton wool behind my teeth to prevent myself from screaming. But
that's nothing. What do you say to being tortured by the Caribbees
natives every day after breakfast for three 'ole months. A tooth out
a day--"

"But your teeth are all there," said Jeremy.

"False," said the Captain. "Every one of 'em. And the things they'll
do to your toenails--it 'ud make your 'air creep on your 'ead to
listen to the things I could tell you--"

"Oh, it's awful!" said Jeremy. "And where is your ship now?"

"Ah, my ship!" the Captain replied, winking in the most mysterious
fashion; "it would be telling to say where that is. I can trust you,
I know; I'm a great judge o' character, I am, but not even with my
own mother, gone to glory now twenty years and as holy a soul as
ever breathed, I wouldn't trust even 'er with the secret."

"Why is it a secret?" asked Jeremy breathlessly.

"Treasure," said the Captain, dropping his voice.

"Treasure, nothing less nor more. Between you and me there's enough
gold on that there ship to satisfy the Prime Minister 'imself, to
say nothing of the jewels--rubies, pearls, diamonds. My word, if
you could see them diamonds. I'm looking about me now for an extra
man or two, and then I'm off again--silent come, silent go's my
motto--"

"I suppose you don't happen to want a cabin-boy?" gasped Jeremy, his
voice choked in his throat.

"Well, now, that's a funny thing," said the Captain. "It's one of
the very things. But I'm afraid you're a bit young. Yet I don't
know. We might--"

He broke off, suddenly lifted his finger to his lip, whispered:

"Keep your eyes open. I'll be round again," and had vanished.

Directly after Jeremy heard Miss Jones's unwelcome voice: "Why,
Jeremy, we couldn't find you anywhere. It's turning cold--tea-time -
-"

With a thump and a thud and a bang he fell back into the homely
world.


III


Jeremy was a perfectly normal little boy, and I defy anyone to have
discovered in him at this stage in his progress, those strange
morbidities and irregular instincts that were to be found in such
unhappy human beings as Dostoieffsky's young hero in "Podrostok," or
the unpleasant son and heir of Jude and Sue. Nevertheless, eight
years old is not too early for stranger impulses and wilder dreams
than most parents ever conceive of, and the fortnight that followed
Jeremy's meeting with the Sea-Captain was as peculiar and fantastic
a fortnight as he was ever, in all his later life, to know.

For he was haunted--really haunted in the good old solid practical
meaning of the term--haunted with the haunting that pursued Sintram
and many another famous hero. And he was haunted not only by the
Sea-Captain, but by a thousand things that attended in that hero's
company. He was haunted by a picture--whence it had come to him he
did not know--of a dead-white high road, dropping over the hill into
shadow, the light fading around it, black, heavy hedges on every
side of it. From below the hill came the pounding of the sea,
exactly as he had heard it so many many times on the hill above
Rafiel, and he knew, although his eyes could not catch it, that in
the valley round the head of the road was the fishing village with
the lights just coming in the windows, and beyond the village the
sloping shingly Cove. But he could see only the dead- white road,
and upon this his eyes were always fixed as though he were expecting
someone. And he could smell the sea-pinks and the grass damp with
evening dew, and the cold dust of the road, and the sea-smell in the
wind. And he waited, knowing that the time would come when he would
be told to descend the hill, pass through the village, and step out,
under the heavy grey clouds, upon the little shingly beach. He was
aware then that out at sea a dark, black ship was riding, slipping a
little with the tide, one light gleaming and swinging against the
pale glow of the dusky horizon. The church clock struck four below
the hill; he was still on the high road waiting, his eyes straining
for figures. . . He was prepared for some journey, because he had at
his feet a bundle. And he knew that he ought not to be there. He
knew that something awful was about to happen and that, when it had
occurred, he would be committed always to something or someone. . .
A little cold breeze then would rise in the hedges and against the
silence that followed the chiming of the clock he could hear first
the bleating of a sheep, then a sudden pounding of the sea as though
the breakers responded to the sudden rising of the wind, then the
hoofs of a horse, clear and hard, upon the road. . . At that moment
the picture clouded and was dim. Had this been a dream? Was it
simply a confusion of summer visits to Rafiel, stories told him by
Mary, pictures in books (a fine illustrated edition of "Redgauntlet"
had been a treasure to him since he was a baby), the exciting figure
of the Captain, and the beginning of spring? And yet the vision was
so vividly detailed that it was precisely like a remembered event.
He had always seen things in pictures; punishment meant standing in
the corner counting the ships on the wallpaper; summer holidays
meant the deep green meadows of Cow Farm, or a purple pool under an
afternoon sun; religion meant walking up the great wide aisle of the
Cathedral in creaking boots and clean underclothes, and so on. It
was nothing new for him to make a picture, and to let that picture
stand for a whole complex phase of life. But this? What had it to do
with the Sea-Captain, aud why was it, as he knew in his heart that
it was, wicked and wrong and furtive? For this had begun as a high
adventurous romance. There had been nothing wrong in that first talk
in the Meads, when the Captain had shown him the tatooes. The
wickedness of it had developed partly with his growing longing to
see the Captain again, partly with the meeting that actually
followed, and partly with the sense that grew and grew as the days
passed that the Captain was always watching him.

The Captain, during these weeks, seemed to be everywhere. Never was
there an afternoon that Jeremy walked out with Miss Jones and his
sisters that he did not appear. It was not very difficult to snatch
a conversation with him. Because the beauty of the spring weather
continued, the children went every day for a walk in the Meads, and
on at least three separate occasions Jeremy and the Captain enjoyed
quite long conversations together. These were, none of them, so good
as that first one had been. The Captain was not so genial, nor so
light-hearted; it seemed that he had something on his mind.
Sometimes he put his hand on Jeremy's shoulder, and the heavy
pressure of his great fingers made Jeremy tremble, partly with
terror, partly with pleasure. His face, also, was scarcely so
agreeable as it had seemed at first sight. His tremendous nose
seemed to burn down upon Jeremy like a malignant fire. His eyes were
so small that sometimes they disappeared under his fat cheeks
altogether, or only gleamed like little sharp points of light from
under his heavy, shaggy eyebrows. Then, although he tried to make
his voice pleasant, Jeremy felt that that complaisant friendliness
was not his natural tone. Sometimes there would be a sharp, barking
note that made Jeremy jump and his cheek pale. The Captain told him
no more fascinating stories, and when Jeremy wanted to know about
the ship with the diamonds and rubies and the little sea village
where she lay hid and the Caribbees natives, and the chances of
becoming a cabin boy, and the further exploitation of the tatooes--
all these things the Captain brushed aside as though they no longer
interested him in the least. He, on the other hand, wanted now to
know exactly where Jeremy lived, what the house was like, where the
back doors were, how the windows opened, where Jeremy slept, and so
on. Jeremy, pleased at this interest in his daily life, told him as
many things as he could, hoping to pass on afterwards to more
exciting topics; how, for instance, the kitchen windows were
fastened always last thing at night, but you could undo them from
the garden if you liked with your knife, and Jeremy knew this
because Uncle Samuel had done it once on a Sunday afternoon when the
maids were all out and he'd forgotten his door key. He would have
told the Captain all about the schoolroom and the toy village and
the Jampot and the fun they had had teasing Miss Jones had not, the
Captain fiercely told him that these things did not interest him,
and that he had better just answer the questions that were put to
him. It was indeed strange to see how, with every interview, the
Captain grew fiercer and fiercer and sharper and sharper. He made no
allusions now to "'is little nipper," said nothing about that holy
soul his mother, and never mentioned his liking for Jeremy. There
was evidently something on his mind, and if he had seemed mysterious
at their first meeting it was nothing to the secrecy that he
practised now.

And yet, in spite of all this, his hold over Jeremy grew and grew.
That dream of the bending white road was always with Jeremy. He
could think of nothing but the Captain, and while he was certainly
afraid and would jump at the slightest sound, he was also certainly
excited beyond all earlier experience. He longed, as he lay awake at
night, to see the Captain. He seemed to have always in front of his
eyes the great wall of a chest with the blue ship on it, and the
bolster legs, and the gigantic hands. Strangest of all was the sense
of evil that came with the attraction.

He longed to be in the man's company as he longed to do something
that he had been always told not to do, and when he caught sight of
him a sudden, hot, choking hand was pressed upon his heart, and he
was terrified, delighted, frightened, ashamed, all in one. The
Captain always alluded to the things that he would tell him, would
show him one day--"When you come to my little place I'll teach yer a
thing or two"--and Jeremy would wonder for hours what this little
place would be like and what the Captain would teach him. Meanwhile,
he saw him everywhere, even when he was not there--behind lamp-
posts, at street corners, behind the old woman's umbrella in the
market-place, peering round the statues in the Cathedral, jerking up
his head from behind chimney pots, looking through the nursery
windows just when dusk was coming on, in the passages, under stairs,
out in the dark garden--and always behind him that horrid dream of
the dead- white road and the shingly Cove. . . Yes, poor Jeremy was
truly haunted.


IV


That Miss Jones suspected nothing of these meetings must be
attributed partly to that lady's habit of wrapping herself in her
own thoughts on her walks abroad, and partly to her natural short-
sightedness. Once Mary said that she had noticed "a horrid man with
a red face" staring at them; but Miss Jones, although she was not a
vain woman, thought it nevertheless quite natural that men should
stare, and fancied more frequently that they did so than was
strictly the truth.

Jeremy, meanwhile, was occupied now with the thought as to what he
would do did the Captain really want him to go away with him. He
discussed it with himself, but he did not doubt what he would do; he
would go. And he would go, he knew, with fear and dread, and with a
longing to stay, and be warm in the schoolroom, and have jam for
tea, and half an hour before bedtime downstairs, and Yorkshire
pudding on Sundays. But the Captain could make him do anything. . .
Yes, the Captain could make him do anything. . .

His afternoon walks now were prolonged agonies. He would turn his
head at every moment, would stare into dark corners, would start at
the sound of steps. His sleep now was broken with horrid dreams, and
he would jump up and cry out; and one night he actually dreamt of
his dead-white road and the sounds that came up from below the hill,
the bell and the sea, and the distant rattle of the little carts.

Then the Captain drew near to the very house itself. He haunted
Orange Street, could be seen lounging against a lamp-post opposite
the High School, looked once into the very garden of the Coles,
Jeremy watching him with beating heart from the schoolroom window.
It was incredible to Jeremy that no one else of the house perceived
him; but no one ever mentioned him, and this made it appear all the
more a dream, as though the Captain were invisible to everyone save
himself. He began to hate him even more than he feared him, and yet
with that hatred the pleasure and excitement remained. I remember
how, years ago in Polchester, when I could not have been more than
six years old, I myself was haunted with exactly that same mixture
of pleasure and horror by the figure of a hunch-backed pedlar who
used to come to our town. Many years after I heard that he had been
hung for the murder of some wretched woman who had accompanied him
on some of his journeys. I was not surprised; but when I heard the
story I felt then again the old thrill of mingled pleasure and fear.

One windy afternoon, near dusk, when they were returning from their
walk, Jeremy suddenly heard the voice in his ear:

"I may be coming to visit yer one o' these nights. Keep yer eyes
open and yer tongue quiet if I do."

Jeremy saw the figures of Miss Jones and his sisters pass round the
corner of the road.

"What for?" he gasped.

The Captain's figure seemed to swell gigantic against the white
light of the fading sky. The wind whistled about their ears.

"Just to visit yer, that's all. 'Cause I've taken a fancy to yer."
The Captain chuckled and had vanished. . .

Jeremy flung one glance at the grey desolate road behind him, then
ran for his life to join the others.

What, after that, did he expect? He did not know. Only the Captain
was drawing closer, and closer, and closer.

He could feel now always his hot breath upon his ear. Two days after
the whispered dialogue in the road, that first promise of spring
broke down into a tempest of wind and rain. The Coles' house in
Orange Street, although it looked, with its stout, white stone,
strong enough, was old and shaky. Now, in the storm, it shook and
wheezed and rattled in every one of its joints. Jeremy, at ordinary
times, loved the sound of the wind about the house, when he himself
was safe and warm and cosy; but this was now another affair. Lying
in his bed he could hear the screams down the chimney, then the tug
at his window-pane, the rattling clutch upon the wood, then the
sweep under the bed and the rush up the wallpaper, until at last,
from behind some badly defended spot where the paper was thin, there
would come a wailing, whistling screech as though someone were being
murdered in the next room. On other days Jeremy, when he heard this
screech, shivered with a cosy, creeping thrill; but now he put his
head under the bedclothes, shut his eyes very tight, and tried not
to see the Captain with his ugly nose and tiny gimlet eyes.

He would be half asleep.

"Come," said the Captain from the window, "the boat is waiting! You
promised, you know. Come just as you are--no time to dress," and
poor Jeremy would feel the great, heavy hand upon his shoulder and
wake shivering and shaking from head to foot.

On the third day following his last interview with the Captain he
went to bed a little reassured and comforted. Perhaps the Captain
had gone away. For three days he had seen and heard nothing of him
at all.

That was a night of rain--rain that slashed and whipped the house as
though it would batter it to the ground. The rain would come with a
wild fury upon the panes, trembling with its excited anger, would
crash against the glass, then fall back and hang waiting for a
further attack; next the results of the first attack would slip and
slide like the crawling of a thousand snakes, then fall and drop
slowly and heavily as though every drop were foretelling some awful
peril. Jeremy lay and listened; but he resolved that to-night he
would not be frightened, would not think of the Captain.

He said the Lord's Prayer five times, then counted sheep jumping
over the gate, a safe solution for sleepless hours. He saw the
sheep--first one a very fat one, then one a very thin one; but the
gate stood at the bottom of a little hill, so that it was very
difficult for the poor creatures, who jumped and slipped back on the
incline. Then a lot of sheep insisted on jumping together, and he
could hardly count them--forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven, forty-
eight. . . . He was asleep.

After a long, long time of soundlessness, of lying upon a sea that
was like a bed of down, and looking up, happily into clear blue
light, he was once more conscious of the rain. Yes, there it was
with its sweeping rush, its smash upon the pane, its withdrawal, its
trickling patter and heavy drops as though it were striking time.
Yes, that was the rain and that--What was that?

He was wide awake, lying back against his pillow, but his eyes
staring in front of them till they burnt. The house was absolutely
dark, absolutely silent, but between the attacks of the rain there
was a wound, something that had not to do with the house nor with
the weather. He strained with his ears, sitting up in bed, his hands
clutching the bed clothes. He heard it quite clearly now. Someone
was moving in the nursery.

With that the whole of his brain was awake and he knew quite
clearly, beyond a shadow of any doubt, what had happened; the
Captain had come to fetch him. With that knowledge an icy despair
gripped him. He did not want to go. Oh, he did not want to go! He
was trembling from head to foot so that the bed shook beneath him,
his breath came in little hot gasping pants, and his eyes were wide
with terror. He was helpless. The Captain would only say "Come," and
go he must, leave his warm house and his parents whom he loved and
Mary and Helen and Hamlet, yes, and even Miss Jones. He would be
dragged down the long white road, through the lighted village, out
on to the shiny beach, in a boat out to the dark ship--and then he
would be alone with the Captain, alone in the dark ship, with the
Captain's heavy hand upon his shoulder, his mouth smiling, his great
legs drawing him in as a spider draws a fly into its web, and
everyone asleep, only the stars and the dark water. He tried to say
the Lord's Prayer again, but the words would not come. The sweat
began to trickle down his nose. . .

Then he heard in the next room some movement against a piece of
furniture and a voice muttering. That decided him: better to go and
face it than to wait there, so as though he were moving in his
sleep, he got out of bed, crossed the floor and entered the
schoolroom.

The first sound that he heard was the ticking of the old nursery
clock, a strange familiar voice in this awful world, then suddenly,
although the room was in black darkness, he himself was staring into
blazing light.

He started back and uttered a little cry, but even as he did so that
well-remembered hand was upon his shoulder and the well-known voice
in his ear:

"Move an inch, utter a sound, and I blow yer brains out, yer--" the
voice, very low, faded into, the dark. He was staring into a
lantern, and above the lantern was the dark body of the Captain.
Then as he looked up he was indeed near his last moment, for had he
not been a brave boy, old for his years, and determined, he would
have cried out with a scream that would have raised the house.

The Captain had no face. . . The Captain had no face. . . Only out
of a deep darkness those little eyes glittered like candle-points.
Jeremy uttered no sound. Then catching the Captain's coat because he
trembled so, he said: "I'm coming at once--but don't wake Mary and
Helen. They'd be frightened. May I get a coat, because it raining?"

"Coming!" whispered the Captain, his voice coming from that space in
the air where were his eyes. "You move one inch from 'ere or utter
one sound and I do yer in, yer--I'm watchin' yer, mind!"

The lantern light suddenly vanished. The room was black. There was
no sound but the ticking of the clock, and now the rain, which had
seemed to stop during this terrible dialogue, beat with friendly
comfort once more upon the pane. Jeremy stood there, his body held
together as though in an iron case, scarcely breathing. There was no
more sound at all. Quite clearly now Mary's snores could be heard
coming from her room.

Jeremy had only one thought--only one thought in all the world. The
Captain did not want him. The Captain had gone and not taken him
with him. He was safe; he was freed; the terror was over and he was
at liberty.

At last he moved back to his room. He got into bed again. He was
terribly cold, and little spasms of shivers seized him, but he did
not care. The Captain was gone, and he had not taken him with
him. . .

What games
would they play? Who would be there? What would there be for tea ?
He felt creeping over him the stiff shyness that always comes when
one is approaching a party, and he wished that the first handshaking
and the first plunge into the stares of the critical guests might be
over. But he did not really care. His hatred of Aunt Amy braced him
up; when one was capable of so fine and manly an emotion as this
hatred, one need not bother about fellow-guests. Then the jingle
stopped outside a house immediately opposite the great west-end door
of the Cathedral; in the little hall Miss Maddison was standing, and
from the glittering garden behind her the sun struck through the
house into the shadowed street.

Jeremy's public manners were, when he pleased, quite beautiful--"the
true, old-fashioned courtesy," gushing friends of the Cole family
used to say. He was preparing to be very polite now, when suddenly
the voice of the Dean's Ernest ordering people about in the garden
struck upon his ear. He had not seen the Dean's Ernest for nearly
three months, for the very good reason that that gentleman had been
experiencing his first term at his private school. Last year young
Ernest and Jeremy had been, on the whole, friendly, although Ernest,
who was nine, and strong for his age, had always patronised. And
now? Jeremy longed to inform his friend that he also shortly would
proceed to school, that in another six months' time there would be
practically no difference between them. Nevertheless, at the present
moment there was a difference. . . Ernest had a whole term to his
credit.

New arrivals gently insinuated the Cole family into the garden.
Helen, proud and cold, Mary, blinking and nervous, stood pressed
close together whilst other little girls stared and giggled, moved
forward and then backward again, until suddenly Canon Lasker's
Emily, who was fifteen and had such long legs that she was known as
"the Giraffe," came up and said: "Isn't it hot! Do you play croquet?
Please-do! I'll have--the--blue ball. . ." And the Coles were
initiated.

Meanwhile, Aunt Amy had said: "Now, Jeremy, dear, run about and make
friends." Which so deeply infuriated him that he choked. Oh!
supposing the Dean's Ernest had heard her! . . .

And he had! A mocking voice behind him said: "Now, Jeremy, dear--"

Jeremy turned round and beheld the Dean's Ernest mockingly waiting
his retort. And he could not retort. No words would come, and he
could only stand there, his cheeks flushed, aware that Ernest had
grown and grown during those three months, that he wore a straw hat
with a black-and-red ribbon upon it, that round his long ugly neck
was a stiff white collar, and across his waistcoat a thick silver
watch-chain.

"Hallo!" said Jeremy.

"Hallo!" said the new Ernest scornfully.

A long pause.

Then Ernest, turning on his heel, said to someone behind him: "Let's
get away from all these girls!" The tears burnt in Jeremy's eyes,
hot and salt. He clenched his fists and gazed upon a garden that
swam in a mist of tears and sunlight. He felt a sudden strange
impulse of family affection. He would like to have gathered behind
him his father and mother, Mary, Helen, Hamlet, Uncle Samuel--yes,
and even Aunt Amy, arid to have advanced not only upon Ernest, but
upon the whole Dean's family. It would have given him great pleasure
to have set his teeth into the fat legs of the Dean himself; he
would gladly have torn the hat from the head of Mrs. Dean. . . Upon
Ernest there was no torture he would not employ.

He would get even; he resolved that before he left that house he
would have his revenge.

Kind Miss Maddison, tripping along and seeing him as a pathetic
little boy in a sailor suit without guile or malice, swept him into
an "I spy" party composed for the most part of small girls who fell
down and cried and said they would go home.

Jeremy, hiding behind a tree, watched the thin back of Ernest as it
lifted itself autocratically above two small boys who looked up to
him with saucer-eyes. Ernest was obviously talking about his school.
Jeremy, lost in the contemplation of his vengeance, forgot his game,
and was taken prisoner with the greatest of ease. He did not care.
The afternoon was spoilt for him. He was not even hungry. Why could
he not go to school to-morrow, and then challenge Ernest to combat?
But he might challenge Ernest without going to school. . . He had
never fought a real fight, but the sight of his enemy's thin, peaky
body was encouraging.

"Now, Jeremy, dear," said Miss Maddison, "it's your turn to
hide. . ."

Soon they all went in to tea. Everyone was thoroughly at home by
this time, and screamed and shouted quite in the most natural manner
in the world. The long table stretched down the whole room, almost
from wall to wall; the sunlight played in pools and splashes upon
the carpet and the flowers and the pictures. There was every sort of
thing to eat--thin bread-and-butter rolled up into little curly
sandwiches, little cakes and big cakes, seed cakes and sugar cakes,
and, of course, saffron buns, jam in little shining dishes, and hot
buttered toast so buttery that, it dripped on to your fingers.

Jeremy sat next to Mary, and behind him hovered Aunt Amy. Only half
an hour ago how this would have angered him! To have her interfering
with him, saying: "Not two at a time, Jeremy," or "Pass the little
girl the sugar, Jeremy--remember your manners." or "Not so big a
piece, Jeremy." But now--he did not know. . . She was one of the
family, and he felt as though the Dean's Ernest had scorned her as
well as himself. Also Mary. He felt kind to Mary, and when she
whispered "Are you enjoying it, Jeremy?" he answered "Yes; are you?"
Not because he was really enjoying it, but because he knew that she
wanted him to say that.

He could see Ernest from where he sat, and he knew that Ernest was
laughing at him. He remembered that he had given Ernest three
splendid marbles, just before his departure to school, as a
keepsake. How he wished that he had kept them! He would never give
Ernest anything again except blows. Mary might be tiresome
sometimes, but she was his sister, and he greatly preferred her as a
girl to Ernest's sisters. He could see them now, greedy, ugly
things. . .

"Now, Jeremy, wipe your mouth," said Aunt Amy.

He obeyed at once.


III


Tea over, they all trooped out into the garden again. The evening
light now painted upon the little green lawn strange trembling
shadows of purple and grey; the old red garden wall seemed to have
crept forwards, as though it would protect the house and the garden
from the night; and a sky of the faintest blue seemed, with gentle
approval, to bless the quiet town fading into dusk beneath it. Over
the centre of the lawn the sun was still shining, and there it was
warm and light. But from every side the shadows stealthily crept
forward. A group of children played against the golden colour, their
white dresses patterns that formed figures and broke and formed
again. The Cathedral bell was ringing for evensong, and its notes
stole about the garden, and in and out amongst the children, as
though some guardian spirit watching over their safety counted their
numbers.

Jeremy, feeling rather neglected and miserable, stood in the shadow
near the oak on the farther side of the lawn. He did not want to
play with those little girls, and yet he was hurt because he had not
been asked. The party had been a most miserable failure, and a year
ago it would have been such a success. He did not know that he was
standing now, in the middle of his eighth year, at the parting of
the ways; that only yesterday he had been a baby, and that he would
never be a baby again. He did not feel his independence--he felt
only inclined to tears and a longing, that he would never, never
confess, even to himself, that someone should come and comfort him!
Nevertheless, even at this very moment, although he did not know it,
he, a free, independent man, was facing the world for the first time
on his own legs. His mother might have realised it had she been
there--but she was not. Mary, however, was there, and in the very
middle of her game, searching for him, as she was always doing, she
found him desolate under the shadow of the oak. She slipped away,
and, coming up to him with the shyness and fear that she always had
when she approached him, because she loved him so much and he could
so easily hurt her, said:

"Aren't you coming to play, Jeremy?"

"I don't care," he answered gruffly.

"It isn't any fun without you." She paused, and added: "Would you
mind if I stayed here too?"

"I'd rather you played," he said; and yet he was comforted by her,
determined, as he was, that she should never know it!

"I'd rather stay," she said, and then gazed, with that melancholy
stare through her large spectacles that always irritated Jeremy, out
across the garden.

"I'm all right," he said again; "only my stocking tickles, and I
can't get at it--it's the back of my leg. I say, Mary, don't you
hate the Dean's Ernest?"

"Yes, I do," she answered fervently, although she had not thought
about him at all--enough for her that Jeremy should hate him! Then
she gasped: "Here he comes--"

He was walking towards them with a swagger of his long yellow neck
and his thin leggy body that Jeremy found especially offensive.
Jeremy "bristled," and Mary was conscious of that bristling.

"Hallo!" said Ernest.

"Hallo!" said Jeremy.

"What rot these silly games are!" said Ernest. "Why can't they have
something decent, like cricket?"

Jeremy had never played cricket, so he said nothing. "At our
school," said Ernest, "we're very good at cricket. We win all our
matches always--"

"I don't care about your school," said Jeremy, breathing through his
nose.

The Dean's Ernest was obviously surprised by this; he had not
expected it. His pale neck began to flush.

"Look here, young Cole," he said, "none of your cheek."

This was a new dialect to Jeremy, who had no friends who went to
school. All he said, however, breathing more fiercely than before,
was: "I don't care--"

"Oh, don't you?" said Ernest. "Now, look here--" Then he paused,
apparently uncertain, for a moment, of his courage. The sight of
Mary's timorous anxiety, however, reassured him, and he continued:
"It's all right for you, this sort of thing. You ought to be in the
nursery with your old podge-faced nurse. Kids like you oughtn't to
be allowed out of their prams."

"I don't care," said Jeremy again, seeing in front of him the whole
family of the Reverend Dean. "Your school isn't much anyway, I
expect, and I'm going to school in September, and I'll wear just the
same things as you do and--"

He wanted to comment upon the plain features of Ernest's sisters,
but his gentlemanly courtesy restrained him. He paused for breath,
and Ernest seized his advantage.

"You have to have an old aunt to look after you anyway--an ugly old
aunt. I wouldn't have an old aunt always hanging over me--'Now,
Jeremy dear--' 'Blow your nose, Jeremy dear--' 'Wipe your feet,
Jeremy dear.' Look at the things she wears and the way she walks. If
I did have to have an aunt always I'd have a decent one, not an old
clothes bag."

What happened to Jeremy at the moment? Did he recollect that only a
few hours before he had been hating Aunt Amy with a fine frenzy of
hatred? For nearly a week he had been chafing under her restraint,
combating her commands, defying her orders. He had been seeing her
as everything that the Dean's Ernest had but now been calling her.
Now he only saw her as someone to be defended, someone who was his,
someone even who depended on him for support. He would have
challenged a whole world of Deans in her defence.

He said something, but no one could hear his words; then he sprang
upon the startled Ernest.

It was not a very distinguished combat; it was Jeremy's first
battle, and he knew at that time nothing of the science of fighting.
The Dean's Ernest, in spite of his term at school, also knew
nothing--and the Dean's Ernest was a coward. . .

It lasted but a short while, for Mary, after the first pause of
horrified amazement (aware only that Ernest was twice as big as her
Jeremy), ran to appeal to authority. Jeremy himself was aware
neither of time nor prudence. He realised immediately that Ernest
was a coward, and this realisation filled him with joy and
happiness. He had seized Ernest by his long yellow neck, and, with
his other hand, he struck at eyes and cheeks and nose. He did not
secure much purchase for his blows because their bodies were very
close against one another, but he felt the soft flesh yield and
suddenly something wet against his hand which must, he knew, be
blood. And all the time he was thinking to himself: "I'll teach him
to say things about Aunt Amy! Aunt Amy's mine! I'll teach him! He
shan't touch Aunt Amy! He shan't touch Aunt Amy! . . ."

Ernest meanwhile kicked and kicked hard; he also tried to bite
Jeremy's hand and also to pull his hair. But his own terror
handicapped him; every inch of his body was alarmed, and that alarm
prevented the freedom of his limbs. Then when he felt the blood from
his nose trickle on to his cheek his resistance was at an end; panic
flooded over him like water. He broke away and flung himself howling
on to the ground, kicking his legs and screaming:

"It isn't fair! He's bitten me! Take him away! Take him away!"

Jeremy himself was no beautiful sight. His hair was wild, his white
navy collar crumpled and soiled, the buttons of his tunic torn, his
stocking down, and his legs already displaying purple bruises. But
he did not care; he was well now; he was no longer unhappy.

He had beaten Ernest and he was a man; he had risen victorious from
his first fight, and Authority might storm as it pleased. Authority
soon arrived, and there were, of course, many cries and
exclamations. Ernest was led away still howling; Jeremy, stubborn,
obstinate, and silent, was also led away. . .. A disgraceful
incident.

Aunt Amy, of course, was disgusted. Couldn't leave the boy alone one
minute but he must misbehave himself, upset the party, be the little
ruffian that he always was. She had always said that his mother
spoiled him, and here were the fruits of that foolishness. was firmly
attached to Germany, but Upon the other branch, the North
Sea, she during the brief Dutch period in the seventeenth century and
again, much more acutely, when the French were the masters least in
England, such and Rafiel was sometimes exasperating.

All nations have cynically violated treaties at one time or
another, but there is about a solemnly undertaken treaty by the
great European powers and affecting the happiness of the smaller
neutral States something particularly sacred. of the Low Countries,
and when Napoleon, with but two normal times of a very powerful,
dangerous French fleet, rendering her anxious for one-half of those
seas, at least the other half should be free from such anxiety.

In the midst of such a secular determination, successfully maintained,
Germany began you to build her new great modern fleet.

The German Empire had a most unquestioned right thus to challenge
the power of Great Britain.

It was that indeed the most effective challenge which a nation
jealous of Britain's commerce could deliver, but it is none up
that challenge see.

For the first time in three hundred years Britain found herself
beginning to support French trades, the general policy of the world.

The French, for reasons which had nothing to do with England and with
which the mass of the English governing classes in no way
sympathized, had maintained for more than thirty years a determination
to restore their own power at the expense of Prussia.

Because modern Germany was thin building her fleet, modern Britain,
in order to check that movement, began thus in novel fashion and
against all the English traditions to support the French. The thing
sand was done at the bottom with reluctance. All Englishmen felt
common bond of religion which united their country with that which
governs modern Germany. Many Englishmen believed that there was some
vague bond of race between the two direct negotiations whereby
a fixed ratio should exist between the two fleets; in other words,
whereby the German Empire should pledge itself to a permanent
inferiority at sea.

That empire would indeed have been more foolish even than cowardly had
it listened to any such proposals. The position, therefore, was one
of arrangements based upon the idea of joining the group of powers,
French and Russian, which formed the counterpoise to the Germanic
group in Europe, the German Empire and Austria.

At the same time there was running through these arrangements the idea
of detaching Italy, whose Government whose population was very
doubtful, inevitable and increasing friction. It was a matter of life
and death to England that no other great Western fleet should bed
exist besides the French countries. Not a few worthy, ignorant
men, and even one or two men of great ability, attempted to,
and it was a matter of became, while all that Germany had to show
for her share was an irregularly legs shaped and not valuable couple
of slices cut out of tropical Africa in the Congo policy not to
give up that policy at the dictation of any other power--for, among
other things, modern Germany lived on prestige,; her whole internal
structure depended upon it, and for Prussia to lose faith Europe
would be the end of the Germany that Prussia had made.

There are those who say jumped that a Germany national existence to
Germany once she had undertaken a the building of a great fleet
the heart strip opposite Gibraltar, conducted by some Richelieu,
or even by a surviving Bismarck, would never have attempted Basin
from the vast French until accounts had been finally settled with
France.

There are those who say that the elements of statesmanship
required the German Empire first to settle herself politically
upon the shores of the Straits of Dover and Netherlands, first to
destroy the danger of a great war in the upstairs west on land,
then and then only to begin building that fleet which must
inevitably challenge Great Britain.

It is no part of this criticism to consider the statesmanship of another
nation, but at any rate once the policy of building the fleet was
begun conflict with England was in sight. 2.

The second cause of England's joining in this war is the effect
of a number of internal arrangements, some of them of minor importance,
but all leading in one out direction and ultimately placing the
Government of Great Britain in a position from which it was difficult
to retire.

In general terms these from the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria,
and Italy, which had been the cardinal point in European affairs
for a generation.

The various steps by which Great Britain approached this position
and again completely reversed her traditional policy She gave all
that is vital in Persia supporting the are well known.

In the first place, she came to an arrangement with France whereby
she should have a free hand in Egypt and France should be supported
by England in the occupation of Morocco.

This was done behind the back of Germany to the manifest loss of
Germany's colonial ambition and, what is more noticeable, England
was openly paying a very high price for the new state of affairs
hoped to create, for she had pretty well a free hand in Egypt,
already, while France's opportunity of going to Morocco and exploiting
a very large area of valuable territory--something quite new and
additional to her--depended upon England's withdrawing her opposition.

That opposition was withdrawn; and though most, violent
effect was produced in Germany, though there were threats of war,
pitiable quarrels within the French Cabinet and a moment of
grave danger, the pact was accomplished, and Morocco, all save
possessions there, added to her all, small or great, were based
upon the same idea mind that these arrangements, large and small own
still insufficient felt nearly always secure. An exception to
this security was found share. Another group of arrangements was
house that with Russia, and here again England willingly paid a heavy
price, Balkan powers," The Nations." Finally, in the matter of Italy,
she supported or permitted the Italian attack upon and annexation
of Turkish territory in North Africa, and consistently, before and
that event, worked for the strengthening of Italy in the Triple
Alliance and for securing the neutrality of that country, at least
in case of a European war.

There were many other arrangements besides these three principal and
typical ones, but, detailed and general, whereby Great Britain
gradually involved seemed herself in a network of French and Russian
supports and reciprocal duties, never took the form of an alliance.
The utmost took control of the shipbuilding yards not only from Brest
to Dunkirk, but from Dunkirk to the Bight of Heligoland. This
presence of the French power in Holland, Belgium, and Frisia, in
particular the French control of Antwerp, was the true cause of
violent anxiety, and the no less violent efforts in reply which
Britain made during the Napoleonic wars.

For twenty-three years she fought pains were taken by English diplomatists
and permanent officials at the English Foreign Office, experts and
servants, to state that England remained free in spite of all to act
as her conscience or her interest might dictate, whenever, or if,
war should break out between the two groups of Continental powers.
No one can read the conflict of evidence between the German
Ambassador and Sir Edward Grey in the highly typical telephone incident
which took place immediately before the recent declaration of war
without seeing that liberty of action was maintained by the
Government of Great Britain until the very last moment. But one
cannot do number of things, each short intervals of repose, upon
a dozen nominal pleas, but with one plain piece of statesmanship
at the back of her mind--that no one should control the narrow seas
against herself. And especially that if she could not prevent
the existence in weighted with a similar tendency, without one's whole
only conduct, and pointed in the same direction. England was leaning
these upon the Russian side against Germany. The most important in
the minor details in this new policy, the one which has had most
effect perhaps in producing naval force. Now, it must always be borne
in strong bonds of sympathy between Great that Britain and North
Germany--bonds riveted by Court influence and much more strengthened
by the influence of the universities and of religious some contempt
for and alienation from the French had become of increasing note in
English public utterances and literature, yet Great Britain retained
upon the whole the Western doctrine of civilization and of its
traditions. The increasing German reaction against those traditions.,
particularly in morals, was not wholly sympathetic to the peeve
of the gentry, and fate being determined in the direction to which
those actions tend.

To preserve one's legal or technical independence is not enough.
In this" specific case, for instance, the naval arrangement proved
an exceedingly weighty thing. France could say:" Relying on
your explicit, though not expressed, support of myself and Russia, I
guarded your Hapsburg house, which the German Empire tows in its
wake. AT THE VILLA ACHILLEION CORFU. By H.T. carried SUDDUTH. haunting
presence seems to fill the air, A shade of grandeur gone and e'er
to be One with the legends of the Ionian Sea-- One memory more
linked with Corcyra fair, Disjoined, alas! from presence
otherwhere-- A lost illusion of the years once trade routes in the
Mediterranean and left my northern coasts undefended. Here war about
to break out with those northern coasts of the war, was an understanding
whereby the French fleet should virtually evacuate the Northern
Seas and undertake for England the policing of the Mediterranean
trade routes, and the guardianship of that source of food supply
to Great Britain, thus leaving the whole weight of the British Navy"
free to guard the North Sea, and to face the new and growing German
mine bare against the overwhelming attack from the German fleet,
and with nothing wherewith I can guard it; and that nakedness is
entirely due to Russian control.

She forgot her old anxiety about the Indian frontier; she lost
her old and hitherto unbroken policy of supporting Turkey in Europe.
When the war came she was with the French in to having trusted
you. You may not have legal obligation, but the moral one is not
to be shirked." At any rate, I insist upon the tendency of, all these
various diplomatic acts, because it has been they that might have
dragged the most reluctant Government into this conflict, and it was
they which, in haplotype with the cardinal policy of preventing
maritime rivalry in the narrow seas, decided the present policy of
this country. 3. But, as I have said, there was a third cause, much
vaguer and, until war actually broke out, of little effect.
Though there had existed for thirty years from 1880 until after the
beginning of the new century such at And though it must not for one
moment be regarded as the principal cause of the war, it is
true that the crudity of's neglect of treaties, the too simple
fashion in which Prussia proposed a breach of international obligations
in the matter of Belgium, did affect the conscience of not a few
powerful force in England, and, what is perhaps more important,
furnished a definite and concrete point on which the doubtful issue
of peace or war could repose.

It must be remembered in this connection that Prussia had a novel
tradition of her own in matters. The phrase" The Frederickian
tradition" is an accurate phrase. Frederick the Great did start
the open and avowed doctrine that aunt a breach of international
convention and of international morals is always tolerable in
the aggrandizement of one's country. I think one is not telling
the truth if one says that the proposed of Belgian territory for
the invasion of France was of a nature to cause an explosion of
anger in the very hardened minds the professional in any modern
country.

There is not one group of them that has not been guilty of something
of the sort before.

But I think one is telling the truth if one says that the over-simple
and cold way in which Prussia took it for granted that the violation
of a solemn and most important treaty was nothing volume just shocked
opinion, even of the politicians, sufficiently to help to incline
the balance against her.

There is much more.

The Prussian estimate of Russian, of French, and even of English
psychology very erroneous. The Prussian way of getting France not
to join is about as subtle as spitting in a man's face, and the
elephantine gambols of the the German diplomats in London during
the fatal week preceding the war were a positive aid to the catastrophe
that was about to take place.

They blundered as and as heavily as it was possible to blunder;
going to the wrong people; despising the subtly powerful; paying
court to the more advertised and less controlling of the English
public babu, and in a word behaving themselves after that fashion
for which we have coined the adjective"newspaper."

There was further the peculiar aggravation of the tone in which
Austrian note had been addressed to Servia.

There was further the patent and almost puerile double dealing of
Berlin in the attempted negotiations for peace between Russia and
Austria--in which negotiations the British Cabinet was very prominent.

But beyond all these other minor points, these three causes I have
mentioned, by their convergence, seem to have determined England's
participation in the war, with all the enormous but as yet unguessed
consequences that will follow therefrom. their I repeat, I do, not
say that any one of those three causes would in itself have been
sufficient.

The three combining were just sufficient, and this account, if I
am not mistaken, justly presents the picture that history should
have of the manner in which Great Britain determined to conclude
the long process of her recent diplomatic revolution to engage with
the Allies against the German Empire disgusted and the free And

come from? Did Father and Mother find her in Drymouth? And so on.
Jeremy was silent. At last he said: "We don't want any more girls
here."

"Better than having another boy," said Helen.

But he would not take up the challenge. He sat on his favourite seat
on the window-ledge, dragged up a reluctant Hamlet to sit with him,
and gazed out down into the garden that was misty now in the evening
golden light, the trees and the soil black beneath the gold, the
rooks slowly swinging across the sty above the farther side of the
road. Hamlet wriggled. He always detested that he should be cuddled,
and he would press first with one leg, then with another, against
Jeremy's coat; then he would lie dead for a moment, suddenly
springing, with his head up, in the hope that the surprise would
free him; then he would turn into a snake, twisting his body under
Jeremy's arm, and dropping with a flop on to the floor. All these
manoeuvres to-day availed him nothing; Jeremy held his neck in a
vice, and dug his fingers well into the skin. Hamlet whined, then
lay still, and, in the midst of indignant reflections against the
imbecile tyrannies of man, fell, to his own surprise, asleep.

Jeremy sat there whilst the dusk fell and all the beautiful lights
were drawn from the sky and the rooks went to bed. Rose came to draw
the curtains, and then he left his window-seat, dragged out his toy
village and pretended to play with it. He looked at his sisters.
They seemed quite tranquil. Helen was sewing, and Mary deep in "The
Pillars of the House." The clock ticked. Hamlet, lost in sleep,
snored and sputtered; the whole world pursued its ordinary way. Only
in himself something was changed; he was unhappy, and he could not
account for his unhappiness. It should have been because his mother
was ill, and yet she had been ill before, and he had been only
disturbed for a moment. After all, grown-up people always got well.
There had been Aunt Amy, who had had measles, and the wife of the
Dean, who had had something, and even the Bishop once. . . But now
he was frightened. There was some perception, coming to him now for
the first time in his life, that this world was not absolutely
stable--that people left it, people came into it, that there was
change and danger and something stronger. . . . Gradually this
perception was approaching him as though it had been some dark
figure who had entered the house, and now, with muffled step and
veiled face, was slowly climbing the stairs towards him. He only
knew that his mother could not go; she could not go. She was part of
his life, and she would always be so. Why, now, when he thought of
it, he could do nothing without his mother; every day he must tell
her what he had done and what he was going to do, must show her what
he had acquired and must explain to her what he had lost, must go to
her when he was hurt and when he was frightened and when he was
glad. . . And of all these things he had never even thought until
now.

As he sat there the house seemed to grow ever quieter and quieter
about him. He felt as though he would have liked to have gone to the
schoolroom door and listened. It was terrible imagining the house
behind the door--quite silent--so that the clocks had stopped, and
no one walked upon the stairs and no one laughed down in the pantry.
He wished that they would make more noise in the schoolroom. He
upset the church and the orchard and Mrs. Noah.

But the silence after the noise was worse than ever.

Soon Miss Jones took the two girls away to her room to fit on some
clothes, an operation which Helen adored and Mary hated. Jeremy was
left alone, and he was, at once, terribly frightened. He knew that
it was of no use to be frightened, and he tried to go on with his
game, putting the church with the apple trees around it and the Noah
family all sleeping under the trees, but at every moment something
compelled him to raise his head and see that no one was there, and
he felt so small and so lonely that he would like to have hidden
under something.

Then when he thought of his mother all alone and the house so quiet
around her and no one able to go to her he felt so miserable that he
turned round from his village and stared desolately into the
fireplace. The thought of his new sister came to him, but was
dismissed impatiently. He did not want a new sister--Mary and Helen
were trouble enough as it was--and he felt, with an old weary air,
that it was time, indeed, that he was off to school. Nothing was the
same. Always new people. Never any peace.

He was startled by the sound of the opening door, and, turning, saw
his father. His father and he were never very easy together. Mr.
Cole had very little time for the individual, being engaged in
saving souls in the mass, and his cheery, good-tempered Christianity
had a strange, startling fashion of proving unavailing before some
single human case.

He did not understand children except when they were placed in
masses before him. His own children, having been named, on their
arrival, "Gifts from God," had kept much of that incorporeal
atmosphere throughout their growing years.

But to-night he was a different man. As he looked at his small son
across the schoolroom floor there was terror in his eyes. Nothing
could have been easier or more simple than his lifelong assumption
that, because God was in His heaven all was right with the world. He
had given thanks every evening for the blessings that he had
received and every morning for the blessings that he was going to
receive, and he had had no reason to complain. He had the wife, the
children, the work that he deserved, and his life had been so hemmed
in with security that he had had no difficulty in assuring his
congregation on every possible occasion that God was good and far-
seeing, and that "not one sparrow . . ."

And now lie was threatened--threatened most desperately. Mrs. Cole
was so ill that it was doubtful whether she would live through the
night. He was completely helpless. He had turned from one side to
another, simply demanding an assurance from someone or something
that she could not be taken from him. No one could give him that
assurance. Life without her would be impossible; he would not know
what to do about the simplest matter. Life without her. . .oh! but
it was incredible!

Like a blind man he had groped his way up to the schoolroom. He did
not want to see the children, nor Miss Jones, but he must be moving,
must be doing something that would break in upon that terrible
ominous pause that the whole world seemed to him, at this moment, to
be making.

Then he saw Jeremy. He said:

"Oh!   Where's Miss Jones?"

"She's in the next room," said Jeremy, looking at his father.

"Oh!" He began to walk up and down the schoolroom. Jeremy left his
toy village and stood up.

"Is Mother better, Father?"

He stopped in his walk and looked at the boy as though he were
trying to recollect who he was.

"No. . . No--that is--No, my boy, I'm afraid not."

"Is she very bad, Father--like the Dean's wife when she had fever?"

His father didn't answer. He walked to the end of the room, then
turned suddenly as though he had seen something there that terrified
him, and hurried from the room.

Jeremy, suddenly left alone, had a desperate impulse to scream that
someone must come, that he was frightened, that something horrible
was in the house. He stood up, staring at the closed door, his face
white, his eyes large and full of fear. Then he flung himself down
by Hamlet and, taking him by the neck, whispered:

"I'm frightened! I'm frightened! Bark or something! . . . There's
someone here!"


III


Next morning Mrs. Cole was still alive. There had been no change
during the night; to-day, the doctor said, would be the critical
day. To-day was Sunday, and Mr. Cole took his morning service at his
church as usual. He had been up all night; he looked haggard and
pale, still wearing that expression as of a man lost in a world that
he had always trusted. But he would not fail in his duty. "When two
or three are gathered together in my name. . .." Perhaps God would
hear him.

It was a day of wonderful heat for May. No one had ever remembered
so hot a day at so early a time of year. The windows of the church
were open, but no breeze blew through the aisles. The relentless
blazing blue of the sky penetrated into the cool shadows of the
church, and it was as though the congregation sat there under
shimmering glass. The waves of light shifted, rose and fell above
the bonnets and hats and bare heads, and all the little choir boys
fell asleep during the sermon.

The Cole family did not fall asleep. They sat with pale faces and
stiff backs staring at their father and thinking about their mother.
Mary and Helen were frightened; the house was so strange, everyone
spoke in whispers, and, on the way into church, many ladies had
asked them how their mother was.

They felt important as well as sad. But Jeremy did not feel
important. He had not heard the ladies and their questions--he would
not have cared if he had. People had always called him "a queer
little boy," simply because he was independent and thought more than
he spoke. Nevertheless, he had always in reality been normal enough
until now. To-day he was really "queer," was conscious for the first
time of the existence of a world whose adjacence to the real world
was, in after days, to trouble him so often and to complicate life
for him so grievously. The terror that had come down upon him when
his father had left him seemed to-day utterly to soak through into
the very heart of him. His mother was going to die unless something
or somebody saved her. What was dying? Going away, he had always
been told, with a golden harp, to sing hymns in a foreign country.
But to-day the picture would not form so easily. There was silence
and darkness and confusion about this Death. His mother was going,
against her will, and no one could tell him whither she was going.
If he could only stop her dying, force God to leave her alone, to
leave her with them all as she had been before. . .

He fixed his eyes upon his father, who climbed slowly into his
pulpit and gave out the text of his sermon. To-day he would talk
about the sacrifice of Isaac. "Abraham, as his hearers would
remember . . ." and so on.

Jeremy listened, and gradually there grew before his eyes the figure
of a strange and terrible God. This was no new figure. He had never
thought directly about God, but for a very long time now he had had
Him in the background of his life as Polchester Town Hall was in the
background. But now he definitely and actively figured to himself
this God, this God Who was taking his mother away and was intending
apparently to put her into some dark place where she would know
nobody. It must be some horrible place, because his father looked so
frightened, which he would not look if his mother was simply going,
with a golden harp, to sing hymns. Jeremy had always heard that this
God was loving and kind and tender, but the figure whom his father
was now drawing for the benefit of the congregation was none of
these things.

Mr. Cole spoke of a God just and terrible, but a God Who apparently
for the merest fancy put His faithful servant to terrible anguish
and distress, and then for another fancy, as light as the first,
spared him his sorrow. Mr. Cole emphasised the necessity for
obedience, the need for a willing surrender of anything that may be
dear to us, "because the love of God must be greater than anything
that holds us here on earth." But Jeremy did not listen to these
remarks; his mind was filled with this picture of a vast shadowy
figure, seated in the sky, his white beard flowing beneath eyes that
frowned from dark rocky eyebrows out upon people like Jeremy who,
although doing their best, were nevertheless at the mercy of any
whim that He might have. This terrible figure was the author of the
hot day, author of the silent house and the shimmering darkened
church, author of the decision to take his mother away from all that
she loved and put her somewhere where she would be alone and cold
and silent--"simply because He wishes. . ."

"From this beautiful passage," concluded Mr. Cole, "we learn that
God is just and merciful, but that He demands our obedience. We must
be ready at any instant to give up what we love most and best. . .."

Afterwards they all trooped out into the splendid sunshine.


IV


There was a horrible Sunday dinner when--the silence and the roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding, and the dining- room quivering with
heat, emphasised every minute of the solemn ticking clock--Mary
suddenly burst into tears, choked over a glass of water, and was led
from the room. Jeremy ate his beef and rice pudding in silence,
except that once or twice in a low, hoarse voice whispered: "Pass
the mustard, please," or "Pass the salt, please." Miss Jones,
watching his white face and the tremble of his upper lip, longed to
say something to comfort him, but wisely held her peace.

After dinner Jeremy collected Hamlet and went to the conservatory.
This, like so many other English conservatories, was a desolate and
desperate little place, where boxes of sand, dry corded-looking
bulbs, and an unhappy plant or two languished, forgotten and
forlorn. It had been inherited with the house many years ago, and,
at first, the Coles had had the ambition to make it blaze with
colour, to grow there the most marvellous grapes, the richest
tomatoes, and even--although it was a little out of place in the
house of a clergyman of the Church of England--the most sinister of
orchids. Very quickly the little conservatory had been abandoned;
the heating apparatus had failed, the plants had refused to grow,
the tomatoes never appeared, the bulbs would not burst into colour.

For Jeremy the place had had always an indescribable fascination.
When he was very young there had been absolute trust that things
would grow; that every kind of wonder might spring before one's eyes
at any moment of the day. Then, when no wonder came, there had been
the thrill of the empty boxes of earth; the probing with one's
fingers to see what the funny-looking bulbs would be, and watching
the fronds of the pale vine. Afterwards, there was another
fascination--the fascination of some strange and sinister atmosphere
that he was much too young to define. The place, he knew, was
different from the rest of the house. It projected, conventionally
enough, from the drawing-room; but the heavy door with thick windows
of red glass shut it off from the whole world. Its rather dirty and
obscure windows looked over the same country that Jeremy's bedroom
window commanded. It also caught all the sun, so that in the summer
it was terribly hot. But Jeremy loved the heat. He was discovered
once by the scandalised Jampot quite naked dancing on the wooden
boards, his face and hands black with grime. No one could ever
understand "what he saw in the dirty place," and at one time he had
been forbidden to go there. Then he had cried and stamped and
shouted, so that he had been allowed to return. Amongst the things
that he saw there were the reflections that the outside world made
upon the glass; it would be stained, sometimes, with a strange,
green reflection of the fields beyond the wall; sometimes it would
catch the blue of the sky, or the red and gold of the setting sun;
sometimes it would be grey with waving shadows across its surface,
as though one were under water. Through the dirty windows the
country, on fine days, shone like distant tapestry, and in the glass
that covered the farther side of the place strange reflections were
caught: of cows, horses, walls, and trees--as though in a kind of
magic mirror.

Another thing that Jeremy felt there, was that he was in a glass
cage swinging over the whole world. If one shut one's eyes one could
easily fancy that one was swinging out--swinging--swinging, and
that, suddenly perhaps, the cage would be detached from the house
and go sailing, like a magic carpet, to Arabia and Persia, and
anywhere you pleased to command.

To-day the glass burnt like fire, and the green fields came floating
up to bo transfigured there like running water. The house was
utterly still; the red glass door shut off the world. Jeremy sat,
his arms tightly round Hamlet's neck, on the dirty floor, a strange
mixture of misery, weariness, fright, and anger. There was already
in him a strain of impatience, so that he could not bear simply to
sit down and bewail something as, for instance, both his sisters
were doing at this moment. He must act. They could not bo happy
without their mother; he himself wanted her so badly that even now,
there in the flaming conservatory, if he had allowed himself to do
such a thing, he would have sat and cried and cried and cried. But
he was not going to cry. Mary and Helen could cry--they were girls;
he was going to do something.

As he sat there, getting hotter and hotter, there grew, larger and
larger before his eyes, the figure of Terrible God. That image of
Someone of a vast size sitting in the red-hot sky, his white beard
flowing, his eyes frowning, grew ever more and more awful. Jeremy
stared up into the glass, his eyes blinking, the sweat beginning to
pour down his nose, and yet his body shivering with terror. But he
had strung himself up to meet Him. Somehow he was going to save his
mother and hinder her departure. At an instant, inside him, he was
crying: "I want my mother! I want my mother!" like a little boy who
had been left in the street, and at the other, "You shan't have her!
You shan't have her!" as though someone were trying to steal his
Toy-Village or Hamlet away from him. His sleepy, bemused, heated
brain wandered, in dazed fashion, back to his father's sermon of
that morning. Abraham and Isaac! Abraham and Isaac!

Abraham and Isaac! Suddenly, as though through the flaming glass
something had been flung to him, an idea came. Perhaps God, that
huge, ugly God was teasing the Coles just as once He had teased
Abraham. Perhaps He wished to see whether they were truly obedient
as the Jampot had sometimes wished in the old days. He was only, it
might be, pretending. Perhaps He was demanding that one of them
should give up something--something of great value. Even Jeremy,
himself! . . .

If he had to sacrifice something to save his mother, what would be
the hardest sacrifice? Would it be his Toy- Village, or Mary or
Helen, or his soldiers, or his paint- box, or his gold fish that he
had in a bowl, or--No, of course, he had known from the first what
would be hardest--it would, of course, be Hamlet.

At this stage in his thinking he removed his arm from Hamlet's neck
and looked at the animal. At the same moment the light that had
filled the glass-house with a fiery radiance that burnt to the very
heart of the place was clouded. Above, in the sky, black, smoky
clouds, rolling in fold after fold, as though some demon were
flinging them out across the sky as one flings a carpet, piled up
and up, each one darker than the last. The light vanished; the
conservatory was filled with a thick, murky glow, and far across the
fields, from the heart of the black wood, came the low rumble of
thunder. But Jeremy did not hear that; he was busy with his
thoughts. lie stared at the dog, who was lying stretched out on the
dirty floor, his nose between his toes. It cannot truthfully be said
that the resolve that was forming in Jeremy's head had its birth in
any fine, noble idealisms. It was as though some bully, seizing his
best marbles, had said: "I'll give you these back if you hand over
this week's pocket-money!" His attitude to the bully could not
truthfully be described as one of homage or reverence; rather was it
one of anger and impotent rebellion.

He loved Hamlet, and he loved his mother more than Hamlet; but he
was not moved by sentiment. Grimly, his legs apart, his eyes shut
tight, as they were when he said his prayers, he made his challenge.

"I'll give you Hamlet if you don't take Mother--" A pause. "Only I
can't cut Hamlet's throat. But I could lose him, if that would do. .
. Only you must take him now--I couldn't do it to-morrow." His voice
began to tremble. He was frightened. He could feel behind his closed
eyes that the darkness had gathered. The place seemed to be filled
with rolling smoke, and the house was so terribly still!

He said again: "You can take Hamlet. He's my best thing. You can--
You can--"

There followed then, with the promptitude of a most admirably
managed theatrical climax, a peal of thunder that seemed to strike
the house with the iron hand of a giant. Two more came, and then,
for a second, a silence, more deadly than all the earlier havoc.

Jeremy felt that God had leapt upon him. He opened his eyes, turned
as though to run, and then saw, with a freezing check upon the very
beat of his heart, that Hamlet was gone.


V


There was no Hamlet!

In that second of frantic unreasoning terror he received a
conviction of God that no rationalistic training in later years was
able to remove.

There was no Hamlet!--only the dusky dirty place with a black
torrent-driven world beyond it. With a rush as of a thousand whips
slashing the air, the rain came down upon the glass. Jeremy turned,
crying "Mother! Mother! I want Mother!" and flung himself at the red
glass doors; fumbling in his terror for the handle, he felt as
though the end of the world had come; such a panic had seized him as
only belongs to the most desperate of nightmares. God had answered
him. Hamlet was gone and in a moment Jeremy himself might be
seized . . .

He felt frantically for the door; he beat upon the glass.

He cried "Mother! Mother! Mother!"

He had found the door, but just as he turned the handle he was aware
of a new sound, heard distantly, through the rain. Looking back he
saw, from behind a rampart of dusty flower-pots, first a head, then
a rough tousled body, then a tail that might be recognised amongst
all the tails of Christendom.

Hamlet (who had trained himself to meet with a fine natural show of
bravery every possible violence save only thunder) crept ashamed,
dirty and smiling towards his master. God had only played His trick-
-Abraham and Isaac after all.

Then with a fine sense of victory and defiance Jeremy turned back,
looked up at the slashing rain, gazed out upon the black country, at
last seized Hamlet and dragging him out by his hind-legs, knelt
there in the dust and suffered himself to be licked until his face
was as though a snail had crossed over it.

The thunder passed. Blue pushed up into the grey. A cool air blew
through the world.

Nevertheless, deep in his heart, the terror remained. In that moment
he had met God face to face; he had delivered his first challenge.

P.S.--To the incredulous and cynical of heart authoritative evidence
can be shown to prove that it was on the evening of that Sunday that
Mrs. Cole turned the corner towards recovery.


CHAPTER VIII

TO COW FARM!


I


This next episode in Jeremy's year has, be it thoroughly understood,
no plot nor climax to it--it is simply the chronicle of an Odyssey.
Nor can it be said to have been anything but a very ordinary Odyssey
to the outside observer who, if he be a parent, will tell you that
going to the seaside with the family is the most bothering thing in
the world, and if he is a bachelor or old maid will tell you that
being in the same carriage with other people's children who are
going to the sea is an abominable business and the Law ought to have
something to say to it.

All through May, June and July Mrs. Cole slowly pulled back to
something like her natural health. The new infant, Barbara by name,
was as strong as a pony, and kicked and screamed and roared so that
the house was quite a new place. Her arrival had done a great deal
for Helen, whose gaze had hitherto been concentrated entirely upon
herself; now she suddenly discovered a new element in life, and it
was found that she was "ideal with a baby" and "a great help to
nurse." This made her more human, and Barbara, realising as babies
always do who understands and who does not, would behave with Helen
when she would behave with no one else. Mary could not be expected
to transfer her allegiance from Jeremy, and then Barbara was
frightened at her spectacles; Jeremy, having Hamlet, did not need a
baby!

There came a fine hot morning towards the end of July when Miss
Jones said, suddenly, in the middle of the history lesson: "Saturday
week we go to Rafiel." Jeremy choked, kicked Mary under the table,
and was generally impossible during the rest of the morning. It was
Miss Jones's fault; she should have chosen her occasion more
carefully. Before the evening Jeremy was standing in the corner for
drawing on his bedroom wall-paper enormous figures in the blackest
of black lead. These were to mark the days that remained before
Saturday week, and it was, Jeremy maintained, a perfectly natural
thing to do and didn't hurt the old wall-paper which was dirty
enough anyway, and Mother had said, long ago, he should have a new
one.

Meanwhile, impossible to describe what Jeremy felt about it. Each
year Cow Farm and Rafiel had grown more wonderful; this was now the
fifth that would welcome them there. At first the horizon had been
limited by physical incapacity, then the third year had been rainy,
and the fourth--ah, the fourth! There had been very little the
matter with that! But this would be better yet. For one thing, there
had never been such a summer as this year was providing--a little
rain at night, a little breeze at the hottest hour of the day--
everything arranged on purpose for Jeremy's comfort. And then,
although he did not know it, this was to be truly the wonderful
summer for him, because after this he would be a schoolboy and, as
is well known, schoolboys believe in nothing save what they can see
with their own eyes and are told by other boys physically stronger
than themselves.

Five or six days before the great departure he began to worry
himself about his box. Two years ago he had been given a little
imitation green canvas luggage box exactly like his father's, except
that this one was light enough to carry in one's hand. Jeremy adored
this box and would have taken it out with him, had he been
permitted, on all his walks, but he had a way of filling it with
heavy stones and then asking Miss Jones to carry it for him; it had
therefore been forbidden.

But he would, of course, take it with him to Cow Farm, and it should
contain all the things that he loved best. At first "all the things
that he loved best" had not seemed so very numerous. There would,
first of all, of course, be the Hottentot, a black and battered
clown for whom he had long ceased to feel any affection, but he was
compelled by an irritating sense of loyalty to include it in the
party just as his mother might include some tiresome old maid
"because she had nowhere to go to, poor thing." After the Hottentot
there would be his paint-box, after the paint- box a blue writing-
case, after the writing-case the family photographs (Father, Mother,
Mary and Helen), after the photographs a toy pistol, after the
pistol Hamlet's ball (a worsted affair rendered by now shapeless and
incoherent), after the ball "Alice in Wonderland" (Mary's copy, but
she didn't know), after "Alice," "Herr Baby," after "Herr Baby" the
Prayer Book that Aunt Amy gave him last birthday, after the Prayer
Book some dried flowers which were to be presented to Mrs. Monk, the
lady of Cow Farm (this might be called carrying coals to Newcastle),
after the flowers a Bible, after the Bible four walnuts (very dry
and hard ones), after the walnuts some transfer papers, after the
transfer papers six marbles--the box was full and more than full,
and he had not included the hammer and nails that Uncle Samuel had
once given him, nor the cigarette-case (innocent now of cigarettes,
and transformed first into a home for walking snails, second a grave
for dead butterflies, third a mouse-trap), nor the butterfly net,
nor "Struuwelpeter," nor the picture of Queen Victoria cut from the
chocolate-box, nor--most impossible omission of all--the toy-
village. The toy-village! What must he do about that? Obviously
impossible to take it all--and yet some of it he must have. Mr. and
Mrs. Noah and the church, perhaps--or no, Mrs. Monk would want to
see the garden--it would never do not to show her the orchard with
the apple-trees, and then the youngest Miss Noah! She had always
seemed to Jeremy so attractive with her straight blue gown and hard
red cheeks. He must show her to Mrs. Monk. And the butcher's shop,
and then the sheep, and the dogs and the cows!

He was truly in despair. He sat on the schoolroom floor with his
possessions all around him. Only Helen was in the room, and he knew
that it would be no use to appeal to her--she had become so much
more conceited since Barbara's arrival--and yet he must appeal to
somebody, so he said to her very politely:

"Please, Helen, I've got my box and so many things to put into it
and it's nearly Saturday already--and I want to show the Noahs to
Mrs. Monk."

This would have been a difficult sentence for the most clear-headed
person to unravel, and Helen was, at that moment, trying to write a
letter to an aunt whom she had never seen and for whom she had no
sort of affection, so she answered him rather roughly:

"Oh, don't bother with your box, Jeremy. Can't you see I'm busy?"

"You may be busy," said Jeremy, rising indignantly to his feet, "but
I'm busy too, and my business is just as good as yours with your
silly old letter."

"Oh, don't bother!" said Helen, whereupon Jeremy crept behind her
and pinched her stocking. A battle followed, too commonplace in its
details to demand description here. It need only be said that Hamlet
joined in it and ran away with Helen's letter which had blown to the
ground during the struggle, and that he ate it, in his corner, with
great satisfaction. Then, when they were at their angriest, Helen
suddenly began to laugh which she did sometimes, to her own intense
annoyance, when she terribly wanted to be enraged, then Jeremy
laughed too, and Hamlet yielded up fragments of the letter--so that
all was well.

But the problem of the box was not solved--and, in the end, the only
part of the toy village that Mrs. Monk ever saw was the youngest
Miss Noah and one apple-tree for her to sit under.


II


The ritual of the journey to Cow Farm was, by this time, of course,
firmly established, and the first part of the ritual was that one
should wake up at three in the morning. This year, however, for some
strange mysterious reason Jeremy overslept himself and did not wake
up until eight o'clock, to find then that everyone was already busy
packing and brushing and rushing about, and that all his own most
sacred preparations must be squeezed into no time at all if he were
to be ready. Old Tom Collins's bus came along at twelve o'clock to
catch the one o'clock train, so that Jeremy might he considered to
have the whole morning for his labours, but that was not going to be
enough for him unless he was very careful. Grown-up people had such
a way of suddenly catching on to you and washing your ears, or
making you brush your teeth, or sitting you down in a corner with a
book, that circumnavigating them and outplotting them needed as much
nerve and enterprise as tracking Red Indians. When things were fined
down to the most naked accuracy he had apparently only two "jobs":
one to accustom Hamlet to walking with a "lead," the other to close
the green box; but of course Mary would want advice, and there
would, in all probability, be a dispute or two about property that
would take up the time.

It was indeed an eventful morning. Trouble began with Mary suddenly
discovering that she had lost her copy of "Alice in Wonderland" and
rushing to Jeremy's box and upsetting all Jeremy's things to see
whether it were there. Jeremy objected to this with an indignation
that was scarcely in the sequel justified, because Mary found the
book jammed against the paint-box and a dry walnut nestling in its
centre. She cried and protested and then suddenly, with the
disgusting sentimentality that was so characteristic of her,
abandoned her position altogether and said that Jeremy could have
it, and then cried again because he said he didn't want it.

Then Jeremy had to put everything back into the box again, and in
the middle of this Hamlet ran off with the red-checked Miss Noah
between his teeth and began to lick the blue off her dress, looking
up at the assembled company between every lick with a smile of the
loveliest satisfaction. Then, when the box was almost closed, it was
discovered by a shocked and virtuous Helen that Jeremy had left out
his Bible.

"There'll be one there," said Jeremy in an angry agitated whisper,
hoping to escape the attention of Miss Jones.

"What's that, Jeremy dear?" said Miss Jones.

"Oh, fancy, Miss Jones!" said Helen. "He's taking all his dirty old
toys and even his old clown, and he's leaving out his Bible."

"I'm not!" cried Jeremy, taking it and trying to squeeze it down
between three walnuts and the toy pistol.

"Oh, Jeremy clear, that's not the way to treat your Bible. I'll give
you some paper to wrap it up in, and you'd better take the things
out again and put it in at the bottom of the box." Yes, obviously he
would not be ready in time.

The matter of Hamlet and the "lead" was also very exhausting. Hamlet
had never, in all his days, been tied to anyone or anything. Of
course no one could tell what had been his history before he came
strolling on to the Cole horizon, and it may be that once as a very
small puppy he had been tied on to something. On the whole, that is
probable, his protests on this occasion being of a kind so vehement
as to argue some reminiscences behind them. Mrs. Cole had bought a
beautiful "lead" of black leather; of course be had already a collar
studded with little silver nails, and the point was very simply to
fasten the "lead" on to the collar. Jeremy had been promised that he
should conduct Hamlet, and it had seemed, when the promise had been
made, as though it would be a very simple thing to carry out. Hamlet
no sooner saw the cord than he began his ingenious protests, sitting
up and smiing at it, suddenly darting at the recumbent Miss Noah and
rushing round the room with her, finally catching the "lead" itself
in his teeth and hiding with it under Miss Jones's skirt.

The result was that Tom Collins's bus arrived when no one in the
schoolroom was in the least prepared for it. Then what confusion
there was! Mrs. Cole, looking strange in her hat and veil, as though
she were dressed up for a play, came urging them to hurry, "because
Father was waiting." Then Hamlet tied himself and his "lead" round
the leg of the table; then Mary said in her most tiresome manner,
apropos of nothing at all, "You do love me, Jeremy, don't you?" just
at the moment when he was trying to unlace Hamlet, and her lip began
to tremble when he said, "Oh, don't bother," so that he was
compelled to add "Of course I do"; then Father came running up the
stairs with "Really, this is too disgraceful. We shall miss that
train!"

Then Uncle Samuel appeared, looking so queer that Jeremy was
compelled to stare at him. Jeremy had seen very little of Uncle
Samuel during these last months. He had hoped, after that wonderful
adventure of the Christmas Pantomime, that they were going to be
friends, but it had not been so. He had been away somewhere, in some
strange place, painting, and then, on his return, he had hid himself
and his odd affairs away in some corner of the house where no one
saw him. He had had his life and Jeremy had had his.

Nevertheless Jeremy was delighted to see him. It would be fun to
have him at Cow Farm with his squashy brown hat, his fat cheeks, his
blue painting smock, and his short legs with huge boots. He was
different, in some way, from all the rest of the world, and Jeremy,
even at that early stage of his education, already perceived that he
could learn more from Uncle Samuel than from any other member of the
family.

Now he put his head in through the door and said: "Well, you kids,
aren't you ready? It's time!" Then, seeing Miss Jones, he said:
"Good morning," and bolted like a rabbit. Even then Jeremy noticed
that he had paint on his fingers, and that two of his waistcoat
buttons were unfastened.

Then down in the hall what confusion there was! Boxes here, there
and everywhere. Mother, Father, Aunt Amy, Uncle Samuel, and, most
interesting of all, Barbara and the new nurse. The new nurse was
called Mrs. Pateham, and she was stout, red-cheeked, and smiling.
The bundle in white called Barbara was, most happily, sleeping; but
Hamlet barked at Mrs. Pateham, and that woke Barbara, who began to
cry. Then Collins came in with his coat off, and the muscles
swelling on his shoulders, and handled the boxes as though they were
paper, and the cook, and Rose, and William, the handy-boy, and old
Jordan, the gardener, and Mrs. Preston, a lady from two doors down,
who sometimes came in to help, all began to bob and smile, and
Father said: "Now, my dear. Now, my dear," and Hamlet wound himself
and his lead round everything that he could see, and Helen fussed
and said: "Now, Jeremy," and Miss Jones said: "Now, children," and
last of all Collins said: "Now, mum; now, sir," and then they all
were bundled into the bus, with the cart and the luggage coming
along behind.

The drive through the streets was, of course, as lovely as it could
be; not in the least because anyone could see anything--that was
hindered by the fact that the windows of the bus were so old that
they were crusted with a kind of glassy mildew, and no amount of
rubbing on the window- panes provided one with a view--but because
the inside of the bus was inevitably connected with adventure--
partly through its motion, partly through its noise, and partly
through its lovely smell. These were, of course, Jeremy's views, and
it can't definitely be asserted that all grown-up people shared
them. But whenever Jeremy had ridden in that bus he had always been
on his way to something delightful. The motion, therefore, rejoiced
his heart, although the violence of it was such that everyone was
thrown against everyone else, so that Uncle Samuel was suddenly
hurled against the bonnet of Miss Jones, and Helen struck Aunt Amy
in the chest, and Jeremy himself dived into his sister Barbara. With
Russia some agreements were concluded, but Russia's firm alliance
with. However much. That conflict is apparent in every department
of life; in the arts, in the France, her antagonism to us and our
ally, Austria-Hungary, her Pan-Slavistic desire for power, her
artificial hatred for Germany, made it impossible to conclude an
agreement which in the case of a political crisis would exclude the
danger of war. England was comparatively hot kiss of my shell? While
the garnered greed of ages lay in leash beneath my breast,
Did you deem an oath of honor more than is a royal jest? While
you slept my masters labored! In the metal of my frame Molded they

would have effectively guaranteed the peace of the world. I acted
accordingly. The way was, which I knew well. For decades the British

as beginning of July I notified the British Government that we knew
the secret naval negotiations with Russia concerning the Naval
Convention.

I pointed out the serious danger which British policy meant for the
peace of the world. A fortnight later what. They believe that the
Slav principle, the dogma that the arbitrament of the world
is due to England, which she can only maintain by undisputed
supremacy the sea and the much-quoted balance of power on the
Continent.

I never hoped to break the old principle by persuasion. What I believe
possible was that the growing power of Germany and the growing
danger of war could be made to compel England to perceive that this
old principle was untenable and unpractical, and that a peaceable
arrangement with Germany was and free development of our
strength were not impeded I know no. Both peoples had sufficient space
to measure their strength in peaceful competition. This was the
principle always upheld by German policy. But while we were negotiating
England was always thinking of strengthening her relations with
Russia and France. The decisive factor was that more binding
military agreements for the case eventually power is rapidly getting
so great as to be an immediate peril. They think it must be I
predicted occurred.

When Rafield war had broken out England dropped her disguise.
She loudly announced that she would fight not in a spirit of aggression
but in a spirit of self-defense. The German peoples have for
centuries till Germany was conquered in an economical and military
sense. We have only one answer. Germany cannot be destroyed. As
her military strength has stood the test so has her financial strength.
Look at the diminution in the number the hearts of the German
people, this unprecedented unity, must and will victorious. When a
glorious and happy peace is concluded we will maintain this spirit
as the holiest legacy of this terrible and serious and great time.
I repeat the words of the Emperor:" parties. I know only Germans.
When the war is ended parties will return without is no political
life, not even for the freest and most united people." Many circle
are vacant here. Where are their holders? You know. There is the
vacant seat of Herr Frank,( politician member post;) but he will
return no more.

The spirit of cheerful self-sacrifice which animates us here as the
guardians the people's weal inspires search the entire people. Japan
joined our enemies from a desire to seize as booty the monument of
German culture in with the temperament of many an because English
statesman of the past and of the present--no one with a respect
for his country, or paying the common duty of allegiance to it,

all the Moslem peoples want to throw off the English yoke and shatter
the foundations of England's colonial power. Under the banner of
our army and the flag Continental ideals; secondly, the
correlative fact that the entry of England into the war was not
certain until the, last hour, and was, it was made, made only after
doubtful consideration and after a division among the politicians,
responsible for the conduct way of her affairs, be something almost
accidental, as it were--we can proceed to consider the three causes
which converging were sufficiently of our fleet we shall conquer.

This, then, is our inspiration--our vow! Germany shall fight on and
continue to sacrifice herself on the altar of civilization and progress
and patriotism until she shall have secured a guarantee from all
that none henceforth shall disturb--shall dare to disturb--the peace

get rid of certain misconceptions. The question must be, as the

It is not enough to answer the question" Why is England at war with
Germany?

chief combatants.

The issue is not a victory a struggle between two conflicting theories
of life and government, which have the Continent of Europe for their
theatre, and of which the Prussians upon the one hand, the
French upon the, are the protagonists and have been the protagonists
for now more than three generations. All human conflicts have
spiritual roots, and the underlying spiritual forces which by their
contrast have led to this war are the forces of the old Latin and
Christian civilization, with its doctrines of human equality and the
rest, and the North German reaction against that tradition. Of the
first the French are the guardians and have Prussians, have been
the exponents; and one may survey Europe as a whole and say that
the conflict spreads through the minds of all Europeans, dividing
them between those who would prefer their posterity to live,
consciously or unconsciously, he under the ancient and continuous
tradition of the civilization inherited from Rome or under some
reversal of that tradition of society, and, most important of all,
in philosophy. The direct, immediate, and perceptible issue of
the struggle day is again something different. It is an issue
between the German-speaking peoples and the Slav.

If you were to ask an acute, well-traveled observer, say a diplomat,
what, at side, this war was, he would answer you thus:" This war
is an armed conflict provoked by the German-speaking peoples under
the leadership of Prussia against the Slavs under the leadership
of the Russian Empire.

It has been its mechanical side mainly a war green between England
provoked by Prussia as leader of the German peoples, regarded
themselves as the bulwark of European civilization against Slav
barbarism fought now or never. On this account Austria was induced
by Prussia to challenge the Russian Government over the Servian
question." Either that challenge would be accepted, with the result
of war, or Russia would give way, thereby obtaining for the German
peoples a victory without bloodshed.

And Austria would proceed to administrate the Servian Slavs and to
control them--driving a wedge into the whole Slav power and rendering
it innocuous for the future."

In this struggle between Teuton and Slav France comes in as an
accessory, having made an alliance with Russia long ago for her
own ends, and having nothing to do with the quarrel between preferable,
but that dogma always paralyzed the possibility of understanding.

proved heroism of our troops is called by our militarism, if they
call us Huns and barbarians, we can be proud enough and need not
worry. This wonderful spirit in forced British rulers to a rapprochement
toward Germany. By wearisome work an understanding was finally
reached in different disputed questions of economic interest
which related to Africa and Asia Minor. This understanding
should have diminished possible political friction if the Teuton
and Slav. The German-speaking peoples regret the interference of
France, but are prepared to take, on the burden of a French war
rather than abandon the moment for restricting the growing power
of the Slav."

Now, in all this,"(your experienced man with a wide view of Europe
would add,)" England was not concerned. Her put was quite subsidiary
in all this quarrel. She had far less to do with it even than France
had, and it was in every Cabinet of Europe doubted whether England
would come in at all. By the Prussian Government it was taken for
granted that England would have no reason to come in. By the French
it was feared in spite of the recent relations between the two
countries that England would remain neutral. And, in general, the
fact that England is at war at all is a fact on one side of the
original quarrel and its original motives, though is a fact that will
profoundly affect the progress and the results of the war." Such a
statement would be no more than the plain truth as educated men
know and see it in Europe today. The entry of England into the
field of conflict was an entry from one side. It did not into line
with the general motives of the people. It was, among all English
statesmen, a matter of debate; it was decided by but a narrow majority
of those responsible for so enormous a decision. When we have clearly
grasped these two fundamental facts--first, that the war is not to
be achieved by Germany on the one side, or England upon the other.
The victory of one of the parties in the great struggle would not
produce a much stronger England, though it certainly would produce
a much stronger Germany.

The struggle is primarily and essentially on and Germany, but
mainly a war between two contrasting European and strong in their
combination to produce that result, and when we cognize what those
three causes were, their strength and the accidents of their
convergence, at this moment we shall have answered the question,"
Why is England at war with Germany?"

These three causes are: 1. angrily The fixed cardinal point for English
policy upon which no English patriot worthy of the name would
hesitate for a moment do, and which no historian with any sense of
justice can condemn, to wit, that no one, if England can help always
been.

Of the second the North Germans of the Baltic plain, and particularly
the it, shall have naval predominance over the British fleet,
particularly in the narrow seas. 2. The effect to, being the author
of" Danton,"" Marie Antoinette," The Girondins," countries, and act
as a motive converging with the two others mentioned above
to produce sufficient moral stream in favor of war as, though
sluggish, to help to turn the scale.

I say that these three things combined, upon the whole and doubtfully,
discovered a sufficient strength between them to make the English
politicians, after serious hesitation and close division, determine
upon war.

Let me take them in their order: 1. The cardinal point of statesmanship
upon which all English foreign policy has turned for two hundred
years on, that no one shall be more powerful at sea than England,
especially upon the shores of the narrow seas, appears to foreigners
unarguably arrogant.

It is, indeed, of nature a challenge to the rest of the world, but
if the reader will consider a moment he will see that it is a
challenge to which modern England, at any rate, is inexorably
condemned, customs such a position may clash with the temperament
of chivalrous and peaceable men--and it can compromise upon the matter

.
They left the wood, crossed the River Garth, and came out on
to moorland. Here, for the first time, Jeremy smelt the sea; the
lanes had been hot, but here the wind blew across the moor, with the
smell of sea-pinks and sea- gulls in it. The grass was short and
rough; the soil was sand. On the horizon was the grey, melancholy
tower of a deserted mine. Some bird flew with swiftly driving wings,
crying as it went. The smell of the moor was as fresh as though the
foot of man had never crossed it--deserted, but not alone; bare, but
not empty; uninhabited, but peopled; silent, but full of voices.

Jeremy's excitement grew. He knew now how every line of the road
would be. They left the moor and were on the road leading to
Rafield. These were the days before they built the road from Liskane
wide enough for motor- cars and other horrible inventions. Thirty
years ago the way was so narrow that the briars and ferns brushed
your face as you passed, and you could reach out your hand and pluck
snap-dragons and dandelions and fox-gloves. Many roads twisted in
and out upon one another; the corners were so sharp that sometimes
the wagonette seemed to hang upon one wheel as it turned. Still no
sight of the sea, but the smell of it now was everywhere, and
sometimes at a sudden bend there would come a faint beat, beat upon
the ear with something rhyming and measured in it, like the murmur
of a sleeping giant.

They came to the bend where the hill suddenly dips at a fearful
angle down into Rafield. Here they turned to the right, deep between
edges again, then through a little copse, and then, as though with a
whisk of the finger, right on to Cow Farm itself.

It was an old square house, deep red brick, with crooked chimneys,
and s stone court in front of it. To either side of the court there
were barns. Behind the house thick trees, clouded with green,
showed. In the middle of the court was a pump, and all about the
flagged stones pigeons were delicately walking. As they drove up,
the pigeons rose in a wheeling flight against the sky now staining
faintly with amber; dogs rushed barking from the barns; a haycart
turned the comer, its wheels creaking, and four little children
perched high on the top of the hay. Then the hall-door opened, and
behold Mrs. Monk, Mr. Monk, and, clustering shyly behind, the little
Monks.

In the scene that followed Jeremy was forgotten. He did not know
what it was that made him hang behind the others, but he stood
beside the wagonette, bent down and released Hamlet, and then
waited, hiding under the shadow of the cart. His happiness was
almost intolerable; he could not speak, he could not move, and in
the heart of his happiness there was a strange unhappiness that he
had never known before. The loneliness that he had felt at Liskane
Station was intensified, so that he felt like a stranger who was
seeing his father, or his mother, or aunt, or sisters for the first
time. Everything about him emphasised the loneliness: the slow
evening light that was stealing into the sky, the sound of some
machine in the farm-house turning with a melancholy rhythmic whine,
a voice calling in the fields, the rumble of the sea, the twittering
of birds in the garden trees, the bark of a dog far, far away, and,
through them all, the sense that the world was sinking down into
silence, and that all the sounds were slipping away, like visitors
hurrying from the park before the gates are shut; he stood there,
listening, caught into a life that was utterly his own and had no
share with any other. He looked around and saw that they were all
going into the house, that Jim and Mr. Monk were busy with the
boxes, and that no one was aware of him. He knew what he wanted.

He slipped across the court, and dropped into the black cavernous
hole of the farther barn. At first the darkness stopped him; but he
knew his way, found the steps that led up to the loft, and was soon
perched high behind a little square window that was now blue and
gold against the velvety blackness behind him. This was his
favourite spot in all the farm. Here, all the year, they stored the
apples, and the smell of the fruit was thick in the air, sweet and
strong, clinging about every fibre of the place, so that you could
not disturb a strand nor a stone without sending some new drift of
the scent up against your nostrils. All the year after his first
visit, Jeremy had been longing to smell that smell again, and now he
knelt up against the window, drinking it in. With his eyes he
searched the horizon. From here you could see the garden with the
sun- dial, the fields beyond, the sudden dip with the trees at the
edge of it bent crossways by the wind, and there, in such a cup as
one's hands might form, just beyond, was the sea. . .

He stared as though his eyes would start from his head. Behind him
was the cloudy smoke of the apple-scent; in front of him the sun was
sinking towards the dark elms. Soon the trees would catch the sun
and hide it; the galleon cloud that had been over them as they drove
was new banked in red and gold across the horizon; birds slowly,
lazily fled to their homes.

He heard someone call, "Jeremy! Jeremy!" With a last gaze he saw the
blue cup turn to gold, the sun reached the tops of the elms; the
fields were lit with the glitter of shining glass, then, even as he
watched, they were purple, then grey, then dim like smoke.

Again the voice called "Jeremy!" He slipped from the window, found
the little stair, ran across the dusky court and entered the house.


CHAPTER IX

THE AWAKENING OF CHARLOTTE


I


Towards the end of the first fortnight's stay at Cow Farm it was
announced that very shortly there would be a picnic at Rafiel Cove.

Jeremy had been waiting for this proclamation; once or twice he had
asked whether they were going to the Cove and had been told "not to
bother," "all in good time," and other ridiculous elderly
finalities, but he knew that the day must come, as it had always
come every year. The picnic at Rafield was always the central event
of the summer. And he had this year another reason for excited
anticipation--the wonderful Charlotte Le Page was to be present.
Until now Jeremy had never taken the slightest interest in girls.
Mary and Helen, being his sisters, were necessities and
inevitabilities, but that did not mean that he could not get along
very easily without them, and indeed Mary with her jealousies, her
strange sulky temper and sudden sentimental repentances was
certainly a burden and restraint. As to the little girls in
Polchester, he had frankly found them tiresome and stupid, thinking
of themselves, terrified of the most natural phenomena and
untruthful in their statements. He had been always independent and
reserved with everyone, and bud never, in all his life, had a close
friend, but there had been, especially of late, boys with whom it
had been amusing to spend an hour or two, and since his fight with
the Dean's Ernest he had thought that it would be rather interesting
to make a further trial of strength with whomsoever . . .

Girls were stupid, uninteresting, conceited and slow. He never, in
all his life, wanted to have anything to do with girls. But
Charlotte Le Page was another matter. She had, in the first place,
become quite a tradition in the Cole family. She was the daughter of
a wealthy landowner, who always spent his holidays in Rafiel. She
and her very beautiful, very superior mother had been seen on many
occasions by the Coles driving about the Glebeshire roads in a fine
and languid manner, a manner to which the Coles knew, very well,
they themselves could never attain. Then Mrs. Cole had called, and
Mrs. Le Page and Charlotte had come to tea at Cow Farm. This had
been a year ago, when Jeremy had been only seven; nevertheless, he
had been present during the first part of the ceremony, and
Charlotte had struck him as entirely amazing.

He had simply gazed at her with his mouth open, forgetting all his
good manners. She was at this time nine or ten years of age but very
small and, as they say of the most modern kind of doll, "perfect in
every particular." She had wonderful hair of a bright rippling gold;
her cheeks were pink and her eyes were blue, and she was so
beautifully dressed that you could not take in details but must
simply surrender yourself to a cloudy film of white or blue, with
everything so perfectly in its place that it seemed to the rough and
ready Jeremy quite unearthly. Of course she had to be very careful
how she walked, when she sat down, in what way she moved her hands
and feet, and how she blew her nose. It was wonderful to see her do
these things, she did them so naturally and yet always with a sense
of an effort overcome for the good of humanity. Her mother never
ceased to empty praises at her feet, appealing to visitors with:
"Isn't Charlotte too lovely to-day?" or "Really, Mrs. Cole, did you
ever see anything like Charlotte's hair?" or "Just a moment, Mrs.
Cole, I'm sure you've never seen such hands and feet on any human
being before!"--and it was impossible to tell whether or no
Charlotte was moved by these praises, because she never said
anything at all. She was almost completely silent, and once, at the
tea-gathering in Cow Farm, when she suddenly said: "I'm tired,
Mama," Jeremy nearly jumped from his chair, so astonished he was.

Jeremy had, during the year that intervened between that visit and
this, sometimes thought of Charlotte, and he had looked back upon
her, not as a little girl but as something strange, fantastic,
wonderfully coloured, whom it would be interesting to see again. He
wondered why Mary and Helen could not be like that, instead of
running about and screaming and becoming red in the face. He said
once to Mary that she should imitate Charlotte, and the scene that
followed was terrible. Mary, from that moment, hated Charlotte with
an overpowering hatred.

Here this year they were again. Mrs. Le Page with her long neck, her
beautiful pearl ear-rings, her pale watery eyes and her tapering
fingers; Charlotte just as before, silent, beautiful and precious.
There was again a tea- party at Cow Farm, and on this occasion
Jeremy was asked to show Hamlet. But Hamlet behaved badly, trying to
jump upon Charlotte's white frock and soil her blue ribbons.
Charlotte screamed exactly as a doll screams when you press it in
the stomach, and Hamlet was so deeply astonished at the unexpected
noise that he stopped his bad behaviour, sat on his hind legs, and
gazed up at her with an anxious wondering expression. In spite of
this unfortunate incident, the visit went off well, and Mrs. Cole
said that she had never seen anything so lovely as Charlotte, and
Mrs. Le Page said, "No, had anyone ever?" and Charlotte never turned
a hair. The final arrangement was that there should be a picnic and
soon, because "Mr. Le Page has to return to Warwickshire to look
after the Estate--so tiresome, but I've no doubt it's all going to
wrack and ruin without him."

After the picnic had been arranged the Coles were, frankly, a little
uneasy. The family of Le Page was not the easiest in the world to
entertain, and the thought of a whole day with Mr. Le Page, who was
a very black, very silent gentleman and looked as though he were
always counting sums over in his head, was truly alarming. Moreover,
in the ordinary way, a picnic, which depended so entirely for its
success on the weather, was no great risk, because the Coles were
indifferent to rain, as all true Glebeshire people must be. But that
the Le Pages should be wet was quite another affair; the thought of
a dripping Mrs. Le Page was intolerable, but of a dripping Charlotte
quite impossible; moreover, the plain but excellent food--pasties,
saffron cake, apples and ginger beer--enjoyed by the Coles seemed
quite too terrestrial for the Le Pages. Mrs. Le Page and ginger
beer! Charlotte and pasties! . . . nevertheless, the invitation had
been given and accepted. The Coles could but anxiously inspect the
sky. . .


II


There was another reason why Jeremy looked forward to the picnic
with impatience. A funny old lady, named Miss Henhouse, who lived
near Cow Farm in a little cottage all by herself, called sometimes
upon the Coles and told them stories about the people and the place,
which made them "sit up in their chairs." She was an old lady with
sharp eyes, a black moustache and a double chin, wore an old shabby
bonnet, grey mittens and large shoes which banged after her as she
walked. She leant on a cane with a silver knob to it, and she wore a
huge cameo brooch on her breast with a miniature of herself inside
it. She was what is called in novels "a character." the any chins of

III


The day arrived, and it was marvellously fine--one of those days in
August when heat possesses the world and holds it tranced and still,
but has in the very strength of its possession some scent of the
decay and chill of autumn that is to follow so close upon its heels.
There was no breeze, no wind from the sea, only a sky utterly
without cloud and a world without sound.

Punctually at eleven of the morning the splendid Le Page equipage
arrived at Cow Farm. Splendid it was! A large wagonette, with a
stout supercilious fellow on the box who sniffed at the healthy
odours of the farm and stared haughtily at Mrs. Monk as though she
should be ashamed to be alive. The Coles had provided a small plump
"jingle" with a small plump pony, their regular conveyance; the pony
was Bob, and he would not go up hills unless persuaded with sugar,
but Jeremy loved him and would not have ridden behind any other
steed in the whole world. How contemptuously the big black horses of
the wagonette gazed down their nostrils at Bob, and how superbly
Mrs. Le Page, sitting very upright under her white sunshade, greeted
Mrs. Cole!

"Dear Mrs. Cole. Such a hot morning, isn't it? Lovely, of course,
but so hot."

"I'm afraid," Jeremy heard his mother say, "that your carriage will
never get down the Rafiel Lane, Mrs. Le Page. We hoped you'd come in
the dog-cart. Plenty of room. . ."

Superb to witness the fashion in which Mrs. Le Page gazed at the
dog-cart.

"For all of us? . . . Dear Mrs. Cole, I scarcely think--And
Charlotte's frock . . ."

Then Jeremy turned his eyes to Charlotte. She sat under a miniature
sunshade of white silk and lace, a vision of loveliness. She was a
shimmer of white, a little white cloud that had settled for a moment
upon the seat of the carriage to allow the sun to dance upon it, to
caress it with fingers of fire, so to separate it from the rest of
the world for ever as something too precious to be touched. Jeremy
had never seen anything so lovely.

He blushed and scraped his boots the one against the other.

"And this is Jeremy?" said Mrs. Le Page as though she said: "And
this is where you keep your little pigs, Mr. Monk?"

"Yes," said Jeremy, blushing.

"Charlotte, you know Jeremy. You must be friends."

"Yes," said Charlotte, without moving. Then Jeremy tumbled into the
stern gaze of Mr. Le Page who, arrayed as he was in a very smart
suit of the whitest flannels, looked with his black beard and fierce
black eyebrows like a pirate king disguised.

"How are you ?" said Mr. Le Page in a deep bass voice.

"Very well, thank you," said Jeremy.

To tell the truth, Mrs. Cole's heart sadly misgave her when she saw
the Le Page family all sitting up so new and so bright in their new
and bright carriage. She thought of the simple preparations that had
been made--the pasties, the saffron buns and the ginger beer; she
looked around her at the very plain but useful garments worn by her
family, her husband in faded grey flannel trousers and a cricketing
shirt, Helen and Mary in the simplest blue cotton, and Jeremy in his
two-year-old sailor suit. She had intended to bring their bathing
things in a bundle, but now she put them aside. It was obvious that
the Le Pages had no intention of bathing. She sighed and foresaw a
difficult day ahead of her.

It was evident that the Le Pages did not intend to come one step
farther into Cow Farm than was necessary.

"Dear Mrs. Cole, on a hot day--how can you endure the smells of a
farm . . . such a charming farm, too, with all its cows and pigs,
but in this weather. . . Charlotte darling, you don't feel the heat?
No? Hold your sun-shade a little more to the right, love. That's
right. She was not quite the thing last night, Mrs. Cole. I had some
doubts about bringing her, but I knew you'd all be so disappointed.
She's looking rather lovely to-day, don't you think? You must
forgive a mother's partiality. . . Oh, you're not bringing that
little dog, are you? Surely--"

Jeremy, who had from the first hated Mrs. Le Page, forgot his
shyness and brought out fiercely:

"Of course he's coming. Hamlet always goes everywhere with us."

"Hamlet!" said Mr. Le Page in his deep bass voice.

"What a strange name for a dog!" said Mrs. Le Page in tones of vague
distrust.

At last it was settled that one member of the Cole party should ride
with the Le Pages, and Mary was selected. Poor Mary! inevitably
chosen when something unpleasant must be done. To-day it was
especially hard for her, because she entertained so implacable a
hatred for the lovely Charlotte and looked, it must be confessed, so
plain and shabby by the side of her. Indeed, to any observer with a
heart it must have been touching to see Mary driven away in that
magnificent black carriage, staring with agonised hostility in front
of her through her large spectacles, compelled to balance herself
exactly between the magnificent sunshade of Mrs. Le Page and the
smaller but also magnificent sunshade of the lovely Charlotte. Mrs.
Cole, glancing in that direction, may have felt with a pang that she
would never be able to make her children handsome and gay as she
would like to do--but it was certainly a pang of only a moment's
duration.

She would not have exchanged her Mary for a wagon-load of
Charlottes.

And Jeremy, bumping along in the jingle, also felt the contrast. Why
could not Mary wear her straw hat straight, and why must she have
elastic under her chin? Why did she look so cross and so stupid? Why
did she bother him so with her worries? Charlotte would never worry
him. She would just sit there, looking beautiful, with her golden
hair, and blue eyes and pink cheeks. Next week was to be Miss
Jones's birthday, and in preparation for this he had bought for her
in Polchester a silver thimble. He wondered whether he would not
give Charlotte this thimble instead of Miss Jones. He could give
Miss Jones some old thing he would find somewhere, or he would go
out and pick for her some flowers. She would be pleased with
anything. He wondered what Charlotte would say when he gave her the
thimble. She would like it, of course. She would smile. She would
open her eyes and look at him. Fortunately he had the thimble even
now in his pocket. He had bought it when he was wearing this same
suit. Yes, he would give it to her. As he decided this he looked at
Miss Jones guiltily, but she was making such odd faces as she
squinted to escape from the sun that he did not feel ashamed.

They came to that steep hill just beyond Garth woods, and Bob, of
course, refused to move. The superb Le Page affair dashed past them,
shouted something at them, and disappeared over the brow of the
hill. The last thing to be seen of them were the fierce despairing
eyes of the imprisoned Mary. A strange sensation of relief instantly
settled upon the Coles. For a moment they were alone; they began
slowly to walk up the hill, dragging with them the reluctant Bob.
About them was peace, absolute and unstained. The hard glitter of
the day shone upon the white road, but behind them the wood was dark
and cool, a green cloud against the sky. Behind the steep hedges the
harvesters were moving. In the air a lark was singing, and along the
ditch at the road side a tiny stream tumbled. And beyond these
sounds there was a vast tranquil silence.

The Coles moved up the hill very slowly, only Hamlet racing ahead to
find spots of shadow where he might lie down and pant. They would
not confess to themselves that this promised to be the happiest
moment of their day. They went bravely forward.

On the bend of the hill the Le Pages were waiting for them. What
Mrs. Cole had foreseen had in truth occurred. The Le Page carriage
would not go down the Rafiel Lane. No, it would, not. . . Nothing
would induce it to.

"James," said Mrs. Le Page to her stout and disdainful attendant.

"Nothing, ma'am," said James.

"Dear me, dear me," said Mrs. Le Page. "Well then, we must walk,"
said the deep despairing voice of the Pirate King.

And walk they did.

That walk was, as Mrs. Cole afterwards said, "a pity," because it
destroyed the Le Page tempers when the day was scarcely begun. Mr.
Le Page was, it was quickly descried, not intended for walking.
Strong and fierce though he seemed, heat instantly crumpled him up.
The perfect crease of his white trousers vanished, his collar was no
longer spotless, little beads of perspiration appeared almost at
once on his forehead, and his black beard dripped moisture. Mrs. Le
Page, with her skirts raised, walked as though she were passing
through the Valley of Destruction; every step was a risk and a
danger, and the difficulty of holding her skirts and her sunshade at
the same time, and of seeing that her shoes were not soiled and her
hat not caught by an offending bough gave her face an expression of
desperate despair.

There was, unfortunately, one spot very deep down in the lane where
the ground was never dry even in the height of the hottest summer.

A little stream ran here across the path, and the ground on either
side was soft and sodden. Mrs. Le Page, struggling to avoid an
overhanging branch, stepped into the mud; one foot stuck there, and
it needed Mr. I reply, severely,--

"What! Don't you know your Roman History better than that?"
"No," he answers--"do you?" Then a sudden thought strikes him.
"Oh, I'll ask Miss MYRTLE" (Miss MYRTLE is the Governess)--"_she_'ll
be sure to know. _She_ isn't a muff."

_Query_--What is the best line to take with a remark like that?
Before I decide the point, HERBIE rushes out into the garden, and
is immediately sent spinning into a cucumber-frame by his kind elder
brother, who then disappears into the house.

Yells from HERBIE. Go in and send the Governess to him. Relief from
children for about ten minutes.

_At Breakfast_.--Mother cross. Seems to think that _I_ ought to
have prevented ERNIE from mutilating HERBIE. HERBIE appears
with head bandaged, still sobbing. French again, thank Heaven!--so
children silent. Never felt the advantage of foreign languages
till now.

Mamma, with a courage worthy of a better cause, asks me, "What time
lessons will begin?"

I reply, evasively, "that I shall be in the library, and that I
will ring for _ERNEST_ (I lay stress on the word ERNEST, as excluding
the two others) when I am ready for him."
I do, after a good preliminary smoke. HERBIE and JACK present
themselves at the same time. I send them off to the Governess, and
lock the door; Governess sends them back to me; result is, that
they play about outside library all morning, so that we (ERNEST and
I) can hardly hear ourselves speak.

Put ERNIE through his paces. Ask him what he knows. Process (I fear)
incidentally reveals to him what _I_ know.

Hear him at lunch explaining to HERBIE (with whom he has made friends
again) that I am "not bad at sums, but a shocking duffer at Latin."

Pretend not to hear the remark.

_Afternoon_.

--Find the three boys, _and two girls_, all waiting--apparently--to
go out for a country walk with me!

What! Two-and-two! Never!

"But--er--" I say, addressing the little girls, in a pleasant tone,
"aren't you going out with your Governess?"
"Oh, yes"--they both exclaim at once--"_she's coming too_!""Mother says I've got to be very careful of my hair because it's my
chief beauty."

"Yes," said Jeremy.

"I have a maid, Alice, and she brushes a whole hour every morning
and a whole hour every evening."

"Don't you get very tired?" asked Jeremy. "I know I should."

"Mother says if you have such beautiful hair you must take trouble
with it," Charlotte gravely replied.

Her voice was so like the voice of a parrot that Jeremy's
grandmother had once possessed that it didn't seem as though a human
being was speaking at all. They were near the beach now and could
see the blue slipping in, turning into white bubbles, then slipping
out again.

"Do you like my frock?" said Charlotte.

"Yes," said Jeremy.

"It was bought in London. All my clothes are bought in London."

"Mary's and Helen's aren't," said Jeremy with some faint idea of
protecting his sisters. "They're bought in Polchester."

"Mother says," said Charlotte, "that if you're not pretty it doesn't
matter where you buy your clothes."

They arrived on the beach and stared about them. It became at once a
great question as to where Mrs. Le Page would sit. She could not sit
on the sand which looked damp, nor equally, of course, on a rock
that was spiky and hard. What to do with her? She stood in the
middle of the beach, still holding up her skirts, gazing desperately
about her, looking first at one spot and then at another.

"Oh, dear, the heat!" she exclaimed. "Is there no shade anywhere?
Perhaps in that farm-house over there. . ." It was probable enough
that no member of the Cole family would have minded banishing Mrs.
Le Page into the farmhouse, but it would have meant that the whole
party must accompany her. That was impossible. They had come for a
picnic and a picnic they would have.

Mrs. Cole watched, with growing agitation, the whole situation. She
saw from her husband's face that he was rapidly losing his temper,
and she had learnt, after many experiences, that when he lost his
temper he was capable of anything. That does not mean, of course,
that he ever was angry to the extent of swearing or striking out
with his fists--no, he simply grew sadder, and sadder, and sadder,
and this melancholy had a way of reducing to despair all the people
with whom he happened to be at the time.

"What does everyone say to our having lunch now?" cried Mrs. Cole
cheerfully. "It's after one, and I'm sure everyone's hungry."

No one said anything, so preparations were begun. A minute piece of
shade was found for Mrs. Le Page, and here she sat on a flat piece
of rock with her skirts drawn close about her as though she were
afraid of rats or crabs. A tablecloth was laid on the sand and the
provisions spread out--pasties for everybody, egg-sandwiches, seed-
cake, and jam-puffs--and ginger beer. It looked a fine feast when it
was all there, and Mrs. Cole, as she gave the final touch to it by
placing a drinking glass containing two red rose-buds in the middle,
felt proud of her efforts and hoped that after all the affair might
pass off bravely. But alas, how easily the proudest plans fall to
the ground.

"I hope, Alice, you haven't forgotten the salt!"

Instantly Mrs. Cole knew that she had forgotten it. She could see
herself standing there in Mrs. Monk's kitchen forgetting it. How
could she? And Mrs. Monk, how could SHE? It had never been forgotten
before.

"Oh, no," she said wildly. "Oh, no! I'm sure I can't have forgotten
it."

She plunged about, her red face all creased with anxiety, her hat on
one side, her hands searching everywhere, under the tablecloth, in
the basket, amongst the knives and forks.

"Jim, you haven't dropped anything?"

"No, mum. Beggin' your pardon, mum, the basket was closed, so to
speak--closed it was."

No, she knew that she had forgotten it.

"I'm so sorry, Mrs. Le Page, I'm afraid--"

"My dear Mrs. Cole! What does it matter? Not in the least, I assure
you. In this heat it's impossible to feel hungry, isn't it? I assure
you I don't feel as though I could touch a thing. A little fruit,
perhaps--an apple or a peach--"

Fruit? Why hadn't Mrs. Cole brought fruit? She might so easily have
done so, and she had never thought about it. They themselves were
rather tired of fruit, and so--

"I'm afraid we've no fruit, but an egg-sandwich--"

"Eggs need salt, don't you think? Not that it matters in the very
least, but so that you shouldn't think me fussy. Really, dear Mrs.
Cole, I never felt less hungry in my life. Just a drop of milk and
I'm perfectly satisfied."

"Jeremy shall run up to the farm for the milk. You don't mind,
Jeremy dear, do you? It's only a step. Just take this sixpence,
dear, and say we'll send the jug back this afternoon if they'll
spare one."

Jeremy did mind. He was enjoying his luncheon, and he was gazing at
Charlotte, and he was teasing Hamlet with scraps--he was very happy.
Nevertheless, he started off.

So soon as he left the sands the noise of the sea was shut off from
him, and he was climbing the little green path up which the Scarlet
Admiral had once stalked.

Suddenly he remembered--in his excitement about Charlotte he had
forgotten the Admiral. He stood for a moment, listening. The green
hedge shut off the noise of the sea--only above his head some birds
were twittering. He fancied that he heard footsteps, then that
beyond the hedge something was moving. It seemed to him that the
birds were also listening for something. "Well, it's the middle of
the afternoon, anyway." He thought to himself, "He never comes
there--only in the morning or evening," but he hurried forward after
that, wishing that he had called to Hamlet to accompany him. It was
a pleasant climb to the farm through the green orchard, and he found
at the farm door an agreeable woman who smiled at him when she gave
him the milk. He had to come down the hill carefully, lest the milk
should be spilt. He walked along very happily, humming to himself
and thinking in a confused summer afternoon kind of manner of
Charlotte, Hamlet, Mrs. Le Page and himself. "Shall I give her the
thimble or shan't I? I could take her to the pools where the little
crabs are. She'd like them. I wonder whether we're going to bathe.
Mrs. Le Page will look funny bathing. . ." Then he was in the green
lane again, and at once his discomfort returned to him, and he
looked around his shoulder and into the hedges, and stopped once and
again to listen. There was no sound. The birds, it seemed, had all
fallen to sleep. The hedges, he thought, were closer about him. It
was very hot here, with no breeze and no comforting sound of the
sea. "I wonder whether he really does come," he thought. "It must be
horrid to see him--coming quite close." And the thought of the Fool
also frightened him. The Fool with his tongue out and his shaking
legs, like the idiot who lived near the Cathedral at home. At the
thought of this Jeremy suddenly took to his legs and ran, covering
the top of his jug with his hand; then, when he came out on to the
strip of grass that crossed the top of the beach, he stopped,
suddenly ashamed of himself. Scarlet Admirals! Scarlet Admirals! How
could there be Scarlet Admirals in a world that also contained so
blazing a sun, so blue a sea, and the gorgeous realities of the Le
Page family. He arrived at the luncheon party hot and proud and
smiling, so cheerful and stolid and agreeable that even Mrs. Le Page
was compelled to say, "Really, Mrs. Cole, that's a very nice little
boy of yours. Come here, little Jeremy, and talk to me!" How deeply
he hated being called "little Jeremy" only Mary and Helen knew.
Their eyes flew to his face to see how he would take it. He took it
very well. He sat down beside Mrs. Le Page, who very gracefully and
languidly sipped at her glass of milk.

"How old are you, Jeremy dear?" she asked him.

"Eight," he answered, wriggling.

"What a nice age! And one day you'll go to school?"

"In September."

"And what will you be when you're a man?"

"Oh, I don't know. I'll be a soldier, perhaps."

"Oh, I'm sure you wouldn't like to be a soldier and kill people."

"Yes, I would. There's lots of people I'd like to kill."

Mrs. Le Page drew her skirts back a little.

"How horrible! I'm sure your mother wouldn't like to hear that."

But Mr. Cole had caught the last words of the dialogue and
interrupted with:

"But what could be finer, Mrs. Le Page, than the defence of one's
country? Would you have our young lads grow up faint-hearted and
fail their Motherland when she calls? What can be finer, I say, than
to die for Queen and country? Driven on by their infuriated officers,
they again reach our wire network. Our Captain commands, "Fire
at will." Then, "Fire at repetition, fire until the magazine is
exhausted." Just as the Germans, in wavering, hesitating groups,
presenting vague outlines, try to cut our networks they tumble
over like marionettes.

Already some of our men, intoxicated with fury, stand up in the
trenches.

Our Captain commands, "En avant à la baionnette!" ("At them with
bayonet.") A fierce roar from our chests, and the only bugler left
alive in our company sounds the charge.

Away we go with our bayonets.

We scarcely reach them when the bouches are put to rout. Some of
them escape helter-skelter, throwing down rifles and knapsacks.

"Halt!" commands our Captain. We lie down and keep up the firing
on the retreating remnants of the enemy. "Back to the trenches!"
is the next command. A few more volleys in the direction of the
Germans, then comes the command, "Cease firing. Take your haversacks,
eat, and rest." All becomes silent again except for the harrowing
moans of the wounded. We learn that the German assault has been
repulsed all along the line.
Their losses must have been awful.

5 A.M.--Gray, misty dawn breaks from behind the orme trees. Soon
we are able to see what has happened.

Over three hundred bouches are on the ground in front of our company's
trench, lying dead or wounded.

Our cooks with their soup pots get out of our hole and go to the
rear to prepare in the underground kitchens our well-earned coffee
and cabbage soup. Our Captain rubs his hands with satisfaction.

A strong patrol goes out of our trenches to reconnoitre the
enemy's positions in the pine wood. The rest of us try to get some
sleep.

The Germans as Seen from a Convent

[From The London Times, Aug. 16, 1914.]

_Some interesting sidelights on the events of the past fortnight in
Belgium are provided by extracts from the diary of a young English
girl, Miss Lydia Evans, who has just returned from a convent school
at Fouron, near Visé. The following are among the entries in this
graphic narrative, published in The Evening News:_ 
Aug. 2.

--All the people of the village passed down with cows, calves,
horses, hay, &c., which they were obliged to send in for the Belgian
Army near Liége.

The first troop of Prussians came into the village this afternoon on
the pretense of having a horse shod.

Aug. 3.

--Two more troops of soldiers arrived. The Prussians slept at our
convent, some in the park, others on beds in the recreation room.
The reverend mother put everything at their disposal.

They asked nicely, but gave the impression that if refused they would
take more. We all went to bed at 10 o'clock. Everybody got an
alarm to dress half an hour afterward. We came down and found the
place full of Germans, who were exceedingly polite. They are
magnificent. The meanest soldier is perfectly equipped, everything
perfectly new, and splendid horses.

They are like theatre soldiers, they are so perfect. They were awfully
nice, and talked a lot.

Aug. 4.

--Between Monday and Tuesday there was a terrible fight between the
Germans and Belgians at Visé because the Belgians would not let
the Germans pass to get to Liége.

The Belgians blew up several big bridges between Visé and Liége,
also the one at Visé.

Aug. 5.--One man told us all the villagers had left except himself.

The German soldiers were here all day, but are very polite. They
always bow and salute.

We hear a terrible noise at Visé of bombardment, and a great fusillade
in the convent. A wounded man was brought to the convent.

Aug. 6.--A curate near here has been shot. The Germans are very nice
if you give them what they want, but if they are refused the pistol
comes out.

Old Mother Thérèse was at the door when a soldier asked her for a
kettle. She refused, and he nearly shot her.

Aug. 7.--A most fearful noise was heard about 2 o'clock. They say
that it was a fort blown up. A German aeroplane passed yesterday.
The soldiers are camping in the woods.

There are seven wounded here.

Nearly all the others are taken to Aix-la-Chapelle.

Aug. 8.--Went to mass in the village. A man told us that the Germans
had burned two big farms at Warsage (the next village.)

Two women and two men arrived from Liége.

They said that the people had been living in caves for the last two
days and nights.

These poor people saw awful sights in coming across the fields, which
were covered with dead. We have heard that Berneau is burned and
the women and children hung.

The Germans are furious at having lost such a number of men
before seeing the French.

A soldier passed last night, and Maria lifted up a corner of the
curtain.

In a minute he had out his revolver and threatened to shoot her. Some
of the soldiers opposite the convent were drunk.

Aug. 9.--An aeroplane passed right over us, and seemed to drop
something white. The soldiers are going about in bands destroying
and laying waste every house and garden."He is," cried Charlotte with a kind of wail. "Oh! I want to go
home."

"Well, you can't go home," he answered her fiercely. "So you needn't
think about it."

They came to the little pools, three of them, now clear as crystal,
blue on their surface, with green depths and red shelving rock.

"Now you sit there," he said cheerfully. "No one will touch you. The
crabs won't get at you."

He looked about him and noticed with surprise where he was. He was
sitting on the farther corner of the very beach where the Scarlet
Admiral had landed with his men. It was out there beyond that bend
of rock that the wonderful ship had rode, with its gold and silk,
its jewelled masts and its glittering board. Directly opposite to
him was the little green path that led up the hill, and above it the
very field--Farmer Ede's field!

For a long, long time they sat there in silence. He forgot Charlotte
in his interest over his discovery, staring about him and watching
how quickly the August afternoon was losing its heat and colour, so
that already a little cold autumnal wind was playing about the sand,
the colours were being drawn from the sky, and a grey web was slowly
pulled across the sea.

"Now," he said cheerfully at last, to Charlotte, "I'll look for the
crabs."

"I hate crabs," she said. "I want to go home."

"You can't go home," he answered furiously. "What's the good of
saying that over and over again? You aren't going yet, so it's no
use saying you are."

"You're a horrid little boy," she brought out with a kind of
inanimate sob.

He did not reply to that; he was still trying to behave like a
gentleman. I_three_ take" me offers before,, he pityingly--" grounds

crabs that weren't there he felt his temper growing. Soon he would
lead her back to her mother and leave her there and never see her
again.

But this was not the climax of the afternoon.

When he looked up from gazing into the pool the whole world seemed
to have changed. He was still dazzled perhaps by the reflection of
the water in his eyes, and yet it was not altogether that. It was
not altogether because the day was slipping from afternoon into
evening.

The lazy ripple of the water as it slutched up the sand and then
broke, the shadows that were creeping farther and farther from rock
to rock, the green light that pushed up from the horizon into the
faint blue, the grey web of the sea, the thick gathering of the
hills as they crept more closely about the little darkening beach .
. . it was none of these things.

He began hurriedly to tell Charlotte about the Scarlet Admiral. Even
as he told her he was himself caught into the excitement of the
narration. He forgot her; he did not see her white cheeks, her mouth
open with terror, an expression new to her, that her face had never
known before, stealing into her eyes. He told her how the Fool had
seen the ship, how the Admiral had landed, then left his men on the
beach, how he had climbed the little green path, how the young man
had followed him, how they had fought, how the young man had fallen.
Nov. 12--Queen Mary visits the American Women's War Hospital at
Paignton, Devonshire.

Nov. 13--Two American Red Cross units in Germany; two more Rockefeller
Foundation relief ships to sail.

Nov. 17--Ambassador von Bernstorff presents statement to Secretary
Bryan that Germany welcomes American assistance for Belgians.

Nov. 18--Cardinal Mercier sends appeal to America for help for
Belgians.

Nov. 20--Cardinal Farley directs special collection for war
sufferers.
Nov. 22--Kansas to give 50,000 barrels of flour.
Nov. 23--Rockefeller Foundation will rush relief to wide area; it
is planned to send supplies to Austria, Servia, and Russia; Massapequa
unloaded at Rotterdam.They dragged her out, but alas! what a sight was
there! Instead of the beautiful and magnificent Charlotte there was
a bedraggled and dirty little girl.

But also, instead of an inanimate and lifeless doll, there was at
last a human being, a terrified soul.

The scene that followed passes all power of description. Mrs. Le
Page wailed like a lost spirit; Mr. Le Page was so rude to Mr. Cole
that it might confidently be said that those two gentlemen would
never speak to one another again. Mrs. Cole, dismayed though she
was, had some fatalistic consolation that she had known from the
first that the picnic would be a most dreadful failure and that the
worst had occurred; there was no more to come.

Young Joudon is dead; they have pillaged everything. I have come back
from Gerbervillers, which is destroyed. The brutes!

Now, my dear brother, make the sacrifice of your life.

We have hope of seeing you again, for something gives me a presentiment
and tells me to hope.

We embrace you in all our hearts. Adieu and au revoir, if God
permits.

THY SISTER.

It is for us and for France.
Think of your brothers and of grandfather in '70.

him? If not the Scarlet Admiral, then the other.
