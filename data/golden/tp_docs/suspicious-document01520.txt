After some further discussion, the Bishop took up Barron's letter again.
"I see there is likely to be a most painful scene at the Church Council
meeting--which of course will be also one of their campaign meetings--the
day after to-morrow. Barron declares that he means to challenge Meynell
publicly to vindicate his character. Can I do anything?"

Dornal did not see anything could be done. The parish was already in open
rebellion.

Before the war the population of Germany and Austria-Hungary together not
only substantially exceeded that of the United States, but was
about equal to that of the whole of North America.

In these numbers, situated within a compact territory, lay the
military strength of the Central Powers.

But these same numbers--for even the war has not appreciably
diminished them[2]--if deprived of the means of life, remain a
hardly less danger to European order.

European Russia increased her population in a degree even greater
than Germany--from less than 100,000,000 in 1890 to about 150,000,000
at the outbreak of war;[3] and in the year immediately preceding
1914 the excess of births over deaths in Russia as a whole was at
the prodigious rate of two millions per annum.

This inordinate growth in the population of Russia, which has not been
widely noticed in England, has been nevertheless one of the most
significant facts of recent years.

The great events of history are often due to secular changes in the
growth of population and other fundamental economic causes, which,
escaping by their gradual character the notice of contemporary
observers, are attributed to the follies of statesmen or the
fanaticism of atheists.

       Thus the extraordinary occurrences of the past two years in Russia,
that vast upheaval of Society, which has overturned what seemed
most stable--religion, the basis of property, the ownership of land,
as well as forms of government and the hierarchy of classes--may
owe more to the deep influences of expanding numbers than to Lenin
or to Nicholas; and the disruptive powers of excessive national
fecundity may have played a greater part in bursting the bonds of
convention than either the power of ideas or the errors of
autocracy.

II. _Organization_
The delicate organization by which these peoples lived depended
partly on factors internal to the system.

The interference of frontiers and of tariffs was reduced to a minimum,
and not far short of three hundred millions of people lived within the
three Empires of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. The various
currencies, which were all maintained on a stable basis in relation
to gold and to one another, facilitated the easy flow of capital
and of trade to an extent the full value of which we only realize now,
when we are deprived of its advantages.

Over this great area there was an almost absolute security of property and
of person.

These factors of order, security, and uniformity, which Europe had never
before enjoyed over so wide and populous a territory or for so
long a period, prepared the way for the organization of that vast
mechanism of transport, coal distribution, and foreign trade which
made possible an industrial order of life in the dense urban centers
of new population.

       This is too well known to require detailed substantiation with
figures.

But it may be illustrated by the figures for coal, which has been the key
to the industrial growth of Central Europe hardly less than of England;
the output of German coal grew from 30,000,000 tons in 1871 to
70,000,000 tons in 1890, 110,000,000 tons in 1900, and 190,000,000
tons in 1913.

Round Germany as a central support the rest of the European economic
system grouped itself, and on the prosperity and enterprise of Germany
the prosperity of the rest of the Continent mainly depended. The
increasing pace of Germany gave her neighbors an outlet for their
products, in exchange for which the enterprise of the German merchant
supplied them with their chief requirements at a low price.

The statistics of the economic interdependence of Germany and her neighbors
are overwhelming. Germany was the best customer of Russia, Norway,
Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria-Hungary; she was the
second best customer of Great Britain, Sweden, and Denmark; and the third
best customer of France.

She was the largest source of supply to Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Roumania, and Bulgaria;
and the second largest source of supply to Great Britain, Belgium,
and France.

In our own case we sent more exports to Germany than to any other country
in the world except India, and we bought more from her than from
any other country in the world except the United States.

There was no European country except those west of Germany which
did not do more than a quarter of their total trade with her; and in the
case of Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Holland the proportion was far
greater.

Germany not only furnished these countries with trade, but, in the case
of some of them, supplied a great part of the capital needed for
their own development. Of Germany's pre-war foreign investments, amounting
in all to about $6,250,000,000, not far short of $2,500,000,000 was
invested in Russia, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Roumania, and
Turkey.[4] And by the system of "peaceful penetration" she gave
these countries not only capital, but, what they needed hardly less,
organization.

The whole of Europe east of the Rhine thus fell into the German industrial
orbit, and its economic life was adjusted accordingly.

But these internal factors would not have been sufficient to enable
the population to support itself without the co-operation of external
factors also and of certain general dispositions common to the whole of
Europe. Many of the circumstances already treated were true of Europe as
a whole, and were not peculiar to the Central Empires.

But all of what follows was common to the whole European system.

III. _The Psychology of Society_
Europe was so organized socially and economically as to secure the maximum
accumulation of capital.

While there was some continuous improvement in the daily conditions
of life of the mass of the population, Society was so framed as to throw
a great part of the increased income into the control of the class least
likely to consume it. The new rich of the nineteenth century were
not brought up to large expenditures, and preferred the power which
investment gave them to the pleasures of immediate consumption. In fact,
it was precisely the _inequality_ of the distribution of wealth which
made possible those vast accumulations of fixed wealth and of
capital improvements which distinguished that age from all others.

Herein lay, in fact, the main justification of the Capitalist
System. If the rich had spent their new wealth on their own enjoyments,
the world would long ago have found such a régime intolerable. But like
bees they saved and accumulated, not less to the advantage of the
whole community because they themselves held narrower ends in
prospect.

The immense accumulations of fixed capital which, to the great benefit
of mankind, were built up during the half century before the war,
could never have come about in a Society where wealth was divided
equitably.

The railways of the world, which that age built as a monument to posterity,
were, not less than the Pyramids of Egypt, the work of labor which was
not free to consume in immediate enjoyment the full equivalent of
its efforts.

Thus this remarkable system depended for its growth on a double bluff or
deception.

On the one hand the laboring classes accepted from ignorance or powerlessness,
or were compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom, convention, authority,
and the well-established order of Society into accepting, a situation
in which they could call their own very little of the cake that they and
Nature and the capitalists were co-operating to produce. And on the
other hand the capitalist classes were allowed to call the best
part of the cake theirs and were theoretically free to consume it,
on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very little
of it in practice.

       The duty of "saving" became nine-tenths of virtue and the growth
of the cake the object of true religion.

There grew round the non-consumption of the cake all those instincts of
puritanism which in other ages has withdrawn itself from the world
and has neglected the arts of production as well as those of enjoyment.
And so the cake increased; but to what end was not clearly
contemplated.
Individuals would be exhorted not so much to abstain as to defer, and to
cultivate the pleasures of security and anticipation. Saving was for
old age or for your children; but this was only in theory,--the virtue
of the cake was that it was never to be consumed, neither by you
nor by your children after you.

In writing thus I do not necessarily disparage the practices of that
generation. In the unconscious recesses of its being Society knew
what it was about. The cake was really very small in proportion
to the appetites of consumption, and no one, if it were shared
all round, would be much the better off by the cutting of it. Society
was working not for the small pleasures of to-day but for the future
security and improvement of the race,--in fact for "progress." If only
the cake were not cut but was allowed to grow in the geometrical proportion
predicted by Malthus of population, but not less true of compound
interest, perhaps a day might come when there would at last be
enough to go round, and when posterity could enter into the enjoyment
of _our_ labors.

In that day overwork, overcrowding, and underfeeding would have come to
an end, and men, secure of the comforts and necessities of the body, could
proceed to the nobler exercises of their faculties. One geometrical ratio
might cancel another, and the nineteenth century was able to forget the
fertility of the species in a contemplation of the dizzy virtues of compound
interest.

There were two pitfalls in this prospect: lest, population till outstripping
accumulation, our self-denials promote not happiness but numbers; and
lest the cake be after all consumed, prematurely, in war, the
consumer of all such hopes.

But these thoughts lead too far from my present purpose.

I seek only to point out that the principle of accumulation based
on inequality was a vital part of the pre-war order of Society and
of progress as we then understood it, and to emphasize that this principle
depended on unstable psychological conditions, which it may be impossible
to recreate. It was not natural for a population, of whom so few enjoyed
the comforts of life, to accumulate so hugely. The war has disclosed the
possibility of consumption to all and the vanity of abstinence to
many.

Thus the bluff is discovered; the laboring classes may be no longer willing
to forego so largely, and the capitalist classes, no longer confident
of the future, may seek to enjoy more fully their liberties of consumption
so long as they last, and thus precipitate the hour of their confiscation.

IV. _The Relation of the Old World to the New_
The accumulative habits of Europe before the war were the necessary
condition of the greatest of the external factors which maintained the
European equipoise.

Of the surplus capital goods accumulated by Europe a substantial part
was exported abroad, where its investment made possible the
development of the new resources of food, materials, and transport,
and at the same time enabled the Old World to stake out a claim in
the natural wealth and virgin potentialities of the New.

This last factor came to be of the vastest importance. The Old World employed
with an immense prudence the annual tribute it was thus entitled
to draw. The benefit of cheap and abundant supplies resulting from the
new developments which its surplus capital had made possible, was,
it is true, enjoyed and not postponed.

But the greater part of the money interest accruing on these foreign
investments was reinvested and allowed to accumulate, as a reserve
(it was then hoped) against the less happy day when the industrial
labor of Europe could no longer purchase on such easy terms the
produce of other continents, and when the due balance would be
threatened between its historical civilizations and the multiplying
races of other climates and environments.

Thus the whole of the European races tended to benefit alike from the
development of new resources whether they pursued their culture
at home or adventured it abroad.

Even before the war, however, the equilibrium thus established
between old civilizations and new resources was being threatened.

The prosperity of Europe was based on the facts that, owing to the large
exportable surplus of foodstuffs in America, she was able to purchase
food at a cheap rate measured in terms of the labor required to
produce her own exports, and that, as a result of her previous
investments of capital, she was entitled to a substantial amount
annually without any payment in return at all.

The second of these factors then seemed out of danger, but, as a
result of the growth of population overseas, chiefly in the United
States, the first was not so secure.

When first the virgin soils of America came into bearing, the proportions
of the population of those continents themselves, and consequently
of their own local requirements, to those of Europe were very small.

As lately as 1890 Europe had a population three times that of North and
South America added together. But by 1914 the domestic requirements
of the United States for wheat were approaching their production, and
the date was evidently near when there would be an exportable
surplus only in years of exceptionally favorable harvest.

Indeed, the present domestic requirements of the United States are
estimated at more than ninety per cent of the average yield of the five
years 1909-1913.[5] At that time, however, the tendency towards stringency
was showing itself, not so much in a lack of abundance as in a steady
increase of real cost. That is to say, taking the world as a whole,
there was no deficiency of wheat, but in order to call forth an adequate
supply it was necessary to offer a higher real price. The most favorable
factor in the situation was to be found in the extent to which
Central and Western Europe was being fed from the exportable surplus
of Russia and Roumania.

In short, Europe's claim on the resources of the New World was becoming
precarious; the law of diminishing returns was at last reasserting itself
and was making it necessary year by year for Europe to offer a greater
quantity of other commodities to obtain the same amount of bread; and
Europe, therefore, could by no means afford the disorganization of any of
her principal sources of supply.

Much else might be said in an attempt to portray the economic
peculiarities of the Europe of 1914. I have selected for emphasis the three
or four greatest factors of instability,--the instability of an
excessive population dependent for its livelihood on a complicated and
artificial organization, the psychological instability of the laboring
and capitalist classes, and the instability of Europe's claim, coupled
with the completeness of her dependence, on the food supplies of the
New World.

The war had so shaken this system as to endanger the life of Europe altogether.
A great part of the Continent was sick and dying; its population was
greatly in excess of the numbers for which a livelihood was available;
its organization was destroyed, its transport system ruptured, and its
food supplies terribly impaired.

It was the task of the Peace Conference to honor engagements and to
satisfy justice; but not less to re-establish life and to heal wounds.

These tasks were dictated as much by prudence as by the magnanimity
which the wisdom of antiquity approved in victors.

We will examine in the following chapters the actual character of the
Peace.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] In 1913 there were 25,843 emigrants from Germany, of whom 19,124 went
to the United States.

[2] The net decrease of the German population at the end of 1918 by decline
of births and excess of deaths as compared with the beginning of 1914,
is estimated at about 2,700,000.

[3] Including Poland and Finland, but excluding Siberia, Central Asia,
and the Caucasus.

[4] Sums of money mentioned in this book in terms of dollars have been
converted from pounds sterling at the rate of $5 to £1.

[5] Even since 1914 the population of the United States has increased by
seven or eight millions. As their annual consumption of wheat per
head is not less than 6 bushels, the pre-war scale of production in the
United States would only show a substantial surplus over present
domestic requirements in about one year out of five.

We have been saved for the moment by the great harvests of 1918 and 1919,
which have been called forth by Mr.

Hoover's guaranteed price. But the United States can hardly be expected
to continue indefinitely to raise by a substantial figure the cost of
living in its own country, in order to provide wheat for a Europe
which cannot pay for it.

CHAPTER III
THE CONFERENCE

In Chapters IV. and V. I shall study in some detail the economic and
financial provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Germany.

But it will be easier to appreciate the true origin of many of these
terms if we examine here some of the personal factors which influenced
their preparation.

       In attempting this task, I touch, inevitably, questions of motive,
on which spectators are liable to error and are not entitled to
take on themselves the responsibilities of final judgment.

Yet, if I seem in this chapter to assume sometimes the liberties which
are habitual to historians, but which, in spite of the greater
knowledge with which we speak, we generally hesitate to assume
towards contemporaries, let the reader excuse me when he remembers
how greatly, if it is to understand its destiny, the world needs
light, even if it is partial and uncertain, on the complex struggle
of human will and purpose, not yet finished, which, concentrated
in the persons of four individuals in a manner never paralleled,
made them, in the first months of 1919, the microcosm of mankind.

In those parts of the Treaty with which I am here concerned, the lead
was taken by the French, in the sense that it was generally they who made
in the first instance the most definite and the most extreme proposals.
This was partly a matter of tactics. When the final result is
expected to be a compromise, it is often prudent to start from an extreme
position; and the French anticipated at the outset--like most other
persons--a double process of compromise, first of all to suit the
ideas of their allies and associates, and secondly in the course
of the Peace Conference proper with the Germans themselves.

These tactics were justified by the event. Clemenceau gained a
reputation for moderation with his colleagues in Council by sometimes
throwing over with an air of intellectual impartiality the more extreme
proposals of his ministers; and much went through where the American
and British critics were naturally a little ignorant of the true point
at issue, or where too persistent criticism by France's allies put
them in a position which they felt as invidious, of always appearing
to take the enemy's part and to argue his case. Where, therefore, British
and American interests were not seriously involved their criticism grew
slack, and some provisions were thus passed which the French themselves
did not take very seriously, and for which the eleventh-hour decision
to allow no discussion with the Germans removed the opportunity of
remedy.

But, apart from tactics, the French had a policy. Although Clemenceau might
curtly abandon the claims of a Klotz or a Loucheur, or close his eyes
with an air of fatigue when French interests were no longer involved
in the discussion, he knew which points were vital, and these he abated
little.
Friends and
neighbours, let us keep our tongues from them--and our children's
tongues! Let us show that we can trust a man that deserves our trust. Let
us stand by a good man that's stood by us; and let us pray God to show
the right!"

The greater part of the audience, sincerely moved, rose to their feet and
cheered. Barron endeavoured to reply, but was scarcely listened to. The
publican East sat twirling his hat in his hands, sarcastic smiles going
out and in upon his fat cheeks, his furtive eyes every now and then
consulting the tall spinster who sat beside him, grimly immovable, her
spectacled eyes fixed apparently on the lamp above the platform.

Flaxman wished to speak, but was deterred by the reflection that as a
newcomer in the district he had scarcely a valid right to interfere. He
and Rose stayed till the vote of confidence had been passed by a large
majority--though not so large as that which had accepted the new
Liturgy--after which they drove home rather depressed and ill at ease.
For in truth the plague of anonymous letters was rather increasing than
abating. Flaxman had had news that day of the arrival of two more among
their own country-house acquaintance of the neighbourhood. He sat down,
in obedience to a letter from Dornal, to write a doleful report of the
meeting to the Bishop.

       *       *       *       *       *

Meynell received the vote of confidence very calmly, and wrote a short
note of thanks to Beswick. Then for some weeks, while the discussion of
his case in its various aspects, old and new, ran raging through England,
he went about his work as usual, calm in the centre of the whirlwind,
though the earth he trod seemed to him very often a strange one. He
prepared his defence for the Court of Arches; he wrote for the
_Modernist_; and he gave as much mind as he could possibly spare to the
unravelling of Philip Meryon's history.

In this matter, however, he made but very slow and disappointing
progress. He became more and more convinced, and his solicitor with him,
that there had been a Scotch marriage some eighteen months before this
date between Meryon and the sister of a farmer in the Lothians, with whom
he had come in contact during a fishing tenancy. But what appeared in the
course of investigation was that the woman concerned and all her kindred
were now just as anxious--aided by the ambiguities of the Scotch marriage
law--to cover up and conceal the affair as was Meryon himself. She could
not be got to put forward any claim; her family would say nothing; and
the few witnesses hitherto available were tending to disappear. No doubt
Philip was at work corrupting them; and the supposed wife was evidently
quite willing, if not eager, to abet him.

Every week he heard from Mary, letters which, written within bounds fully
understood by them both and never transgressed, revealed to him the
tremulous tenderness and purity of the heart he knew--though he would not
confess it to himself--he had conquered. These letters became to him the
stay of life, the manna which fed him, the water of healing and strength.
It was evident that, according to his wish, she did not know and was
determined not to know the details of his struggle; and nothing helped
him more than the absolute trust of her ignorance.

He heard also constantly from Alice Puttenham. She, too, poor soul--but
how differently!--was protecting herself as best she could from an odious
knowledge.

"Edith writes to me, full of terrible things that are being said in
England; but as I can do nothing, and must do nothing according to you, I
do not read her letters. She sends me a local newspaper sometimes, scored
with her marks and signs that are like shrieks of horror, and I put it in
the fire. What I suffer I will keep to myself. Perhaps the worst part of
every day comes when I take Hester out and amuse her in this gay Paris.
She is so passionately vital herself, and one dreads to fail her in
spirits or buoyancy.

"She is very well and wonderfully beautiful; at present she is having
lessons in dancing and elocution, and turning the heads of her teachers.
It is amusing--or would be amusing, to any one else than me--to see how
the quiet family she is with clucks after her in perpetual anxiety, and
how cavalierly she treats them. I think she is fairly happy; she never
mentions Meryon's name; but I often have a strange sense that she is
looking for some one--expects some one. When we turn into a new street,
or a new alley of the Bois, I have sometimes seemed to catch a wild
_listening_ in her face. I live only for her--and I cannot feel that it
matters to her in the least whether I do or not. Perhaps, some day.
Meanwhile you may be sure I think of nothing else. She knows nothing of
what is going on in England--and she says she adores Paris."

       *       *       *       *       *

One night in December Meynell came in late from a carpentering class of
village boys. The usual pile of letters and books awaited him, and he
began upon them reluctantly. As he read them, and put them aside, one
by one, his face gradually changed and darkened. He recalled a saying of
Amiel's about the French word "consideration"--what it means to a man to
have enjoyed unvarying and growing "consideration" from his world; and
then, suddenly, to be threatened with the loss of it. Life and
consciousness drop, all in a moment, to a lower and a meaner plane.

Finally, he lit on a letter from one of his colleagues on the Central
Modernist Committee. For some months it had been a settled thing that
Meynell should preach the sermon in Dunchester Cathedral on the great
occasion in January when the new Liturgy of the Reform was to be
inaugurated with all possible solemnity in one of England's most famous
churches.

His correspondent wrote to suggest that after all the sermon would be
more fitly entrusted to the Modernist Bishop of Dunchester himself. "He
has worked hard, and risked much for us. I may say that inquiries have
been thrown out, and we find he is willing."

No apology--perfunctory regrets--and very little explanation! Meynell
understood.

He put the letter away, conscious of a keenly smarting mind. It was now
clear to him that he had made a grave misreckoning; humiliating, perhaps
irreparable. He had counted, with a certain confident simplicity, on
the power of his mere word, backed by his character and reputation, to
put the thing down; and they were not strong enough. Barron's influence
seemed to him immense and increasing. A proud and sensitive man forced
himself to envisage the possibility of an eventual overthrow.

He opened a drawer in order to put away the letter. The drawer was very
full, and in the difficulty of getting it out he pulled it too far and
its contents fell to the floor. He stooped to pick them up--perceived
first the anonymous letter that Barron had handed to him, the letter
addressed to Dawes; and then, beneath it, a long envelope deep in
dust--labelled "M.B.--Keep for three years." He took up both letter and
envelope with no distinct intention. But he opened the anonymous letter,
and once more looked searchingly at the handwriting.

Suddenly an idea struck him. With a hasty movement, he lifted the long
envelope and broke the seal. Inside was a document headed, "A
Confession." And at the foot of it appeared a signature--"Maurice
Barron."

Meynell put the two things together--the "confession" and the anonymous
letter. Very soon he began to compare word with word and stroke with
stroke, gradually penetrating the disguise of the later handwriting.
At the end of the process he understood the vague recollection which had
disturbed him when he first saw the letter.

He stood motionless a little, expressions chasing each other across his
face. Then he locked up both letters, reached a hand for his pipe, called
a good night to Anne, who was going upstairs to bed, and with his dogs
about him fell into a long meditation, while the night wore on.


CHAPTER XIX


It was in the week before Christmas that Professor Vetch--the same
Professor who had been one of the Bishop's Commission of Inquiry in
Richard Meynell's case--knocked one afternoon at Canon France's door to
ask for a cup of tea. He had come down to give a lecture to the Church
Club which had been recently started in Markborough in opposition to the
Reformers' Club; but his acceptance of the invitation had been a good
deal determined by his very keen desire to probe the later extraordinary
developments of the Meynell affair on the spot.

France was in his low-ceiled study, occupied as usual with drawers full
of documents of various kinds; most of them mediaeval deeds and charters
which he was calendaring for the Cathedral Library. [91] substantial

caught her brother looking contentedly at his work of mischief. But she
dared not speak of it to him, nor do anything to repair the damage.

As France perceived the identity of the visitor whom his old manservant
was showing into the study, a slight shade of annoyance passed over his
face. But he received the Professor civilly, cleared a chair of books in
order that he might sit down, and gave a vigorous poke to the fire.

The Professor did not wish to appear too inquisitive on the subject of
Meynell, and he therefore dallied a little with matters of Biblical
criticism. France, however, took no interest whatever in them; and even
an adroit description of a paper recently read by the speaker himself
at an Oxford meeting failed to kindle a spark. Vetch found himself driven
upon the real object of his visit.
