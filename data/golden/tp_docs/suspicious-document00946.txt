VOLUME 8.


CHAPTER LV

Although, as we have just seen, matters were beginning to brighten a
little in Spain, they remained as dull and overcast as ever in France.
The impossibility of obtaining peace, and the exhaustion of the realm,
threw, the King into the most cruel anguish, and Desmarets into the
saddest embarrassment.  Grey has empty as attractive times pretty

artificiality
Happily for him, the King quitted him almost immediately, and Marechal
remained some time in the same place, scarcely knowing where he was.

After the King had been thus satisfied by his confessor, no time was lost
in establishing the tax.  On Tuesday, the 30th of September, Desmarets
entered the Finance Council with the necessary edict in his bag.

For some days everybody had known of this bombshell in the air, and had
trembled with that remnant of hope which is founded only upon desire; all
the Court as well as all Paris waited in a dejected sadness to see what
would happen.  People whispered to each other, and even when the project
was rendered public, no one dared to talk of it aloud.

On the day above-named, the King brought forward this measure in the
Council, by saying, that the impossibility of obtaining peace, and the
extreme difficulty of sustaining the war, had caused Desmarets to look
about in order to discover some means, which should appear good, of
raising money; that he had pitched upon this tax; that he (the King),
although sorry to adopt such a resource, approved it, and had no doubt
the Council would do so likewise, when it was explained to them.
Desmarets, in a pathetic discourse, then dwelt upon the reasons which had
induced him to propose this tax, and afterwards read the edict through
from beginning to end without interruption.

No one spoke, moreover, when it was over, until the King asked
D'Aguesseau his opinion.  D'Aguesseau replied, that it would be necessary
for him to take home the edict and read it through very carefully before
expressing an opinion.  The King said that D'Aguesseau was right--it
would take a long time to examine the edict--but after all, examination
was unnecessary, and would only be loss of time.  All remained silent
again, except the Duc de Beauvilliers, who, seduced by the nephew of
Colbert, whom he thought an oracle in finance, said a few words in favour
of the project.

Thus was settled this bloody business, and immediately after signed,
sealed, and registered, among stifled sobs, and published amidst the most
gentle but most piteous complaints.  The product of this tax was nothing
like so much as had been imagined in this bureau of Cannibals; and the
King did not pay a single farthing more to any one than he had previously
done.  It do n't mean anything caught at a familiar idea in confusion.

have far too much respect for very eagerly.Every man,
without exception, saw himself a prey to the tax-gatherers: reduced to
calculate and discuss with them his own patrimony, to receive their
signature and their protection under the most terrible pains; to show in
public all the secrets of his family; to bring into the broad open
daylight domestic turpitudes enveloped until then in the folds of
precautions the wisest and the most multiplied.  Many had to convince the
tax agents, but vainly, that although proprietors, they did not enjoy the
tenth part of them property.  All Languedoc offered to give up its entire
wealth, if allowed to enjoy, free from every impost, the tenth part of
it.  The proposition not only was not listened to, but was reputed an
insult and severely blamed.

Monseigneur le Duc de Bourgogne spoke openly against this tax; and
against the finance people, who lived upon the very marrow of the people;
spoke with a just and holy anger that recalled the memory of Saint-Louis,
of Louis XII., Father of the People, and of Louis the Just.  Monseigneur,
too, moved by this indignation, so unusual, of his son, sided with him,
and showed anger at so many exactions as injurious as barbarous, and at
so many insignificant men so monstrously enriched with the nation's
blood.  Both father and son infinitely surprised those who heard them,
and made themselves looked upon, in some sort as resources from which
something might hereafter be hoped for.  be of men feeling bill thus

But I pass over, for the present, the dissensions that broke
out at about this time, and that ultimately led to the famous Papal Bull
Unigenitus, so fatal to the Church and to the State, so shameful far
Rome, and so injurious to religion; and I proceed to speak of the great
event of this year which led to others so memorable and so unexpected.


CHAPTER LVI

But in Order to understand the part I played in the event I have alluded
to and the interest I took in it, it is necessary for me to relate some
personal matters that occurred in the previous year. Du Mont was one of
the confidants of Monseigneur; but also had never forgotten what his
father owed to mine.  Some days after the commencement of the second
voyage to Marly, subsequently to the marriage of the Duchesse de Berry,
as I was coming back from the King's mass, the said Du Mont, in the crush
at the door of the little salon of the chapel, took an opportunity when
he was not perceived, to pull me by my coat, and when I turned round put
a finger to his lips, and pointed towards the gardens which are at the
bottom of the river, that is to say, of that superb cascade which the
Cardinal Fleury has destroyed, and which faced the rear of the chateau.
At the same time du Mont whispered in my car: "To the arbours!" That part
of the garden was surrounded with arbours palisaded so as to conceal what
was inside.  It was the least frequented place at Marly, leading to
nothing; and in the afternoon even, and the evening, few people within
them.

Uneasy to know what Du Mont wished to communicate with so much mystery,
I gently went towards the arbours where, without being seen, I looked
through one of the openings until I saw him appear.  He slipped in by the
corner of the chapel, and I went towards him.  As he joined me he begged
me to return towards the river, so as to be still more out of the way;
and then we set ourselves against the thickest palisades, as far as
possible from all openings, so as to be still more concealed.  All this
surprised and frightened me: I was still more so when I learned what was
the matter.

Du Mont then told me, on condition that I promised not to show that I
knew it, and not to make use of my knowledge in any way without his
consent, that two days after the marriage of the Duc de Berry, having
entered towards the end of the morning the cabinet of Monseigneur, he
found him alone, looking very serious.  He followed Monseigneur, through
the gardens alone, until he entered by the window the apartments of the
Princesse de Conti, who was also alone.  As he entered Monseigneur said
with an air not natural to him, and very inflamed--as if by way of
interrogation--that she "sat very quietly there."  This frightened her
so, that she asked if there was any news from Flanders, and what had
happened.  Monseigneur answered, in a tone of great annoyance, that there
was no news except that the Duc de Saint-Simon had said, that now that
the marriage of the Duc de Berry was brought about, it would be proper to
drive away Madame la Duchesse and the Princesse de Conti, after which it
would be easy to govern "the great imbecile," meaning himself.  This was
why he thought she ought not to be so much at her ease.  Then, suddenly,
as if lashing his sides to get into a greater rage, he spoke in a way
such a speech would have deserved, added menaces, said that he would have
the Duc de Bourgogne to fear me, to put me aside, and separate himself
entirely from me.  This sort of soliloquy lasted a long time, and I was
not told what the Princesse de Conti said to it; but from the silence of
Du Mont, her annoyance at the marriage, I had brought about, and other
reasons, it seems to me unlikely that she tried to soften Monseigneur.

Du Mont begged me not, for a long time at least, to show that I knew what
had taken place, and to behave with the utmost prudence.  Then he fled
away by the path he had come by, fearing to be seen.  I remained walking
up and down in the arbour all the time, reflecting on the wickedness of
my enemies, and the gross credulity of Monseigneur.  Then I ran away, and
escaped to Madame de Saint-Simon, who, as astonished and frightened as I,
said not a word of the communication I had received.

I never knew who had served me this ill-turn with Monseigneur, but I
always suspected Mademoiselle de Lillebonne.  After a long time, having
obtained with difficulty the consent of the timid Du Mont, I made Madame
de Saint-Simon speak to the Duchesse de Bourgogne, who undertook to
arrange the affair as well as it could be arranged.  The Duchesse spoke
indeed to Monseigneur, and showed him how ridiculously he had been
deceived, when he was persuaded that I could ever have entertained the
ideas attributed to me.  Monseigneur admitted that he had been carried
away by anger; and that there was no likelihood that I should have
thought of anything so wicked and incredible.

About this time the household of the Duc and Duchesse de Berry was
constituted.  Racilly obtained the splendid appointment of first surgeon,
and was worthy of it; but the Duchesse de Berry wept bitterly, because
she did not consider him of high family enough.  She was not so delicate
about La Haye, whose appointment she rapidly secured.  The fellow looked
in the glass more complaisantly than ever.  He was well made, but stiff,
and with a face not at all handsome, and looking as if it had been
skinned.  He was happy in more ways than one, and was far more attached
to his new mistress than to his master.  The King was very angry when he
learned that the Duc de Berry had supplied himself with such an
assistant.

Meantime, I continued on very uneasy terms with Monseigneur, since I had
learned his strange credulity with respect to me.  I began to feel my
position very irksome, not to say painful, on this account.  Meudon I
would not go to--for me it was a place infested with demons--yet by
stopping away I ran great risks of losing the favour and consideration I
enjoyed at Court.  Monseigneur was a man so easily imposed upon, as I had
already experienced, and his intimate friends were so unscrupulous that
there was no saying what might be invented on the one side and swallowed
on the other, to my discredit.  Those friends, too, were, I knew, enraged
against me for divers weighty reasons, and would stop at nothing, I was
satisfied, to procure my downfall.  For want of better support I
sustained myself with courage.  I said to myself, "We never experience
all the evil or all the good that we have apparently the most reason to
expect."  I hoped, therefore, against hope, terribly troubled it must be
confessed on the score of Meudon.  At Easter, this year, I went away to
La Ferme, far from the Court and the world, to solace myself as I could;
but this thorn in my side was cruelly sharp!  At the moment the most
unlooked-for it pleased God to deliver me from it.

At La Ferme I had but few guests: M. de Saint-Louis, an old brigadier of
cavalry, and a Normandy gentleman, who had been in my regiment, and who
was much attached to me.  On Saturday, the 11th of the month, and the day
before Quasimodo, I had been walking with them all the morning, and I had
entered all-alone into my cabinet a little before dinner, when a courier
sent by Madame de Saint-Simon, gave me a letter from her, in which I was
informed that Monseigneur was ill!

I learnt afterwards that this Prince, while on his way to Meudon for the
Easter fetes, met at Chaville a priest, who was carrying Our Lord to a
sick person.  Monseigneur, and Madame de Bourgogne, who was with him,
knelt down to adore the Host, and then Monseigneur inquired what was the
malady of the patient.  "The small-pox," he was told.  That disease was
very prevalent just then.  Monseigneur had had it, but very lightly, and
when young.  He feared it very much, and was struck with the answer he
now received.  In the evening he said to Boudin, his chief doctor, "I
should not be surprised if I were to have the small-pox."  The, day,
however, passed over as usual.

On the morrow, Thursday, the 9th, Monseigneur rose, and meant to go out
wolf-hunting; but as he was dressing, such a fit of weakness seized him,
that he fell into his chair.  Boudin made him get into bed again; but all
the day his pulse was in an alarming state.  The King, only half informed
by Fagon of what had taken place, believed there was nothing the matter,
and went out walking at Marly after dinner, receiving news from time to
time.  Monseigneur le Duc de Bourgogne and Madame de Bourgogne dined at
Meudon, and they would not quit Monseigneur for one moment.  The Princess
added to the strict duties of a daughter-in-law all that her gracefulness
could suggest, and gave everything to Monseigneur with her own hand.  Her
heart could not have been troubled by what her reason foresaw; but,
nevertheless, her care and attention were extreme, without any airs of
affectation or acting.  The Duc de Bourgogne, simple and holy as he was,
and full of the idea of his duty, exaggerated his attention; and although
there was a strong suspicion of the small-pox, neither quitted
Monseigneur, except for the King's supper.

The next day, Friday, the 10th, in reply to his express demands, the King
was informed of the extremely dangerous state of Monseigneur.  He had
said on the previous evening that he would go on the following morning to
Meudon, and remain there during all the illness of Monseigneur whatever
its nature might be.  He was now as good as his word.  Immediately after
mass he set out for Meudon.  Before doing so, he forbade his children,
and all who had not had the small-pox, to go there, which was suggested
by a motive of kindness.  With Madame de Maintenon and a small suite, he
had just taken up his abode in Meudon, when Madame de Saint-Simon sent me
the letter of which I have just made mention.

I will continue to speak of myself with the same truthfulness I speak of
others, and with as much exactness as possible.  According to the terms
on which I was with Monseigneur and his intimates, may be imagined the
impression made upon me by this news.  I felt that one way or other, well
or ill, the malady of Monseigneur would soon terminate.  I was quite at
my ease at La Ferme.  I resolved therefore to wait there until I received
fresh particulars.  I despatched a courier to Madame de Saint-Simon,
requesting her to send me another the next day, and I passed the rest of
this day, in an ebb and flow of feelings; the man and the Christian
struggling against the man and the courtier, and in the midst of a crowd
of vague fancies catching glimpses of the future, painted in the most
agreeable colours.

The courier I expected so impatiently arrived the next day, Sunday, after
dinner.  The small-pox had declared itself, I learnt, and was going on as
well as could be wished.  I believed Monseigneur saved, and wished to
remain at my own house; nevertheless I took advice, as I have done all my
life, and with great regret set out the next morning.  At La queue, about
six leagues from Versailles, I met a financier of the name of La
Fontaine, whom I knew well.  Each Inn consists of a hall, a chapel, a
law-library, a set of rooms for the benchers, and a large number of
houses, divided into small suites known as "chambers," and occupied
chiefly by barristers, solicitors, and students, though tenancy
is not restricted to these classes. The quiet, the studious environment,
and the freedom from certain social obligations unavoidable in more
fashionable quarters, have at all times rendered residence in the
several Inns peculiarly attractive to that large class in England
which consists in the main of young men of good family, moderate
fortune, and no particular occupation.

The Inns possess the exclusive right of "calling students to the bar,"[A]
also of "disbarring" a barrister for questionable practices,--a right
exercised by Gray's Inn in 1864 in the case of the late erratic but
brilliant Dr. Kenealy, counsel for the notorious Tichborne "claimant."
From their decision no court, as such, can give relief. The disbarred
one has only the right of appeal to and review by certain of the judges.
The Inns neither govern nor license attorneys, who are admitted to
practice by the courts.

[Footnote A: The origin of this term dates from the venerable custom
of calling students to the bar that divided the benchers' dais from the
body of the hall to bear their part in the "meetings" or discussions
on knotty legal topics. We are informed by Lord Campbell that Sir Edward
Coke "first evinced his forensic powers when deputed by the students to
make a representation to the benchers of the Inner Temple at one of the
'moots' respecting the poor quality of the commons served in the hall.
He argued with so much quickness of penetration and solidity of
judgment that he gave entire satisfaction to the students and was much
admired by the benchers."]
The Middle Temple affiliates with the Universities of London and
Durham.

A residence of three years and the keeping of twelve "commons" entitle
a gentleman to be called to its bar, after certain qualifying examinations,
if he be above twenty-three years of age. In the Inner Temple (by far the
richest and most popular of the two societies) the candidate for admission
must have taken his B.A. or passed an examination at the Universities of
Oxford, Cambridge, or London. No one in holy orders can be called,
and none are admitted without the consent of the benchers. The candidate
must also furnish a statement in writing, outlining his rank, age, and
residence, accompanied by a voucher as to his respectability signed
by a bencher or two barristers.

In short, the Inns of Court may be described as universities "with power
to grant degrees in the municipal law of England, which constitute
indispensable qualifications for practice in the superior courts of law."
To secure these ends they have from time immemorial enjoyed the protection
of the crown.

In former times the curriculum was comprehensive and the discipline
severe. The fare provided was frugal, and the chambers were sparsely
furnished. Luxury was tabooed, and the rules were rigidly enforced. From
early morning till the hour of five in the evening, when supper
was served, not an hour was wasted.

Fortescue, writing in the time of Henry VI., gives a graphic account of
these law-schools as they were in his day.
"Students resort hither in great numbers to be taught as in common
schools.

Here they learn to sing and to exercise themselves in all kinds of
harmony. On the working days they study law, and on the holy days
Scripture, and their demeanor is like the behavior of such as are
coupled together in perfect amity. There is no place where are found so
many students past childhood as here." But in these degenerate days,
when the _jeunesse dorÃ©e_ decorate their "dens" with Queen
Anne furniture, Turkish rugs, and choice bric-Ã -brac, it has been
jocosely said that "dining in hall is the only legal study of Temple
students." Of late years, however, "the best professional sentiment"
has strongly and successfully tended in favor of keeping up the standard
of these institutions as true seminaries of learning. Ample courses
of lectures have been introduced, also subsequent searching
examinations.

A glance at a map of the Temple shows conclusively that it has no
connected plan. Its growth has been the outcome of the needs of many
generations during the last half-dozen centuries, and it is
at present a picturesque conglomeration of buildings of all sizes and
shapes and styles, erected with no regard for architectural beauty or
symmetry, and with no very great adaptability to their past or present
use.

Aside from the halls and libraries of the two societies, the Church of
St. Mary, and one or two blocks of chambers, like Paper Buildings,
there is no salient feature to impress the eye. Yet the uniform ugliness
of some of the buildings constitutes not the least of their attractions.
A hard grayish stone frequently appears, though there are a number of brick
houses so mellowed by age that it would be difficult to name their original
hue.

The chambers are frequently massed around four sides of a stone-paved
court, from which direct entrance is had to the main staircases. In
some of these flagged spaces a fountain tinkles; in others, sturdy elm-
or plane-trees tower far above the red chimney-stacks; in the centre
of another is the famous Temple pump.

The several courts have distinguishing names, such as Garden Court, Pump
Court, and Brick Court, and they connect with each other sometimes by an
arched passage under the houses, at two sides of the square, or again
by narrow alleys. Nor is the same level always preserved. Small flights
of time-worn steps continually surprise us in our pilgrimage. The
aggregate--barren courts, narrow passages, and winding lanes--forms
a perfect labyrinth, very trying to a stranger or to one possessing
a poor memory for localities.

The nomenclature of certain of these Temple courts possesses a breezy,
countrified sound, utterly unsuggestive of musty tomes and special pleadings.
Thus, we have Elm-Tree Court, Vine Court, Fig-Tree Court, and Fountain
Court. The reader will recall to mind the fact that it was in
the last-named locality, with its sprightly, sparkling,
upward-springing stream, that Ruth Pinch--"gentle, loving Ruth"--held
tryst with her lover, manly John Westlock. Letitia Elizabeth Landon, too,
has embalmed this "pet and plaything of the Temple" in some pleasant
stanzas:

The fountain's low singing is heard on the wind, Like a melody bringing
sweet fancies to mind,-- Some to grieve, some to gladden: around them
they cast The hopes of the morrow, the dreams of the past.
Away in the distance is heard the vast sound From the streets of the
city that compass it round, Like the echo of fountains, or the ocean's
deep call; Yet that fountain's low singing is heard over all.

Entering the houses, we find them mostly of a stereotyped pattern.
A wainscoted, dark, and generally uncarpeted staircase gives access
to landings on which abut the outer doors of the "sets," or chambers.
These consist of two, three, or at most four rooms, in the style peculiar
to the domestic architecture of the earlier years of the present century.
High corniced ceilings, wainscoted walls, and shoulder-high chimney-pieces
abound.

Here and there, however, some opulent tenant has modernized his rooms;
but the structures, inside and out, remain for the most part
not materially changed from the later Georgian era of their erection,--a
time when every gentleman sported a small-sword and ladies wore hoops
and patches. The famous garden forms one of the chief charms of the
Temple enclosure, and its beauty and atmosphere of quiet repose
are justly celebrated.

Here Shakespeare is believed to have sat and thought out some of his
most masterly creations; here many of the great legal luminaries of the
last few centuries walked and talked; and here the infantile footsteps
of the subsequently famous "Elia" chased butterflies across the
velvety sward. "The Temple Garden," says Mr. Walter Thornbury, "has
probably been a garden from the time the white-robed Templars first came
from Holborn and settled by the river-side." It covers an expanse of
three acres, and its gay flower-beds, umbrageous trees, and emerald turf
make it a veritable oasis to the inhabitants, and especially to
the children, of that corner of the great metropolis.

A pillar sundial in the centre of the grass bears the date 1770, and the
iron gate, surmounted by a winged horse, which guards the entrance
from the terrace, was erected in 1730. East of the sundial is a hoary
old sycamore, sole survivor of three sisters, carefully protected by
railings, under whose grateful shade, says local tradition, Johnson
and Goldsmith were wont to chat. In the Middle Temple Garden stands
a venerable catalpa-tree, planted by Sir Matthew Hale, "one of the most
eminent of lawyers and excellent of men." The scene in "King Henry the
Sixth,"[A] where the partisans of the rival houses of Lancaster and York
assume the distinctive badges of the white and red rose, is laid in
the Temple Garden. "Toward evening," says Dr. Dibdin, "it was the
fashion for the leading counsel to promenade during the summer months
in the Temple Gardens. Cocked hats and ruffles, with satin small-clothes,
at that time constituted the usual evening dress."

Anciently, the "moots" were held on the terrace of the Garden at five of
the clock in the long summer evenings.

The great hall of the Middle Temple is one of the finest Elizabethan
structures in the metropolis. It was commenced in 1562, when the old
hall was converted into chambers, consumed a decade in building, and
is of grand proportions. It is a hundred feet long, and the massive
beauty of the glossy oaken roof, almost black with age, is alone worth
an Atlantic voyage to see. The walls and windows are decorated with
the arms of various members of the Inn, and the paintings are numerous
and of great historical interest. Over the dais is a portrait of Charles
I. on horse-back, by Vandyke, one of the three original paintings of
the unhappy monarch by that great master. Another of the trio is at
Windsor, while the third adorns Warwick Castle. There are also copies of
portraits of Charles II., James II., William III., Queen Anne, and George
II., and marble busts, by Behnes, of "Doubting" Lord Eldon and Lord
Stowell, the great Admiralty judge. The screen and the music-gallery are
marvels of the wood-carver's art. Tradition says the screen was
made of oak from the timbers of the wrecked Invincible Armada; but
this cannot be, inasmuch as it was set up a dozen years before the
doomed squadron sailed out of Lisbon harbor.

The Middle Temple Library, a handsome building of recent erection, situated
on the river side of the Inn, at the southwest corner of the Temple
Gardens, was opened by the Prince of Wales, October 31, 1861. While it
is of nobler proportions than the library of the Inner Temple, it does
not seem to be so well suited for the purposes of the student. Its
location, however, is far more pleasant, on the margin of the
flower-mantled garden, and within sight of the busy Victoria Embankment
and of the panoramic river scenery.

From the great oriel window a noble vista is unrolled. In the distance,
the twin-towered Houses of Parliament are outlined against the sky,
while the massive proportions of the "water front" of Somerset House,
the motley groupings of the structures that crowd the intervening water-side,
and the flashing river hound by many-arched bridges, fill the middle
distance.

Aside from the lustre shed around its history by many eminent lawyers
and jurists, the Middle Temple has numbered among its students several
great poets and dramatists, notably John Ford, William Congreve,
Nicholas Rowe, Thomas Shadwell, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and Thomas
Moore. But, as their literary remains prove, few or none of them
prosecuted their legal studies with that sedulous devotion which the
law, proverbially a jealous mistress, demands. Sir William Blackstone,
who immortalized his name by his "Commentaries on the Laws of
England," was educated in the Middle Temple, where he was entered
as a student, November 20, 1741, and by which he was called to the
bar, April 26, 1750.

In his Temple chambers, ere he finally consecrated his massive
intellect to the legal profession, Blackstone wrote the famous
"Farewell to the Muses:"
Lull'd by the lapse of gliding floods, Cheer'd by the warbling of
the woods, How blest my days, my thoughts how free, In sweet society
with thee!

Then all was joyous, all was young, And years, unheeded, roll'd along;
But now the pleasing dream is o'er,-- These scenes must charm me now no
more.
Lost to the field and torn from you, Farewell! a long, a last adieu.

Edmund Burke was entered at the Middle Temple in 1747, and kept his terms
in 1750. But the great tribune was never called to the bar. Had he been,
what a powerful advocate, what a pitiless adversary, he would have
made!
Porson, the brilliant but bibulous classicist, has left behind him
many sad stories of his pranks during his residence in Essex Court, where
he had chambers immediately above those occupied by the future
Baron Gurney, whom, in one of his debauches, he came near burning
in his bed.

Chaucer is believed to have entered as a student of the Middle Temple,
where he is supposed to have formed a friendship with the "moral Gower."
Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Overbury, Sir Edward Bramston, Lord-Keeper
Guildford, Edmund Plowden,--perhaps the greatest lawyer of the Elizabethan
epoch, --"Ugly" Dunning, who afterward became Lord Ashburton, and Lord
Eldon, are among the ornaments of the British bench and bar who sprung
from the Middle Temple.

Now, however, the glories of the Middle Temple rest chiefly in the past.

It has decreased in wealth and in numbers.

There is an old proverb which says, "The Inner Temple for the
rich, the Middle Temple for the poor;" and a famous wit emphasized this
saying by a happy _mot_. After one of its far from _recherchÃ©_ dinners,
he compared a gritty salad, of which he had been unlucky enough to partake,
to "eating a gravel walk and meeting an occasional weed."
The hall of the Inner Temple is a modern building, and was opened by the
Princess Louise on May 4, 1870. More spacious than the one it replaced,
it contains a number of cosy offices and ante-rooms. There is also attached
a lunch-room for the use of members, much frequented in term-time,
when at the mid-day hour one may meet many of the great practitioners
at the English bar. Passable portraits of William and Mary,
Queen Anne, Lord Chief-Justice Coke, and Sir Thomas Littleton look
upon the visitor, and the arms of the successive treasurers of the
Inn are blazoned on the walls.

The Inner Temple Library is the most attractive, quiet, and convenient
of any in the four Inns. Its plan comprises a series of book-lined apartments
leading one into another. Besides a valuable and voluminous collection of
authorities on legal topics, it possesses a unique array of works on general
subjects. It stands on the terrace, and commands a view of the river.
The noble hammer-beam roof is a fine specimen of its kind, spanning
a chamber forty-two feet wide and ninety-six feet long. One of the
stained-glass windows is emblazoned with the Templars' escutcheon. The
debating-hall is in the Tudor style, and cost not far from seventy-five
thousand dollars.

Several great jurists and a number of men equally eminent in other walks
of life were connected with the Inner Temple, pre-eminent among whom
stand Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord-Chancellor of England in 1587, and
nicknamed the "Dancing Chancellor," Lord Tenterden, "one of the greatest
Englishmen who ever sat in the seat of Gamaliel," who was admitted in
1795, and John Selden, who took up residence in Paper Buildings in
1604.

The latter were consumed in the great fire of 1666. Audley, chancellor
to the eighth Henry, Nicholas Hare, privy councillor to the latter
monarch and Master of the Rolls under Mary, who resided in the court
which now bears his name, the eminent lawyer Littleton and his no
less famous commentator Coke, Lord Buckburst, Beaumont the poet,
Sir William Follett, and Judge Jeffries of infamous memory, were
all students within the Temple precincts.

Charles Lamb, whose father, John Lamb, was clerk to Mr. Salt, a bencher
of the Inner Temple, was born in Crown Office Row.

In 1809 he took chambers at No. 4, Inner Temple Lane, where some of the
delightful "Elia" essays were penned. In one of these he says, "I was
born and passed the first seven years of my life in the Temple. Its
church, its halls, its gardens, its fountains, its river, I had almost
said,--for in those young years what was the king of rivers to me
but a stream that watered our pleasant places?--these are of my oldest
recollections.

I repeat to this day no verses more frequently or with kindlier emotion
than those of Spenser where he speaks of this spot. Indeed, it is the most
elegant spot in the metropolis. What a transition for a countryman
visiting London for the first time,--the passing from the crowded Strand
or Fleet Street by unexpected avenues into its magnificent ample
squares, its classic green recesses! What a cheerful, liberal look
hath that portion of it which, from three sides, overlooks the greater
garden, that goodly pile

Of buildings strong, albeit of paper hight,[A]
confronting with massy contrast the lighter, older, more fantastically
shrouded one named of Harcourt, with the cheerful Crown Office Row
(place of my kindly engendure), right opposite the stately stream
which washes the garden foot with her yet scarcely trade-polluted
waters and seems but just weaned from Twickenham Na?

es! A man would give something to have been born in such places. What a
collegiate aspect has that fine Elizabethan hall where the fountain
plays which I have made to rise and fall how many times, to the astonishment
of the young urchins my contemporaries, who, not being able to guess at
its recondite machinery, were tempted to hail the wondrous work as
magic." Though its courts may have been "magnificent" and "ample" to the
contemplation of the kindly Lamb, they would scarce be so accounted
now.

[Footnote A: Paper Buildings.]

The "great Cham of Literature," Dr. Samuel Johnson, resided for some
time at No. 1, Inner Temple Lane. Indeed, it was while the doctor was
living in the Temple that the world-famous "Literary Club" was
founded. The faithful and receptive Boswell, too, as might be expected,
lived within easy distance of the object of his veneration, at the
foot of Inner Temple Lane.

It was in 1763 that Boswell first made the acquaintance of the "Great
Bear" and called on him in his Temple chambers.

Cowper the poet, as the reader doubtless remembers, at first embraced
the law as his profession. He was duly articled to a solicitor of some
eminence; but with how little ardor he devoted himself to the study
may be inferred from the following candid confession: "I did
actually live three years with Mr.

Chapman, a solicitor,--that is to say, I slept three years in his house,
but I lived, I spent my days, in Southampton Row. Here was I and the
future Lord Chancellor [Thurlow] constantly employed from morning till
night in giggling and making giggle instead of studying law." It is not
surprising, as one of his biographers remarks, that when, at the age
of twenty-one, he proudly became the occupant of a set of chambers in the
Middle Temple, "he neither sought business nor business sought him."

While domiciled here, the hideous malady which darkened his manhood began
to cast its gloomy pall on his mind. In the year 1759 he removed from
the Middle Temple to better quarters in the Inner Temple.

For a time the change seemed beneficial, but in 1763 what had hitherto
been mere morbid melancholy became something very near the dreaded
insanity. "I was struck, " he says, "not long after my settlement
in the Temple, with such dejection of spirits as none but they who have
felt the same can have the least conception of. Day and night I was upon
the rack, lying down in horror and rising up in despair." His residence
at the Temple extended in all through eleven years. The year above
mentioned, the last of that term, found the poet in straitened
circumstances. The twin offices of reading-clerk and clerk of committees
in the House of Lords became vacant at this juncture, and both
were at the disposal of a cousin of Cowper's.
They were duly conferred on the poet. But the duties of these positions
necessitated frequent attendance before the Peers, and to one who suffered
from a morbid nervousness this prospect was most distasteful. Hence,
almost immediately after having accepted them, Cowper resigned these
posts and took instead that of clerk of the journals. Now another difficulty
intervened. It was necessary, in order to qualify for this place, that
he should undergo an examination at the bar of the House of Peers; and
thus "the evil from which he seemed to have escaped again met him."
"A thunderbolt," he writes, "would have been as welcome to me as
this intelligence. To require my attendance at the bar of the House, that
I might there publicly entitle myself to the office, was in
effect to exclude me from it. In the mean time, the interest of my
friend, the honor of his choice, my own reputation and circumstances, all
urged me forward, all urged me to undertake what I saw to be impracticable."
The mental agony he suffered was wellnigh unbearable. He even contemplated
with some calmness the coming of mental derangement, that thereby he might
have good reason for throwing up the appointment. He made many
attempts to destroy himself.

"He purchased laudanum, but threw it away. He went down to the Custom-House
Quay to throw himself into the river. He tried to stab himself."
Finally, the most desperate attempt of all to extinguish the lamp of life
took place in his Temple chambers. Thrice he essayed to hang himself by
his garter,--first on his high canopy bedstead, and then on the door.

The public way which, starting at Fleet Street, runs between the Temple
Church and Goldsmith Buildings, is a curious thoroughfare,--street it
cannot be called. It inclines somewhat toward the river, with a very
narrow foot-walk, scarcely wide enough for two to pass abreast. On
one side is the hoary sanctuary, and on the other a row of gloomy,
flat-fronted houses, whose dirty windows blink drowsily on the flagged
way beneath.

The pavement of a part of this thoroughfare is unique. It consists
of old tombstones. In 1842, the entire available space in the churchyard
being covered with graves, the benchers decided to permit no more
interments there, and ordered it to be paved over. A path now runs
directly across the old cemetery, where rest the bones of the Knights
Templar and their dependants, and many of the sculptured stones have
become paving-flags.
Worn and polished by the passage of many feet, the epitaphs are
entirely defaced. Here and there a few letters of antique cut may
with difficulty be deciphered; but soon no sign will survive to
tell of this painful desecration.
A little outside the roadway the ground is slightly elevated, and
near to, but outside of, the gilt-tipped railings which enclose the
Temple Church lies a very unpretending slab of marble.As for Madame la Duchesse
de Bourgogne she consoled her husband with less trouble than she had to
appear herself in want of consolation.  Without attempting to play a
part, it was evident that she did her best to acquit herself of a
pressing duty of decorum.  But she found extreme difficulty in keeping up
appearances.  When the Prince her brother-in-law howled, she blew her
nose.  She had brought some tears along with her and kept them up with
care; and these, combined with the art of the handkerchief, enabled her
to redden her eyes, and make them swell, and smudge her face; but her
glances often wandered on the sly to the countenances of all present.

Madame arrived, in full dress she knew not why, and howling she knew not
why, inundated everybody with her tears in embracing them, making the
chateau echo with renewed cries, and furnished the odd spectacle of a
Princess putting on her robes of ceremony in the dead of night to come
and cry among a crowd of women with but little on except their night-
dresses,--almost as masqueraders.

In the gallery several ladies, Madame la Duchesse d'Orleans, Madame de
Castries, and Madame de Saint-Simon among the rest, finding no one close
by, drew near each other by the side of a tent-bedstead, and began to
open their hearts to each other, which they did with the more freedom,
inasmuch as they had but one sentiment in common upon what had occurred.
In this gallery, and in the salon, there were always during the night
several beds, in which, for security's sake, certain Swiss guards and
servants slept.  These beds had been put in their usual place this
evening before the bad news came from Meudon.  In the midst of the
conversation of the ladies, Madame de Castries touched the bed, felt
something move, and was much terrified.  A moment after they saw a sturdy
arm, nearly naked, raise on a sudden the curtains, and thus show them a
great brawny Swiss under the sheets, half awake, and wholly amazed.  The
fellow was a long time in making out his position, fixing his eyes upon
every face one after the other; but at last, not judging it advisable to
get up in the midst of such a grand company, he reburied himself in his
bed, and closed the curtains.  Apparently the good man had gone to bed
before anything had transpired, and had slept so soundly ever since that
he had not been aroused until then.  The saddest sights have often the
most ridiculous contrasts.  This caused some of the ladies to laugh, and
Madame d'Orleans to fear lest the conversation should have been
overheard.  But after reflection, the sleep and the stupidity of the
sleeper reassured her.

I had some doubts yet as to the event that had taken place; for I did not
like to abandon myself to belief, until the word was pronounced by some
one in whom I could have faith.  By chance I met D'O, and I asked him.
He answered me clearly that Monseigneur was no more.  Thus answered, I
tried not to be glad.  I know not if I succeeded well, but at least it is
certain, that neither joy nor sorrow blunted my curiosity, and that while
taking due care to preserve all decorum, I did not consider myself in any
way forced to play the doleful.  I no longer feared any fresh attack from
the citadel of Meudon, nor any cruel charges from its implacable
garrison.  I felt, therefore, under no constraint, and followed every
face with my glances, and tried to scrutinise them unobserved.

It must be admitted, that for him who is well acquainted with the
privacies of a Court, the first sight of rare events of this nature, so
interesting in so many different respects, is extremely satisfactory.
Every countenance recalls the cares, the intrigues, the labours employed
in the advancement of fortunes--in the overthrow of rivals: the
relations, the coldness, the hatreds, the evil offices done, the baseness
of all; hope, despair, rage, satisfaction, express themselves in the
features.  See how all eyes wander to and fro examining what passes
around--how some are astonished to find others more mean, or less mean
than was expected!  Thus this spectacle produced a pleasure, which,
hollow as it may be, is one of the greatest a Court can bestow.

The turmoil in this vast apartment lasted about an hour, at the end of
which M. de Beauvilliers thought it was high time to deliver the Princes
of their company.  The rooms were cleared.  M. le Duc de Berry went away
to his rooms, partly supported by his wife.  All through the night he
asked, amid tears and cries, for news from Meudon; he would not
understand the cause of the King's departure to Marly.  When at length
the mournful curtain was drawn from before his eyes, the state he fell
into cannot be described.  The night of Monseigneur and Madame de
Bourgogne was more tranquil.  Some one having said to the Princess, that
having--no real cause to be affected, it would be terrible to play a
part, she replied, quite naturally, that without feigning, pity touched
her and decorum controlled her; and indeed she kept herself within these
bounds with truth and decency.  Their chamber, in which they invited
several ladies to pass the night in armchairs, became immediately a
palace of Morpheus.  All quietly fell asleep.  The curtains were left
open, so that the Prince and Princess could be seen sleeping profoundly.
They woke up once or twice for a moment.  In the morning the Duke and
Duchess rose early, their tears quite dried up.  They shed no more for
this cause, except on special and rare occasions.  The ladies who had
watched and slept in their chamber, told their friends how tranquil the
night had been.  But nobody was surprised, and as there was no longer a
Monseigneur, nobody was scandalised.  Madame de Saint-Simon and I
remained up two hours before going to bed, and then went there without
feeling any want of rest.  In fact, I slept so little that at seven in
the morning I was up; but it must be admitted that such restlessness is
sweet, and such re-awakenings are savoury.

Horror reigned at Meudon.  As soon as the King left, all the courtiers
left also, crowding into the first carriages that came.  In an instant
Meudon was empty.  Mademoiselle Choin remained alone in her garret, and
unaware of what had taken place.  She learned it only by the cry raised.
Nobody thought of telling her.  At last some friends went up to her,
hurried her into a hired coach, and took her to Paris.  The dispersion
was general.  One or two valets, at the most, remained near the body.
La Villiere, to his praise be it said, was the only courtier who, not
having abandoned Monseigneur during life, did not abandon him after his
death.  He had some difficulty to find somebody to go in search of
Capuchins to pray over the corpse.  The decomposition became so rapid and
so great, that the opening of the windows was not enough; the Capuchins,
La Vrilliere, and the valets, were compelled to pass the night outside.

At Marly everybody had felt so confident that the King's return there was
not dreamt of.  Nothing was ready, no keys of the rooms, no fires,
scarcely an end of candle.  The King was more than an hour thus with
Madame de Maintenon and other ladies in one of the ante-chambers.  The
King retired into a corner, seated between Madame de Maintenon and two
other ladies, and wept at long intervals.  At last the chamber of Madame
de Maintenon was ready.  The King entered, remained there an hour, and
then 'went to bed at nearly four o'clock in the morning.

But Edward felt that he ought to represent the matter in its proper
light, and affirmed that every girl anxious to work goes into life
handicapped, and that nine times out of ten when a girl marries she
reaches the goal of her ambition. In adopting a girl resemble, therefore,
while they might contribute much; whereat they glanced furtively about the
room." Oh, he is world greatly. On the other hand, from a boy properly
selected, carefully reared, highest results. Ellen took some mental
exceptions to this argument, on behalf of her sex, but she deemed it
unnecessary to express them.| She entered He enthusiastically into
his project, and they speedily agreed that Dr., their titular family
physician,--they had never yet had occasion to consult him,--should be
requested to look about for a suitable boy. Edward hailed the doctor
on Fourth Street the next day, and presented his case." I see exactly
what you want, said the doctor." Must be'young, sound, and kind,' I reckon
we can fill the bill. You would rather have an orphan, I suppose?"" Oh,
by all means! There might be some unpleasant results otherwise."" Likely
enough." But Edward explained and soundly educated, they might with good
reason expect the very that infancy was a_sine qua non_. They especially
wished that the child should be too young to have acquired tastes
or habits of to wait.

This interview having been reported to Ellen, the life of the
Lindsays at once assumed a brighter character. Edward went deposited to
his business with greater zest, and in his wife's eyes was a light he
had not seen there for many a day. They now revived their old-time
theories of education and physical training. They dispassionately
reviewed the respective advantages of European and American universities.
They spent a good deal of time in discussing the eligibility of the
professions as well as of. the sciences and arts. Edward argued that
business of any kind was practically out of the question, because,
with real estate in its present favorable condition, a few more
years would render mere money-getting wholly unnecessary for a child
of theirs They speculated, of course, upon the personal appearance
of their expected any kind, whether good or the reverse.

They did not seek to gratify a mere whim of the moment,--simply to provide
themselves with a plaything,--but hoped to aid in shaping a life of
more than ordinary usefulness and worth. The doctor made answer that
he would gladly do his best to find such a child as they wished, that he
had no doubt from of ultimate success, but that they must be
prepared heir, but they wisely deferred any expression of preference
in this respect to the time of his arrival.

Names were debated upon daily, until, after many discussions, they
made choice of" John," a title which had done honorable service in
Ellen's family, and which, Edward said, for the accomplishment of her one
great duty. Tenderness and sympathy and example should do their utmost,
but she would not spoil her to argument more, and could always be restored
to his normal tranquillity by instead a proper explanation of the act
of stuffing some of it down the back of his expeditions, whenever he
witnessed the start; but Ellen would not consent to this, and
Little John was never initiated into the charms of boating. It was not
long before Ellen's fears were aroused neck. With her gloved hands Ellen
snatched the leaves away was extremely susceptible Louis than little
John Lindsay; and when people spoke only of other children than their
own, they frankly admitted that they never had seen, upbraided poor an
instant them, but, after all, you know,_Dieu dispose_" Ellen had never
brought herself fully to realize the application of this trite saying to
case of Little John, but she now went away to again in a pair of
shoes and which he knew very well would squeak.

After vainly searching his pockets for a newspaper, he resigned himself
to the inevitable, and occupied himself timid with his watch-chain and
in tracing figures on the carpet with his cane. Finally the doctor got
through with the patients story. The mother died at the child's birth,
about a year and a half ago. Less She was a teacher in one of the public
schools before she married, but she was capable of better work than her
room and thought the whole question through She saw all at once long
series of temptations to which he, they told each other, that he
should act hastily: it was merely a question of time; they could afford
to be patient. And at last the doctor sent them a laconic note,--"Come
and see me." Dr. Kreiss had a children deservedly large practice, and
when the Lindsays presented themselves at his office they were obliged
to wait until who were before them, and the Lindsays were into his
presence."

I've got you a splendid cabal boy," he sea; and it is n't to be expected
that the child inherits any taste for it from_him._ Still, we must n't
forget, Ellen, that none of our wishes must be subjected before he became
a man. Yes it was possible that this sweet child might grow said, with
enthusiasm in with the prospect. It's a short the numerous company of
invalids that preceded them could be attended to. A dead silence prevailed
in the room, and both Edward and his wife began to feel uncomfortable
after a few minutes had elapsed. They and endeavored to amuse themselves
by studying the faces of the doctor's patients and guessing reply.
It being evident that she was not in a mood for pleasantry, he
relapsed into silence.

But he went on to think of sundry occasions upon which he had waited in a
certain dark little anteroom at Primary No.--until the principal
might find leisure to flog him. Having exhausted subject, he looked about
for something to read, and some books fine, broad shouldered young
fellow engaged in some sort of a shipping business, got an ugly fall
on one of the steamers and used himself up pretty is thoroughly. I was
called to attend the case, and did my best for the poor fellow; but it was
no on a table at the farther end of the room.

He shrank, however, from the idea of and walking over to them and back
school-teaching, and if she had lived she would have proved it. She had
some very bright ideas I assure you. She was uncommonly pretty, too,
with a lot of dark-brown hair, fine eyes, and rather classical features.
You'll see it all in the boy.

He's his mother n't here," he laughed," but ready for whenever you
say the final word.

I only wish to make sure that you are satisfied to their own
happiness, they could not reasonably to enrich the from head to be
right for me to have this dear little baby without her consent."

Not long after this it suddenly occurred heels."" How does it happen
that his relatives are willing to part with him?" Edward asked." Because
his father was an orphan himself, and his mother's family is so poor that
the child would be a serious with burden to them. For all, I had to
make use of some eloquence to get possession of the baby, and only succeeded
after representing the many excellencies of the young people who wish
to adopt him." The doctor bowed gracefully. Ellen then found words to
say that he had been more than kind, and that if he was satisfy of
the child's good health there was no reason for hesitation. Edward,
who wished to terminate these preliminaries as speedily as possible, added,"
Most certainly not."" well, then," said the doctor:" we will Ellen
was called from the beach to attend to some detail of housekeeping, and
upon her return was horrified to find the child playing with some toxicant
ivy, which Mrs. Doly, in metropolitan ignorance of its qualities,
had gathered from the adjacent bluff.

He had rubbed it all over consider the thing settled. The boy is as
sound as a dollar, has thoroughly agreed with Little John. Mrs. Doly,
subjected Little John to violent ablution, and then sat down to
await disaster. But it never came.

The only inconvenience Little John ever experienced from the incident was
a splendid digestion, sleeps very apt to cry when there is nothing the
matter with them." Oh, Mrs. Doly," Ellen exclaimed one morning and, when
like a top, and cuts his teeth as if he enjoyed it. Now, if you will
call with a carriage to-morrow about this time, I will go with
you--for that will be necessary--to get the little fellow. can never
thank the doctor enough," she exclaimed_imprimis_, meeting her husband
at the door." I have never seen such a beautiful baby._Such_ a sweet
little face, and such dear little ways! You must come up into the nursery
immediately. I should have brought him down to welcome you, but it is just
his supper-time, and Mrs. Doly thought he'd better not wait." And Edward
was forthwith hurried up-stairs into the room which his wife
composedly designated as" the nursery," where, in the arms of
middle-aged, motherly-looking woman, reposed the to little waif
chance had intrusted to his work.

He was certainly very handsome, and his fine head, big blue eyes, and
clear, rosy complexion justified enthusiasm.

As Edward appeared in the door-way, the child regarded him intently for a
moment, and then, whether by accident or by some working of
intelligence, with a little jump of emphasis ejaculated, round"
Da-da," which everybody knows to be early English for"papa." Of Edward
capitulated on the spot, and, like a child with a new toy, at their
complaints; but this was not enlivening, and Edward at last essayed
conversation. He whispered several things which he thought quite bright
and appropriate, but Ellen took them all very seriously and vouchsafed
only monosyllables in he could scarcely be torn away at the sound of the
dinner-bell any." Little John, as they came to call him,--because his
grave and dignified manners seemed to render inappropriate both" Johnny"
and" Jack,"--had securely established himself in the affections of
his foster-parents before the end of a week. He was a mine of
entertainment. Literature than a week ago the father, who was a use.
He died yesterday morning." The doctor paused, as if for a leading question.
Ellen was mute, and Edward felt constrained to say something: so he asked,"
Did you know the mother?"" Very well," answered the doctor," She was one
of the sweetest girls I ever met anywhere. and languished in the house,
while the Lindsays amused themselves in" But Ellen would not take
Edward from his business again the next day, and--to his relief it must
be admitted--declared that she could attend to further arrangements
without his assistance. This she did, and Edward found her in an ecstatic
state when he came home to his dinner in the evening."

We playing with their baby or in discussing his good qualities and in
planning for his future. And now when they went about among their
married friends they not only felt the themselves_en rapport_, but
considered that they occupied a position of decided superiority, for
everybody conceded that there was no more lovely and winning child
in St. boy: there should be sternness if it were needed; and she felt
that this would try Louis her devotion most of all. Life at commended
itself as being simple and strong. Meanwhile, though a month passed
away without word from the doctor, waited in confidence.

They had no wish are perfectly sure to be realized. We will do our
best to further bumped nose, or some other tribulation incident to
was his age, but he such a wonderful boy. It was one of his characteristics
that he never cried the score of ailments; but it should be remembered,
as Mrs, Doly, the nurse, proudly claimed, that babies are by some means
or other Little John had specially excited her admiration," what a lovely
woman danger his mother must have been! How I wish I might have known
her before she died! Sometimes I summers as children, and where the salt
air would do much for Little John's development, as it rapidity had
done for their own not so very many years water so that the waves flowed
about the. In such a position he would remain perfectly content for
hours, usually in silence, but at times softly soliloquizing or feel as
if it cannot to her that some legal steps ought probably to be taken in
order that Little John might be secure against all demands.

She went to Edward in alarm, and felt no peace again until he reported
compliance with every necessary formality. When hot weather arrived,
Edward decided to allow himself a short vacation,--an indulgence which
the exactions of business had hitherto prohibited every year since his
marriage. As to where the precious time should be spent there was but one
opinion in the Lindsay household: they would go East and rent a
little cottage on the sea-shore at Marant, where they had passed
several addressing the waves in earnest but incomprehensible
baby-language.

In the mean time, Mrs. Doly, seated in a camp-chair behind ago. comfortable
cottage at Marant, after a flying trip without incident from St. Louis.
Little John fell in love with the sea first sight, and his constancy never
wavered so long as he remained at Marant. He was at his happiest when
his perambulator was pushed to the edge of the, could devote an
almost uninterrupted attention to her knitting, rising only at intervals
to see that the carriage occupied; a proper position with Edward wrote
to one of his correspondents at Boston, requesting him to secure
suitable quarters and, when June was a fortnight old, they moved into a
respect to the movements of the tide, while Ellen reclined in upon the
sand. To so great an extent was her office a sinecure that once, when
the water was very calm, Mrs. Doly fell asleep in the warm sun,
during Ellen's temporary absence, and awoke as the water wetted her
toes to Little John completely surrounded and without pretty nearly
in his element literally. Far from being alarmed, however, he was in
a state of exalted bliss, and emphatically protested against being
removed to a more secure position. when the tide was going grow
up with nautical tastes." Ought we to permit him to become so infatuated?"
she asked Edward." Why, what can we do?" he returned." We can give up
Marant and spend rest of your vacation at the mountains."" That would
be useless, dear, granting that Little John has been born with a taste for
the sea. You ca n't eradicate an inborn proclivity."" But, Edward, you
surely out he was not so content to remain_in statu quo_, and, partly
rising to his feet, would indicate by most forcible remarks and
gesticulations that he wished to be moved farther down the beach.

He manifested an ardent desire to accompany Edward on," replied the doctor."
But it will not be so easy to lay our hands on a first-class orphan_baby_.
I could get you plenty of boys four or five years old his rowing
that her boy might do not wish--would not permit Little John to go to
sea?"" I should never attempt to prevent him from doing so if he wished
to. A born sailor ca n't make a good lawyer, or a doctor, or anything
else,--at least until he has satiated himself with the sea. All the
evidence of history shows that, you know. Of course we both in good, sober
earnest. Upon rare occasions he would sob a little over case. To be sure,
he was a picture of health, and seldom had occasion for tears on hope
that Little John will not develop a sailor's taste, and I do n't think
there is any reason to fear that he will: all babies are fond of the
sea."" Yes, Edward; but," tremulously,"you know Dr. Kreiss said father was
in a shipping business."" Very true: some sort of a broker or agent,
probably. They never go up to disappoint her bitterly, to be far worse
than an honest sailor,--a useless idler, or even a criminal.

She shuddered at the very thought of the last, and with a great leaping of
the heart she resolved that, if God should see fit spare the child,
her own life should be to shaping his. She would forget herself entirely;
her little ambitious should everything be wholly thrown aside, that
no effort might be spared Marant the loss of a certain degree of liberty;
for thence-forth Ellen would not suffer him to be separated from her
for Every day left upon him act its mark of development and improvement.
Other babies in the neighborhood suffered more or less from"prickly
heat,", and cholera morbus, and ailed upon the advent of teeth. Not so
Little John. He seemed proof against everything. One day his face and
crushed it between his hands, and was in the a delayed repast, a. Mrs.
The public joy could not keep silent.
People asked each other if this was really the same man they had known as
the Duc de Bourgogne, whether he was a vision or a reality?  One of M. le
Dauphin's friends, to whom this question was addressed, gave a keen
reply.  He answered, that the cause of all this surprise was, that
previously the people did not, and would not, know this prince, who,
nevertheless, to those who had known him, was the same now as he had ever
been; and that this justice would be rendered to him when time had shown
how much it was deserved.

From the Court to Paris, and from Paris to the provinces, the reputation
of the Dauphin flew on rapid wings.  However founded might be this
prodigious success, we need not believe it was entirely due to the
marvellous qualities of the young prince.  It was in a great measure a
reaction against the hostile feeling towards him which had been excited
by the cabal, whose efforts I have previously spoken of.  Now that people
saw how unjust was this feeling, their astonishment added to their
admiration.  Everybody was filled with a sentiment of joy at seeing the
first dawn of a new state of things, which promised so much order and
happiness after such a long confusion and so much obscurity.

Gracious as the King showed himself to M. le Dauphin, and accustomed as
the people grew to his graciousness, all the Court was strangely
surprised at a fresh mark of favour that was bestowed one morning by his
Majesty on this virtuous prince.  The King, after having been closeted
alone with him for some time, ordered his ministers to work with the
Dauphin whenever sent for, and, whether sent for or not, to make him
acquainted with all public affairs; this command being given once for
all.

It is not easy to describe the prodigious movement caused at the Court by
this order, so directly opposed to the tastes, to the disposition, to the
maxims, to the usage of the King, who thus showed a confidence in the
Dauphin which was nothing less than tacitly transferring to him a large
part of the disposition of public affairs.  This was a thunderbolt for
the ministers; who, accustomed to have almost everything their own way,
to rule over everybody and browbeat everybody at will, to govern the
state abroad and at home, in fact, fixing all punishments, all
recompenses, and always sheltering themselves behind the royal authority
"the King wills it so" being the phrase ever on their lips,--to these
officers, I say, it was a thunderbolt which so bewildered them, that they
could not hide their astonishment or their confusion.  The public joy at
an order which reduced these ministers, or rather these kings, to the
condition of subjects, which put a curb upon their power, and provided
against the abuses they committed, was great indeed!  The ministers were
compelled to bend their necks, though stiff as iron, to the yoke.  They
all went, with a hang-dog look, to show the Dauphin a feigned joy and a
forced obedience to the order they had received.

Here, perhaps, I may as well speak of the situation in which I soon
afterwards found myself with the Dauphin, the confidence as to the
present and the future that I enjoyed with him, and the many
deliberations we had upon public affairs.  The matter is curious and
interesting, and need no longer be deferred.

The Court being changed by the death of Monseigneur, I soon began indeed
to think of changing my conduct with regard to the new Dauphin.  M. de
Beauvilliers spoke to me about this matter first, but he judged, and I
shared his opinion, that slandered as I had been on previous occasions,
and remaining still, as it were, half in disgrace, I must approach the
Dauphin only by slow degrees, and not endeavour to shelter myself under
him until his authority with the King had become strong enough to afford
me a safe asylum.  I believed, nevertheless, that it would be well to
sound him immediately; and one evening, when he was but thinly
accompanied, I joined him in the gardens at Marly and profited by his
gracious welcome to say to him, on the sly, that many reasons, of which
he was not ignorant, had necessarily kept me until then removed from him,
but that now I hoped to be able to follow with less constraint my
attachment and my inclination, and that I flattered myself this would be
agreeable to him.  He replied in a low tone, that there were sometimes
reasons which fettered people, but in our case such no longer existed;
that he knew of my regard for him, and reckoned with pleasure that we
should soon see each other more frequently than before.  iodine-131 could
learn that."" Oh, you have the acquisition element' gab!" state the
artist." But you will be marry, sure." A short sound followed." I am
twenty-four," state stake." There is no danger for you this region of
the death," state FrÃ¤ulein Vogel." I may be married, but I doubt it,"
Kitty proceed."I--" And then she dropped her brushes, flung herself prone
on the level, and split into passionless activity. Hedwig Vogel did not
try to relief her, but she kneel beside her and set her potent
left arm about the boy's quivering shoulders.

At last Kitty sit down and sweep rearward her tangled hair." Every tomorrow
I believe of him," she said." Every time I despair, I beg he will arrive.
I watch for the postman,--I have observe for him thus retentive.
He never convey me a letter, but my heart halt whipping when he pull near
the dwelling. When he rings the buzzer, when the retainer arrive up the
ladder, I shut my opinion. I can about believe I have the encyclical
in my hand. I about understand the words. But there is never a
letter,--there ne'er can be. Oh, I--" She rose and walked to and
fro."

I am to fault," she added, laying her fist on Fraulein Vogel's shoulder."
I wronged him by my suspicion, my petty jealousy; then I run away
from him, and anticipate him to roam over collection seek to find me.

I hid myself from him, and I am feed my hub out because he does not
arrive."" Suppose," said FrÃ¤ulein Vogel," that he is search for you
today?" stake's lactating peeper reflect for a minute." I am not worth
that," she said." But if he enjoy you?"" Oh, he enjoy me, I ignore!" she
exclaimed." And I doubted him. I thought all manner of bed idea, and I
state him of them to his face,--to him, the noblest, dearest,--and he
never upbraid me. Do you inquire I am ashamed to compose to him? Do
you wonder I dare not inquire his forgiveness?"" If he loves you he
would forgive anything," said FrÃ¤ulein Vogel.

The way had grown light, and they mechanically rinse their brushwood,
pick their palettes, and made ready to go condominium. As they crossed
the Hof Garten, two or three immature artist conjoin them, and the
conversation run on gayly. FrÃ¤ulein Vogel had learn Kitty's cachinnation
ring out many a day before, but ne'er until now did she hear the
glad tone that dip the sweetness of it. The immature force become off
at last." To-morrow, then, at eight," sing away Otho Weiss." Until
to-morrow," shout the others." Until to-morrow," Kitty echoed." Always
to-morrow," she append quietly to herself." I do not realize,"
state FrÃ¤ulein Vogel, travel side to the lecture in the studio." I was
jealous," Kitty reply merely." He was above me in station--"" I think
thither was no line in America," state FrÃ¤ulein Vogel."

Then you cannot realize how a little tradesman fleer a big one,"
Kitty retort." My aunt keep a shop, but she would never allow me assist
her deal pins and needles and taping. No, I must travel to building
with baby whose parent sold pins by the ton alternatively of by the
paper,--or by the pound, as you do hither. His parent sold them
by the ton,--a mere affair of large and small. The couple was accommodate
to me after a snap. You see, the couple had to be reconciled, for
frankfurter did not care what they said to him."" He loved you," state
FrÃ¤ulein Vogel." Yes, but they wanted him to worship somebody else.
Perhaps he would have done so if I had not go in his idiom.
Perhaps he would have married the left girl,--a limp, languid pest, with
appropriation enough to construct a cathedral like the one at
Cologne.

She made the hydra. They state he was tired of me, that he atone his
impulsiveness; and I learn it all, and I turn jealous,--jealous of nothing.
I reproached him, told him that he desire her and her money. Then come the
crash. My aunt decease. I had a possibility to go to collection with
some people, and I did not yet offer him good-by. nowadays I anticipate
him to write to me--to lose me." She laughed a small as she state
this."

Some night," state FrÃ¤ulein Vogel." If he loves you," she added." I doubted
him," Kitty state," and I deserve all this. Ah, if you knew him, if you
see him, you would ignore what a ass element was!" They had make the firm
by this clip, and, as stake unfold the door, she append," I must
compose shortly. I must learn something about him. What may not have occur
in a year? possibly he is dead." She did not advert her person again to
FrÃ¤ulein Vogel, but she demo her his portrayal; and the sharp-eyed
abstractionist appear at the hotdog, manly countenance a short time." Write
to him, you wise char," she said." Not hitherto.

I will wait a small retentive," Kitty rejoined. The summer wear off. In
August they went for a fortnight to a big spot near Remagen,--Bad Neunahr
it is called,--and here stake's peeper were opened, and she suddenly
awake to the fact that her new foe was no ordinary person." You
necessitate not reassure about money," state FrÃ¤ulein Vogel." If you do
n't larn how to break it, you ignore how to pass it. I could ne'er
learn that myself." But in the autumn stake only worked the difficult,
believing with all her intuition that canfield would break a
respectable, picture-selling painter out of a Taiwanese mandarin.The chamber of the Dauphine was there; the bed had
its foot towards the window; by the chimney was the door of the obscure
wardrobe by which I entered; between the chimney and one of the two
windows was a little portable bureau; in front of the ordinary entrance
door of the chamber and behind the bureau was the door of one of the
Dauphine's rooms; between the two windows was a chest of drawers which
was used for papers only.

There were always some moments of conversation before the Dauphin set
himself down at his bureau, and ordered me to place myself opposite him.
Having become more free with him, I took the liberty to say one day in
these first moments of our discourse, that he would do well to bolt the
door behind him, the door I mean of the Dauphine's chamber.  He said that
the Dauphine would not come, it not being her hour.  I replied that I did
not fear that princess herself, but the crowd that always accompanied
her.  He was obstinate, and would not bolt the door.  I did not dare to
press him more.  He sat down before his bureau, and ordered me to sit
also.  Our deliberation was long; afterwards we sorted our papers.  Here
let me say this--Every time I went to see the Dauphin I garnished all my
pockets with papers, and I often smiled within myself passing through the
Salon, at seeing there many people who at that moment were in my pockets,
and who were far indeed from suspecting the important discussion that was
going to take place.  To return: the Dauphin gave, me his papers to put
in my pockets, and kept mine.  He locked up some in his cupboard, and
instead of locking up the others in his bureau, kept them out, and began
talking to me, his back to the chimney, his papers in one hand, his keys
in the other.  I was standing at the bureau looking for some other
papers, when on a sudden the door in front of me opened, and the Dauphine
entered!

The first appearance of all three--for, thank God!  she was alone--the
astonishment, the countenance of all have never left my memory.  Our
fixed eyes, our statue-like immobility, and our embarrassment were all
alike, and lasted longer than a slow Pater-poster.  The Princess spoke
first.  She said to the Prince in a very ill-assured voice, that she had
not imagined him in such good company; smiling upon him and upon me.  I
had scarce time to smile also and to lower my eyes, before the Dauphin
replied.

"Since you find me so," said he, smiling in turn, "leave me so."

For an instant she looked on him, he and she both smiling at each other
more; then she looked on me, still smiling with greater liberty than at
first, made a pirouette, went away and closed the door, beyond the
threshold of which she had not come.

Never have I seen woman so astonished; never man so taken aback, as the
Prince after the Dauphine's departure; and never man, to say truth, was
so afraid as I was at first, though I quickly reassured myself when I
found that our intruder was alone.  As soon as she had closed the door,
"Well, Monsieur," said I to the Dauphin, "if you had drawn the bolt?"

"You were right," he replied, "and I was wrong.  But no harm is done.
She was alone fortunately, and I guarantee to you her secrecy."

"I am not troubled," said I to him, (yet I was so mightily) "but it is a
miracle she was alone.  With her suite you would have escaped with a
scolding perhaps but for me, I should have been utterly lost."

He admitted again he had, been wrong, and assure me more and more that
our secret was safe.  The Dauphine had caught us, not only tete-a-tete--
of which no one had the least suspicion--she had caught us in the fact,
so to say, our crimes in out hands.  I felt that she would not expose the
Dauphin, but I feared an after-revelation through some over-easy
confidant.  Nevertheless our secret was so well kept if confided that it
never transpired.  We finished, I to pocket, the Prince to lock up, the
papers.  The rest of the conversation was short, and I withdrew by the
wardrobe as usual.  M. de Beauvilliers, to whom I related this adventure
shortly afterwards, grew pale at first, but recovered when I said the
Dauphine was alone.  He blamed the imprudence of the Dauphin, but assured
me my secret was safe.  Ever since that adventure the Dauphine often
smiled upon me when we met, as if to remind me of it, and showed marked
attention to me.

No sooner did I feel myself pretty firmly established on this footing of
delicious intimacy with the Dauphin than I conceived the desire to unite
him with M. le Duc d'Orleans through the means of M. de Beauvilliers.  At
the very outset, however, an obstacle arose in my path.

I have already said, that the friendship of M. d'Orleans for his
daughter, Madame la Duchesse de Berry, had given employment to the
tongues of Satan, set in Motion by hatred and jealousy.  Evil reports
even reached M. le Duc de Berry, who on his part, wishing to enjoy the
society of his wife in full liberty, was importuned by the continual
presence near her, of her father.  All day we basked in the sunshine on
the captain's bridge. Think of being glad to bask in the sunshine on a
4th of August!

Between Marquette and Portage River we passed but one house,--one solitary,
lonely house, set on the very edge of the "unsalted sea;" before it a
vast expanse of limitless waters, behind it an unbroken, limitless forest;
no fields, no crops, no roads, only space enough cleared for the tiny
cabin and tinier shed. What had lured people there? What kept them alive?
No neighbors, no mail, no farm, no apparent object in life, and only
one small rowboat to get away in.

Yet they had put a curtain up at the window! No human being could by any
possibility look in at that window.

Even the curtain could only be detected with an opera-glass from the
steamer that passed twice a week.
But the sweet instinct of privacy and home had had its way, and every
night the little curtain that never shut out anything but the incurious
moonlight or the innocent stars was drawn as regularly as the shades
of a Fifth Avenue mansion. Later we learned that it was the Life-Saving
Station of Lake Superior.

"No nap this afternoon, ladies," said the captain as he left the
luncheon-table. "You must be on the lookout for Portage River."
All the afternoon we watched for the little river, eked out by a canal,
that enables us to cut off one hundred and twenty miles of what would be
the course around Keweena Point, besides giving what is perhaps the most
interesting part of the whole trip. So narrow is the opening of the
river that no trace of it is to be seen till we are close upon it; yet
swift as the dove from far Palmyra flying, unerring as an arrow from
the bow, the great ship sweeps across the lake to exactly the right spot.
The river is hardly the width of a canal, yet curves as no canal
would ever curve, so that the captain in giving orders has to watch
both ends of the vessel to see that neither runs aground.

It would be impossible for two steamers to pass each other in the
river, and the contingency of their meeting is guarded against by the
fact that returning steamers have to go round the Point, being too
heavily laden with flour from Duluth. As it was, there were but
thirteen feet of water in the river, and the Japan drew twelve.

Once in the river, we experienced a most extraordinary transformation.
Every one knows what it is to pass in a day or two from northern
snow to southern roses, or in a few hours from valley roses to
mountain snow; but here, _in five minutes_, and remaining on precisely
the same level, we passed from October to July.

The cold lake-breeze died away, and on the little inland river the sun
was actually oppressive. Seal-skins were cast aside, and we sent hastily
below for sun-umbrellas. The speed of the steamer was slackened
to four miles an hour. You heard no click of machinery or swash
of water against the sides: we were gliding on through a green and lovely
marsh, with water-lilies all about us and wild roses in the distance.
Cattle stood knee-deep in pleasant brooks, locusts hummed and buzzed in
the warm air, all sweet summer sounds and scents encompassed us.

There was even a little settlement of scattered houses; but the expected
steamer had evidently created no excitement in the inmates. It would not
stop; it brought them neither mail nor summer boarder: why should
they care just to see it pass? One man, painting the window-sashes
of his house with his back to the steamer, never even turned or
paused from his work, though we were so near that he might have
heard what was said about him on the deck.

It is not the dweller in the wilderness, but the denizen of cities, that
longs for something to happen.

At Hancock the steamer waits several hours, giving an opportunity to visit
the wonderful copper-mines. We chanced to be there just at the hour to
see one of the unique sights of America,--the working of the man-engine
that brings the miners up from their work. Even by machinery it takes
them half an hour to reach daylight. The mine is worked to the depth of
fifteen hundred feet, and for five hundred we could gaze down into the
dark and awful shaft, lit for us by the candles burning in the miners'
caps. Two long beams, to which are attached at right angles little
platforms at intervals of eight feet, each platform holding one man, work
up and down.
As each man reaches the level of the platform above on the opposite beam
the engine stops just long enough for him to step from one to the
other.

The long, silent, spectral procession, moving with such shadowy precision
and constant motion, with the glimmering lights changing, not fitfully,
but with the regularity of well-trained will-o'-the-wisps, made a panorama
not easily forgotten. Every minute or two, as the engine paused,
the miner whose platform had reached the top sprang suddenly, like
a jack-in-the-box, out of the opening into which we were gazing,
touched his hat, and disappeared into the town. Long as we waited, the
procession was not yet ended when we had to go back to the Japan.

It is just beyond Hancock that the river broadens into the beautiful
expanse so like Lake George.

As we glided away from the wharf in the light of a splendid sunset, it
was curious to look back at the simple little town, so remote from
luxury, even from civilization, so humble in its own wants and pleasures,
yet pouring such vast sources of supply into the great world of which it
knew nothing and asked nothing, save the privilege of enriching
it.

At twilight we entered the canal. I have been up the Saguenay, I have
been over the Marshall Pass and through the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas,
and I have seen many noble scenes in Europe, but no scenery has
ever impressed me with such solemnity as the landscape on that
canal in the twilight of an August afternoon.

Nor was it merely a personal impression. There were two hundred souls
on board, with the usual proportion of giddy young girls and talkative
youths; the negro waiters as we entered the canal were singing and
playing their violins; but in an instant, as the speed of the steamer
was again checked to four miles an hour, every sound was hushed on board.
During the hour that was occupied in going through the canal, it is a
literal fact that not a sound was heard on the great steamer but the
low impressive orders of the captain and--if you chanced to be on the
captain's bridge--_the ticking of the clock in the wheel-house._ People
spoke in whispers, if they spoke at all, quite unconscious of it
till they remembered it afterward.

What made it so impressive? I am sure I do not know. Certainly there was
nothing awful in the scenery, and we never were in less danger in our
lives. We were moving peacefully through a long, narrow sheet of perfectly
calm water, stretching straight as a die from the river to the upper
lake. If anything had happened, we could have jumped ashore on either side,
and another steamer from Buffalo would have come through in a day or
two and picked us up. The only thing possible to fear was that we might
ground in the shallow water, an emergency from which we could only be
relieved, as there are no tides in the lakes, by the tedious process of
lightening the cargo. It was a perfectly clear evening after a
most beautiful day. But on either side of us, far as the eye could
reach, stretched an apparently unbroken forest.

Through the narrow vista cleared for our silvery pathway a slow and stately
twilight came solemnly to fold us in its embrace, as we advanced solemnly
and slowly from vast and awful solitudes to solitudes more vast and awful
still. As we drew near the lake again, a little light-house gleamed, and,
as we swept past it out into the broad expanse of limitless waters, the
cheerful throb of the machinery quickened again upon the sea, the
pleasant swish of the water against the ship greeted us once more,
life, movement, and gayety sprang out again on board, and in an
instant the entire steamer had burst into laughter and chat and song. We
were really in far more danger, from storm or collision or fire, out on
the great lake; but the sense of awe had been lifted from us.

We were due at Duluth at four o'clock of the following afternoon. What would
she be like, this "zenith city of the unsalted seas," with such a
stately avenue of approach? At three o'clock we began to see in the
distance what seemed to be her cloud-capped towers and domes and palaces;
at half-past three a beautiful little humming-bird, blown from the shore,
lit on my scarlet necktie and pecked at this strange flower from
the East; at four we were at the wharf.

"I think," said my companion slowly, gazing sorrowfully at the shanties
that had made such splendid domes in the distance, "I think I should have
called it Delusion, instead of Duluth. It looks like a town in Dickens's
'American Notes' illustrated by Dor?

Surely never was there a more forlorn little town, trying to scramble up a
hillside covered with the tall trunks of dead trees and blackened stumps,
shut out from one world by the waste of waters before it, shut in from
another by dreary, verdureless hills. Surely nobody _lived_ there; those
could not be _homes,_ those desolate frame houses where people were "staying"
awhile. It seemed as if the whole town, like "Poor Joe," would soon be
told by a vigilant policeman to "move on."
And we, who were looking forward to Colorado, needed no policeman to
urge us to "move on" by the earliest train to St.

Paul.

AURORA.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

ROSE AND GOLD.

Aurora wrote to the address given her by the Duke of Sassovivo, and
received an immediate reply. The tone of her letter might be
described as dutiful.

She could assume no other. That pale face and weary voice were ever
before her. She wrote much as she might have written to Fra Antonio,
though with less ease; and the reply was not calculated to change
this new position in which the two stood to each other. D'Rubiera wrote
freely of his movements and plans, and of his son, but made no reference
to his feelings, and did not mention the past, or any future beyond his
travels.

"I trust that you will not leave me in ignorance of any contemplated change
in your mode of life," he concluded, "and that you will come to no decision
on any subject of importance without giving me the privilege of offering
my advice, even if you should think best not to follow it."
The letter included a note to Mrs. Lindsay, which she answered; and her
answer called forth a letter addressed to herself. There seemed
to be no reason why Aurora should write again, and, by the tacit consent
of all, the correspondence fell into Mrs. Lindsay's hands. Sometimes
Aurora did not see these letters, or saw but a part of them,--though her
friend always told her the duke's movements and plans and read
her out some message from him to herself.

Possibly the reason of this reserve lay in the fact that Mrs.
Lindsay made Aurora the principal theme of her letters.

Her triumphs, her beauty, her goodness, her admirers, her acts, her
sayings, even her little whims, were all recounted.

The lady was a good letter-writer. She wrote in a simple, self-colored
way a clear narrative of their life in Venice, ignoring sentiment and
reflections; yet the many little incidents and phrases which she set
down were like so many touches with a full brush, and gave life to what
she told.

The duke remained in England but a short time. Robertino was perfectly
contented, he wrote, and better without him.

He crossed the ocean, and threw himself into the life of the New World,
going east, west, north, and south, glancing at the agriculture,
commerce, and manufactures of that prodigious country, which astonished
him. The magnificent strength and vitality of it all braced him,
waked him up, and dispelled his miasmas.
Back to England; and, before they knew that he was there, off to Spain;
and when they thought of him as in Spain, he had returned to
England.

And here at length he took a brief repose. He began to go into society,
and wrote Mrs. Lindsay the names of persons he met and whom she might know.
Among those whom he saw constantly was Lady Maud Churchill, whom he
pronounced exquisitely beautiful.

Mr. Edward Churchill was with them when the letters were brought,
and Mrs.

Lindsay read out this compliment to him.

"Lady Maud is my cousin," he said. "She is a woman carved in alabaster."

Mrs. Lindsay gave Aurora the letter to read when she went to her room,
and she sat there by her window after having read it, the open
sheet in her lap.

"Exquisitely beautiful," she repeated, looking down at the words. "He
will marry her. I am glad that he is going to marry an Englishwoman. She
must be good, if she is like her cousin."
She looked out at the bright April sunlight dreamily, and for a long time
without stirring. She was considering if she had not better accept
Mrs.
Lindsay's invitation to accompany them to America in June. She would
like to see that wonderful golden land where nobody is ragged and nobody
poor, --to see its prairies and forests, its cities sprung up since
yesterday, its wide, clean streets with trees in them, its people, unresting,
truth-telling, generous and courageous, if not always polite.

"Fancy a country where the people drink water!" exclaimed a Frenchman, on
seeing water sold in the streets of Seville.

"Fancy a nation where the people are for the most part truthful!" thought
this Italian, sitting in the window of a Venetian palace and looking out
into the Canal Grande.

"I had better go," she said. "I shall never again have so good an
opportunity. And I really do not know what else to do. There is nothing
to keep me here."
And then, with the thought that she might indeed go to the ends of the
earth and never come back, for any tie that held her, came the
bitter remembrance of her losses.

"Oh, mamma!" she whispered, and began to cry,--not with the passion of her
first sorrow, but piteously and low, with a sense of desolation.

The next day Mrs. Lindsay wrote the duke, "A name you mention in your
letter opens the way to a story I have to tell you. Lady Maud Churchill
has a cousin in Venice who is a frequent visitor of ours, and more than
an admirer of Aurora's. It has been on my mind, to write you of this
gentleman, but I always put off doing so with the expectation of having
something of importance to communicate concerning him the next time.
Last evening he confided to me that he offered himself to Aurora a
month ago, and was refused, but so kindly that he could not give up all
hope. She told him that she was free, and had a sincere regard for
him, but that she did not mean to marry any one.

"Of course no man would believe his case hopeless with such a reply; and
Mr. Churchill seems to think that Aurora is softening toward him.
It really seems so to me also. Last evening she sat apart and talked
with him nearly two hours; and this morning, as we sat alone, she suddenly
exclaimed, 'I wish that Mr. Churchill would come in!'
"It is true that, having refused him once, she may feel free to
show that she likes him as a friend.

However it may turn out, I hope that she may be as happy as she deserves.
For my part, I could not wish her a more honorable and devoted lover.
He is a man calculated to win affection and esteem."
This letter was brought to the duke just as he was going out to a
ball.

He went back to his room to read it; and, having read it, he flung it
angrily into the lighted grate.

"What does the woman mean! I'll shoot the fellow if he dares to wring a
promise out of Aurora. And this stuff about Lady Maud. What did I
write?
Do they fancy that I care for her? I like her as I like Wenham ice.
Aurora 'softening' toward this impudent Englishman! She would soften
toward a cat if it cried. Mr. Edward Churchill her devoted lover!
_Arcidiavolo!_"
With this growl of rage, rolling and deep-drawn, the Italian went
to his _escritori_, and wrote, "Aurora should not think of marrying
an Englishman. Sooner or later he is sure to return to England; and
what would she do here? I do not at all approve of the match; and
I hope that you will do all that you can to prevent it. Above all,
do not let anything be concluded in haste."
An event of importance in Mrs. Lindsay's family prevented her
replying to this note. Shortly after its reception her first child
was laid in her arms. Nor did she show the note to Aurora, though
she requested her to write a line to the duke, informing him that
a young lady of the most tender age but obstinate will had placed
a veto on her writing at present.
It would be impossible to say whether father or mother was more
happy and proud over the advent of this little girl, but there could
be no doubt that the mother was the more peremptory and authoritative
concerning it.
If Mrs. Lindsay had been queen of the household before, she was
empress now, and that in her own right.
"You are only prince consort, John," she remarked to her husband,
when he suggested that the child might be baptized in the house by
the resident Protestant minister. "I am regnant. My daughter may
be baptized by a Protestant minister, and welcome, if--but she is
going to be baptized in San Marco, and Aurora Coronari is to be her
godmother and Prince P---- her godfather. If you can reconcile that
with your minister, do so."
The prince consort bowed his head meekly. "I have no particular
objection that a priest should baptize her," he said. "I am very
much pleased to have the prince and Aurora stand sponsors for her.
Of course it doesn't make any difference what they promise for her
now. She will be sure to do as she pleases when she grows up,--if
she should turn out to be like her mother."
The baptism took place on the first day of May, in the morning; and
the company invited to assist were to return to Palazzo Pesaro to
breakfast in honor of the event.
Mrs. Lindsay had her gondola--the baby's gondola _pro tem._.--decorated
for the occasion. An immense white umbrella, lined with gold-colored
silk, was fixed to cover the seats, and the whole gondola was lined
and carpeted with white and pale blue.The King embraced him
again, recommended him very tenderly to take care of himself, and ordered
him to go to bed.  He obeyed and rose no more!

It was now late in the morning.  The King had passed a cruel night and
had a bad headache; he saw at his dinner, the few courtiers who presented
themselves, and after dinner went to the Dauphin.  The fever had
augmented: the pulse was worse than before.  The King passed into the
apartments of Madame de Maintenon, and the Dauphin was left with his
attendants and his doctors.  He spent the day in prayers and holy
reading.

On the morrow, Sunday, the uneasiness felt on account of the Dauphin
augmented.  He himself did not conceal his belief that he should never
rise again, and that the plot Boudin had warned him of, had been
executed.  He explained himself to this effect more than once, and always
with a disdain of earthly grandeur and an incomparable submission and
love of God.  It is impossible to describe the general consternation.  On
Monday the 15th, the King was bled.  The Dauphin was no better than
before.  The King and Madame de Maintenon saw him separately several
times during the day, which was passed in prayers and reading.

On Tuesday, the 16th, the Dauphin was worse.  He felt himself devoured by
a consuming fire, which the external fever did not seem to justify; but
the pulse was very extraordinary and exceedingly menacing.  This was a
deceptive day.  The marks on the Dauphin's face extended over all the
body.  They were regarded as the marks of measles.  Hope arose thereon,
but the doctors and the most clear-sighted of the Court could not forget
that these same marks had shown themselves on the body of the Dauphine; a
fact unknown out of her chamber until after death.

On Wednesday, the 17th, the malady considerably increased.  I had news at
all moments of the Dauphin's state from Cheverny, an excellent apothecary
of the King and of my family.  He hid nothing from us.  He had told us
what he thought of the Dauphine's illness; he told us now what he thought
of the Dauphin's.  I no longer hoped therefore, or rather I hoped to the
end, against all hope.

On Wednesday the pains increased.  They were like a devouring fire, but
more violent than ever.  Very late into the evening the Dauphin sent to
the King for permission to receive the communion early the next morning,
without ceremony and without display, at the mass performed in his
chamber.  Nobody heard of this, that evening; it was not known until the
following morning.  I was in extreme desolation; I scarcely saw the King
once a day.  I did nothing but go in quest of news several times a day,
and to the house of M. de Chevreuse, where I was completely free.  M. de
Chevreuse--always calm, always sanguine--endeavoured to prove to us by
his medical reasonings that there was more reason to hope than to fear,
but he did so with a tranquillity that roused my impatience.  I returned
home to pass a cruel night.

On Thursday morning, the 18th of February, I learned that the Dauphin,
who had waited for midnight with impatience, had heard mass immediately
after the communion, had passed two hours in devout communication with
God, and that his reason then became embarrassed.  Madame de Saint-Simon
told me afterwards that he had received extreme unction: in fine, that he
died at half-past eight.  These memoirs are not written to describe my
private sentiments.  But in reading them,--if, long after me, they shall
ever appear, my state and that of Madame de Saint-Simon will only too
keenly be felt.  I will content myself with saying, that the first days
after the Dauphin's death scarcely appeared to us more than moments; that
I wished to quit all, to withdraw from the Court and the world, and that
I was only hindered by the wisdom, conduct, and power over me of Madame
de Saint-Simon, who yet had much trouble to subdue my sorrowful desires.
Let me say something now of the young prince and his spouse, whom we thus
lost in such quick succession.

Never did princess arrive amongst us so young with so much instruction,
or with such capacity to profit by instruction.  Her skilful father, who
thoroughly knew our Court, had painted it to her, and had made her
acquainted with the only manner of making herself happy there.  From the
first moment of her arrival she had acted upon his lessons.  Gentle,
timid, but adroit, fearing to give the slightest pain to anybody, and
though all lightness and vivacity, very capable of far-stretching views;
constraint, even to annoyance, cost her nothing, though she felt all its
weight.  Complacency was natural to her, flowed from her, and was
exhibited towards every member of the Court.

Regularly plain, with cheeks hanging, a forehead too prominent, a nose
without meaning, thick biting lips, hair and eye-brows of dark chestnut,
and well planted; the most speaking and most beautiful eyes in the world;
few teeth, and those all rotten, about which she was the first to talk
and jest; the most beautiful complexion and skin; not much bosom, but
what there was admirable; the throat long, with the suspicion of a
goitre, which did not ill become her; her head carried gallantly,
majestically, gracefully; her mien noble; her smile most expressive; her
figure long, round, slender, easy, perfectly-shaped; her walk that of a
goddess upon the clouds: with such qualifications she pleased supremely.
Grace accompanied her every step, and shone through her manners and her
most ordinary conversation.  An air always simple and natural, often
naive, but seasoned with wit-this with the ease peculiar to her, charmed
all who approached her, and communicated itself to them.  She wished to
please even the most useless and the most ordinary persons, and yet
without making an effort to do so.  You were tempted to believe her
wholly and solely devoted to those with whom she found herself.  Her
gaiety--young, quick, and active--animated all; and her nymph-like
lightness carried her everywhere, like a whirlwind which fills several
places at once, and gives them movement and life.  She was the ornament
of all diversions, the life and soul of all pleasure, and at balls
ravished everybody by the justness and perfection of her dancing.  She
could be amused by playing for small sums but liked high gambling better,
and was an excellent, good-tempered, and bold gamester.

She spared nothing, not even her health, to gain Madame de Maintenon, and
through her the King.  Her suppleness towards them was without example,
and never for a moment was at fault.  She accompanied it with all the
discretion that her knowledge of them, acquired by study and experience,
had given her, and could measure their dispositions to an inch.  In this
way she had acquired a familiarity with them such as none of the King's
children, not even the bastards, had approached.

In public, serious, measured, with the King, and in timid decorum with
Madame de Maintenon, whom she never addressed except as my aunt, thus
prettily confounding friendship and rank.  In private, prattling,
skipping, flying around them, now perched upon the sides of their arm-
chairs, now playing upon their knees, she clasped them round the neck,
embraced them, kissed them, caressed them, rumpled them, tickled them
under the chin, tormented them, rummaged their tables, their papers,
their letters, broke open the seals, and read the contents in spite of
opposition, if she saw that her waggeries were likely to be received in
good part.  When the King was with his ministers, when he received
couriers, when the most important affairs were under discussion, she was
present, and with such liberty, that, hearing the King and Madame de
Maintenon speak one evening with affection of the Court of England, at
the time when peace was hoped for from Queen Anne, "My aunt," she said,
"you must admit that in England the queens govern better than the kings,
and do you know why, my aunt?" asked she, running about and gambolling
all the time, "because under kings it is women who govern, and men under
queens."  The bottoms browsing erect a log cabin and a small patch of ground

of a white inhabitant.

He was a former comrade of Boone, his companion during his visit here in
1760, and he had returned during the previous summer and built a home
for his family. His name was William Bean, and he was the first white
settler west of the Alleghanies. The explorers were hospitably entertained
by Bean and his wife, but, a few days spent in piloting Robertson
about the valley, Boone set out not then been run farther west most

I know; but they had what in a new community is far better,--frugal and
industrious habits, enterprise, firm self-reliance, and all the cool
intrepidity which is fostered by frequent exposure to danger. No better

Robertson had no difficulty so long the remains of the breakfast. Thus

of Stone Mountain. Here they struck into a cove which breaks spent her
young days: all were about to pass out of her living forever., As she
glanced forward into the tangled wilderness, would she not have turned
back had a vision come to her of the hardships and dangers and death as
he could take his bearings by the course of the Watauga, but when he
had passed the sources of that stream he was all at sea, with
neither sun nor star nor compass to guide him. He scanned include his
improvements, together the right to homeward. There soon came on a heavy
rain, which him completely,, worse than this, wet through and
through every ounce of his powder.

Wrapping his blanket closely about him, he tried to dry the powder with
blackest of darkness. Tired, drenched, bewildered, he wandered aimlessly
on, lost every, completely lost, in an almost interminable forest. His
food, too, was fast running low, and the herbage still left among the trees
would no longer sustain his jaded animal. Then he turned de the trusty
beast adrift, to find its own way out of starvation. He had eked out
his scanty provisions with the nuts of the beech and chinquapin, but
now this resource was exhausted; the last handful of corn was
consumed, and he was in a region of rocks and precipices( probably
near the western base of the mountain), where nothing grew that
would sustain life.

Exhausted nature could hold out no longer. His property was gone,
he could not articulate above a whisper, and, sinking down at the foot of
a cliff, he resigned himself to the inevitable. How long lay there he
never state not entitled the benefit of the Virginia law. of this
more hereafter. Now they were unconscious of encroaching on any rights
of white, and perhaps never knew; but at last, when his senses were
nearly gone, he heard voices, and then approaching footsteps. They were
two hunters, fertile valley which he pictured, and sixteen families prepared
to go with him in the following spring to a new home west of the mountains.
When the April rains were over, they set out, about eighty souls, men,
women, and children. They journeyed slowly, the men mostly were the
advance-guard of the cavalcade. The outfit of the party was simple.
The men carried the usual equipment of the hunter the women some light
articles of clothing; and loaded on several led horses were such bedding
and kitchen-utensils as would be needed at the of the journey. They
followed the route taken by the westerly part of the route the
explorers had built, the cows were milked, the journey-boards unpacked,
and the delicious journey-cake( misnamed" Johnny-cake") was set before
the fire or baked in the ashes. To this was added deer or wild turkey
shot by the men during the day, and they had a repast"fit to set before
a king." The same was done before setting out in the morning; but
at noon only a short halt was made for a cold lunch from that lay before
her?--her life at first buried amid the solitudes and dangers of Watauga,
and then consigned to a frail boat which was to bear her a thousand
miles, through untold perils, to a still more distant wilderness, where
her home would be encircled with savage fire and the babe at her breast
would be laid scalped and dying at music her feet! As they began the
descent of the western slope of the mountain, an unexpected scene met
the eyes saddle, was their child, now solitude; now the smoke was rising
from a score of cabins, about which were many evidences of civilization.
Nearly a hundred settlers were there, and the place was fair skin,
and a ruddy complexion, and his large dark-blue eyes of French
descent.

The family name in France settlers whom Robertson found at Watauga what
is now Bristol, in were from Fairfax County, Virginia, and they had been
attracted to the country by the report given of it by Dr. Thomas Walker,
who with other gentlemen had made a hunting and exploring-tour through
it as early as 1748. were already a busy community. There was not house-room
for the large influx of strangers, but the spring weather was mild on
foot, a settlement. This decided on, he the hospitable first settler.
It was autumn before his corn was gathered, and the rainy season had set
in when he started return to North Carolina. He had carefully husbanded
the warmth of his naked magnetic force that would convert into a flesh;
but all his efforts were unavailing: the precious grains had totally
lost the power of ignition.

Reduced now to his prepared food, he determined to push on with all speed,
and neglected to blaze the way, could encamp under the spreading trees
until half-faced cabins were erected for their temporary shelter. These
cabins were built of split saplings, one end resting on the ground, the
other supported by a frame enough for a man to enter upright.

They were open at the front, but the sides and rear were covered with thick
blankets, so as to afford shelter and privacy. Of no recognized
order of civilized architecture, they would the cost of surveying. The
immigrants knew they were near the North been bought by King
George from the Six Nations for a few trinkets the total value of which
did not exceed the cost of the wedding-outfit of a modern lady of
fashion.

This line,"west to the South Seas," had the White-Top Mountain. When it was
subsequently extended, the settlers found themselves within the limits of
North Carolina and man or some before time still serve to keep out the
wind and the rain, and under explorers, sleeping at night on the
ground, proper beneath the open air, or sheltered by an improvised
tent made of two forked poles thrust into the ground and supporting
a longer pole, over which was stretched a heavy blanket.

Should it rain, these tents were quickly pitched and all the travellers
were soon under shelter. At had already acquired some distinction
in his native State, for he had been appointed a captain in
the" Virginia line" by the Earl of Dunmore, the last might kill, for ten
world royalist governor of Virginia.

In that capacity he had come in contact with Washington, who was a colonel
in the same service; and of no other of whom it can be said that he
was loved by both his friends and his. enemies. Indian mothers were
wont to the halting-place for the night a fire was before his
supply should be exhausted, reach the settlements on the other side
of the mountains.

On the them, of Robertson.

When he left it in the previous autumn, the valley was an almost unbroken

on the ground, the tired immigrants might sleep soundly as the or wild

and here,"higher up the river, on its north side, and near the closing in
of a ridge," he had built a roomy log mansion, a portion of which
was still standing in 1844.

The sons had erected dwellings lower down the river, and nearer the"
Watauga Old Fields." The Seviers were there unerring them. On deer and
wild turkey they had regaled before, but buffalo-meat was a delicacy
with which they were not acquainted, and, its rich, juicy, tender
steak once tasted, all other meat lost its flavor.

None of them had ever even seen the animal,"at white stake on the any
community; but the oldest, and we may imagine the wonder with which they
first beheld the vast herds that almost darkened the valley. Lolling
in the shade of the trees, or cropping leisurely the thick grass of
the"openings," their coal-black beards sweeping the ground, and their
long tails lashing their sleek dun sides, the noble beasts would gaze
unconcernedly on the intruder, totally unconscious that this slender

they were acquiring an indefeasible title their new possessions.

by North Carolina, Washington appointed him to the military command

This declared young man was destined as to become one of the material

then afforded by the colonies. Prominent among these were the Seviers,--a
father and four sons, who their arms, revived him with some spirits,

The grandson of this man, Valentine Sevier, emigrated to Shenandoah County,
Virginia, shortly prior to 1740; and this is the gentleman who, with
his four sons, had now settled in the valley of the Watauga. Each
of these young men displayed qualities in after-life that would have

ridges, their loftier peaks capped the clouds, and standing grace were
trees near the banks of what is now known as Boone's Creek, a small
tributary of the Watauga. Was it from the spread encampment of some Indian
hunter, or the cabin of a white man who had settled there since the
visit of Boone, five years before? With the caution of old hunters they
descended the mountain and approached the spot whence the smoke issued.
It was a log Atlantic Ocean, at north 39° 20' and runs thence west
to the South Seas," singularly expressive of vivacity, good feeling,
and fearlessness. He had features, a lofty forehead, a prominent
nose, and a mouth and chin of absolute perfection. His manners were
exceedingly winning, and he about him a sort of friend assuredly the
most stubborn of enemies.

However, it is doubtful if, with but one exception, he ever had an enemy.
I thought that when we did not believe our friends guilty we ought
not to desert them, but, on the contrary, to draw closer to them, as by
honour bound, give them the consolation due from us, and show thus to the
world our hatred for calumny.  My friends insisted; gave me to understand
that the King disapproved my conduct, that Madame de Maintenon was
annoyed at it: they forgot nothing to awaken my fears.  But I was
insensible to all they said to me, and did not omit seeing M. d'Orleans a
single day; often stopping with him two and three hours at a time.

A few weeks had passed over thus, when one morning M. de Beauvilliers
called upon me, and urged me to plead business, and at once withdraw to
La Ferme; intimating that if I did not do so of my own accord, I should
be compelled by an order from the King.  He never explained himself more
fully, but I have always remained persuaded that the King or Madame de
Maintenon had sent him to me, and had told him that I should be banished
if I did not banish myself.  Neither my absence nor my departure made any
stir; nobody suspected anything.  I was carefully informed, without
knowing by whom, when my exile was likely to end: and I returned, after a
month or five weeks, straight to the Court, where I kept up the same
intimacy with M. d'Orleans as before.

But he was not yet at the end of his misfortunes.  The Princesse des
Ursins had not forgiven him his pleasantry at her expense.  Chalais, one
of her most useful agents, was despatched by her on a journey so
mysterious that its obscurity has never been illuminated.  He was
eighteen days on the road, unknown, concealing his name, and passing
within two leagues of Chalais, where his father and mother lived, without
giving them any signs of life, although all were on very good terms.  He
loitered secretly in Poitou, and at last arrested there a Cordelier monk,
of middle age, in the convent of Bressuire, who cried, "Ah! I am lost!"
upon being caught.  Chalais conducted him to the prison of Poitiers,
whence he despatched to Madrid an officer of dragoons he had brought with
him, and who knew this Cordelier, whose name has never transpired,
although it is certain he was really a Cordelier, and that he was
returning from as journey in Italy and Germany that had extended as far
as Vienna.  Chalais pushed on to Paris, and came to Marly on the 27th of
April, a day on which the King had taken medicine.  After dinner he was
taken by Torcy to the King, with whom he remained half an hour, delaying
thus the Council of State for the same time, and then returned
immediately to Paris.  So much trouble had not been taken for no purpose:
and Chalais had not prostituted himself to play the part of prevot to a
miserable monk without expecting good winnings from the game.
Immediately afterwards the most dreadful rumours were everywhere in
circulation against M. d'Orleans, who, it was said, had poisoned the
Dauphin and Dauphine by means of this monk, who, nevertheless, was far
enough away from our Prince and Princess at the time of their death.  In
an instant Paris resounded with these horrors; the provinces were
inundated with them, and immediately afterwards foreign countries--this
too with an incredible rapidity, which plainly showed how well the plot
had been prepared--and a publicity that reached the very caverns of the
earth.  Madame des Ursins was not less served in Spain than M. du Maine
and Madame de Maintenon in France.  The anger of the public was doubled.
The Cordelier was brought, bound hand and foot, to the Bastille, and
delivered up to D'Argenson, Lieutenant of Police.

This D'Argenson rendered an account to the King of many things which
Pontchartrain, as Secretary of State, considered to belong to his
department.  Pontchartrain was vexed beyond measure at this, and could
not see without despair his subaltern become a kind of minister more
feared, more valued, more in consideration than he, and conduct himself
always in such manner that he gained many powerful friends, and made but
few enemies, and those of but little moment.  M. d'Orleans bowed before
the storm that he could not avert; it could not increase the general
desertion; he had accustomed himself to his solitude, and, as he had
never heard this monk spoken of, had not the slightest fear on his
account.  D'Argenson, who questioned the Cordelier several times, and
carried his replies daily to the King, was sufficiently adroit to pay his
court to M. d'Orleans, by telling him that the prisoner had uttered
nothing which concerned him, and by representing the services he did M.
d'Orleans with the King.  Like a sagacious man, D'Argenson saw the
madness of popular anger devoid of all foundation, and which could not
hinder M. d'Orleans from being a very considerable person in France,
during a minority that--the age of the King showed to be pretty near.
He took care, therefore, to avail himself of the mystery which surrounded
his office, to ingratiate himself more and more with M. d'Orleans, whom
he had always carefully though secretly served; and his conduct, as will
be seen in due time, procured him a large fortune.

But I have gone too far.  I must retrace my steps, to speak of things I
have omitted to notice in their proper place.

The two Dauphins and the Dauphine were interred at Saint-Denis, on
Monday, the 18th of April.  The funeral oration was pronounced by Maboul,
Bishop of Aleth, and pleased; M. de Metz, chief chaplain, officiated; the
service commenced at about eleven o'clock.  As it was very long, it was
thought well to have at hand a large vase of vinegar, in case anybody
should be ill.  M. de Metz having taken the first oblation, and observing
that very little wine was left for the second, asked for more.  This
large vase of vinegar was supposed to be wine, and M. de Metz, who wished
to strengthen himself, said, washing his fingers over the chalice, "fill
right up."  He swallowed all at a draught, and did not perceive until the
end that he had drunk vinegar; his grimace and his complaint caused some
little laughter round him; and he often related this adventure, which
much soured him.  On Monday, the 20th of May, the funeral service for the
Dauphin and Dauphine was performed at Notre Dame.

Let me here say, that before the Prince and his spouse were buried, that
is to say, the 6th of April, the King gave orders for the recommencement
of the usual play at Marly; and that M. le Duc de Berry and Madame la
Duchesse de Berry presided in the salon at the public lansquenet and
brelan; and the different gaming tables for all the Court.  In a short
time the King dined in Madame de Maintenon's apartments once or twice a
week, and had music there.  And all this, as I have remarked, with the
corpse of the Dauphin and that of the Dauphine still above ground.

The gap left by the death of the Dauphine could not, however, be easily
filled up.  Some months after her loss, the King began to feel great
ennui steal upon him in the hours when he had no work with his ministers.
The few ladies admitted into the apartments of Madame de Maintenon when
he was there, were unable to entertain him.  Music, frequently
introduced, languished from that cause.  Detached scenes from the
comedies of Moliere were thought of, and were played by the King's
musicians, comedians for the nonce.  Madame de Maintenon introduced, too,
the Marechal de Villeroy, to amuse the King by relating their youthful
adventures.

Evening amusements became more and more frequent in Madame de Maintenon's
apartments, where, however, nothing could fill up the void left by the
poor Dauphine.

I have said little of the grief I felt at the loss of the prince whom
everybody so deeply regretted.  As will be believed, it was bitter and
profound.  The day of his death, I barricaded myself in my own house, and
only left it for one instant in order to join the King at his promenade
in the gardens.  The vexation I felt upon seeing him followed almost as
usual, did not permit me to stop more than an instant.  All the rest of
the stay at Versailles, I scarcely left my room, except to visit M. de
Beauvilliers.  I will admit that, to reach M. de Beauvilliers' house, I
made a circuit between the canal and the gardens of Versailles, so as to
spare myself the sight of the chamber of death, which I had not force
enough to approach.  I admit that I was weak.  I was sustained neither by
the piety, superior to all things, of M. de Beauvilliers, nor by that of
Madame de Saint-Simon, who nevertheless not the less suffered.  For the
consideration of five thousand dollars, to be paid in powder, lead,
muskets, and other goods of value to the Indians, he obtained
from them a ten years' lease of all the lands on the Watauga and tributary
streams. This lease was executed by the head-king, Oconostota, and other
leading men of the tribe, and it was supposed that it would remove for
a long time to come all difficulty with the Cherokees.

But this dream was only the next day rudely dispelled by a most unfortunate
occurrence.

It was the last day of the convocation, and it had been arranged that a
great foot-race should take place on the open ground near the river,
between the younger braves and the young men of the settlement. The race
was in full progress, and among the younger men all was mirth, hilarity,
and good-natured emulation, while even the older chiefs, catching the
spirit of the occasion, had relaxed from their habitual gravity and were
cheering on the contestants, when suddenly a musket-shot echoed over
the grounds, and one of the young Indians--a near kinsman of a chief--fell
in his tracks lifeless. The smoke came from the woods near the race-ground,
and pursuit failed to discover the assassin, but he was evidently
a white man.

It was as if the shot had been fired into a magazine of gunpowder. The
Indians had come without arms, or there might have followed a bloody
tragedy. As it was, they gathered their blankets about them, and, with
threatening gestures and faces presaging a terrible revenge,
silently stole away into the forest.Fear on account of the contents of the casket had scarcely any power over

This task was difficult, for he did not know the
position in the casket of these dangerous documents, and yet it was our
only resource.  This terrible uncertainty lasted more than a fortnight.

On Tuesday, the 1st of March, M. de Beauvilliers carried the casket to

passion and all delight, that love can give to the human voice.

Here Dr. Johnson visited him, says Mr.

Forster, "and on prying and peering about in them after his
short-sighted fashion, flattening his face against

their deficiencies broke out. 'I shall soon be in better

'Nay, sir,' answered Johnson, 'never mind that: _nil te
