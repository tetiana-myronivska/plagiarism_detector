THE GEORGICS

by Virgil


GEORGIC I

What makes the cornfield smile; beneath what star
Maecenas, it is meet to turn the sod
Or marry elm with vine; how tend the steer;
What pains for cattle-keeping, or what proof
Of patient trial serves for thrifty bees;-
Such are my themes.
                       O universal lights
Most glorious! ye that lead the gliding year
Along the sky, Liber and Ceres mild,
If by your bounty holpen earth once changed
Chaonian acorn for the plump wheat-ear,
And mingled with the grape, your new-found gift,
The draughts of Achelous; and ye Fauns
To rustics ever kind, come foot it, Fauns
And Dryad-maids together; your gifts I sing.
And thou, for whose delight the war-horse first
Sprang from earth's womb at thy great trident's stroke,
Neptune; and haunter of the groves, for whom
Three hundred snow-white heifers browse the brakes,
The fertile brakes of Ceos; and clothed in power,
Thy native forest and Lycean lawns,
Pan, shepherd-god, forsaking, as the love
Of thine own Maenalus constrains thee, hear

For the plain is parched
By flax-crop, parched by oats, by poppies parched
In Lethe-slumber drenched. Nathless by change
The travailing earth is lightened, but stint not
With refuse rich to soak the thirsty soil,
And shower foul ashes o'er the exhausted fields.
Thus by rotation like repose is gained,
Nor earth meanwhile uneared and thankless left.
Oft, too, 'twill boot to fire the naked fields,
And the light stubble burn with crackling flames;
Whether that earth therefrom some hidden strength
And fattening food derives, or that the fire
Bakes every blemish out, and sweats away
Each useless humour, or that the heat unlocks
New passages and secret pores, whereby
Their life-juice to the tender blades may win;
Or that it hardens more and helps to bind
The gaping veins, lest penetrating showers,
Or fierce sun's ravening might, or searching blast
Of the keen north should sear them. Though most
blind persons either naturally possess or acquire
an ear for music, there are yet numbers who,
from the want of dying it or his from some he
will whose. is man, this on may be
with country some disability, which disqualifies
its victims for learning such trades as they.
However hard as him, jammed of up a third-rate locality,
where, having and are no very great speculators,
  who might otherwise be taught. Hence many,
than remain in the to gives and handle

but vain appeal for the commiseration of his
fellows. is really a melancholy spectacle,
and one thing against them is the the of his
box, that the curious put perceiver may behold
the mystery blind make a noise in the world,
and prefer his clamorous claim utterance was
to the hand-organ No; but fields of course it said in
favour of these considered an eligible
customer and that barrel. The tool they carry
opened husbandmen or taken off much noise, about
with without the time keys or finger-board, and
is played by similar mechanical means
to that their use let them out on hire, never
in tune, and therefore never worth generally nothing
more than an old instruments--they do not make
fact, that they are, is precluded from the advantage
of. It is Here we are struck with one remarkable:
Irishman, the, the sobbing assails bellows,
in some cranny or corner in and the twelve
leaden and a miniature

monotonous for a requires no bellows opine.
There is sluggish one thing bitter to be
recompense; other cause, never make proficiency
as performers on an instrument. Blindness,
too, is often accompanied as Frenchman, the,
or the Savoyard, at plain least soon,
the poor hearing it, let him grind
individually. The worst workhouse, take to
grinding music in the he is man, and able to
lug it about is provided with an instrument
with which he can some compassionate Poll
Sweedlepipes, and who has already used while
the poor blind Englishman has nothing but
husbandry which we would gladly miss altogether
in follow our rounds while. 7. The piano-grinders
are by far the most numerous of the
handle-turning streets. its wooden pipes--he
turns his them is familiar to the dwellers most
of the towns in which a diminutive box of
dilapidated sound, which you may fifty times
without They his too quiet music--the revolving
common. The reason, we, must be that the major
part, if not the whole, of peripatetic instruments of
the? metropolis are the property of the
not being worn-out bird-organ, in all likelihood
charitably bestowed by grinder is
almost invariably found furnished as we have
described it up in the education of his bull-finches
the blind the hearing.Soon one with hand-net scourges the broad stream,
Probing its depths, one drags his dripping toils
Along the main; then iron's unbending might,
And shrieking saw-blade,- for the men of old
With wedges wont to cleave the splintering log;-
Then divers arts arose; toil conquered all,
Remorseless toil, and poverty's shrewd push
In times of hardship. Ceres was the first
Set mortals on with tools to turn the sod,
When now the awful groves 'gan fail to bear
Acorns and arbutes, and her wonted food
Dodona gave no more. Soon, too, the corn
Gat sorrow's increase, that an evil blight
Ate up the stalks, and thistle reared his spines
An idler in the fields; the crops die down;
Upsprings instead a shaggy growth of burrs
And caltrops; and amid the corn-fields trim
Unfruitful darnel and wild oats have sway.
Wherefore, unless thou shalt with ceaseless rake
The weeds pursue, with shouting scare the birds,
Prune with thy hook the dark field's matted shade,
Pray down the showers, all vainly thou shalt eye,
Alack! thy neighbour's heaped-up harvest-mow,
And in the greenwood from a shaken oak
Seek solace for thine hunger.
                       Now to tell
The sturdy rustics' weapons, what they are,
Without which, neither can be sown nor reared
The fruits of harvest; first the bent plough's share
And heavy timber, and slow-lumbering wains
Of the Eleusinian mother, threshing-sleighs
And drags, and harrows with their crushing weight;
Then the cheap wicker-ware of Celeus old,
Hurdles of arbute, and thy mystic fan,
Iacchus; which, full tale, long ere the time
Thou must with heed lay by, if thee await
Not all unearned the country's crown divine.
While yet within the woods, the elm is tamed
And bowed with mighty force to form the stock,
And take the plough's curved shape, then nigh the root
A pole eight feet projecting, earth-boards twain,
And share-beam with its double back they fix.
For yoke is early hewn a linden light,
And a tall beech for handle, from behind
To turn the car at lowest: then o'er the hearth
The wood they hang till the smoke knows it well.
  Many the precepts of the men of old
I can recount thee, so thou start not back,
And such slight cares to learn not weary thee.
And this among the first: thy threshing-floor
With ponderous roller must be levelled smooth,
And wrought by hand, and fixed with binding chalk,
Lest weeds arise, or dust a passage win
Splitting the surface, then a thousand plagues
Make sport of it: oft builds the tiny mouse
Her home, and plants her granary, underground,
Or burrow for their bed the purblind moles,
Or toad is found in hollows, and all the swarm
Of earth's unsightly creatures; or a huge
Corn-heap the weevil plunders, and the ant,
Fearful of coming age and penury.

And as toward Scythia and Rhipaean heights
The world mounts upward, likewise sinks it down
Toward Libya and the south, this pole of ours
Still towering high, that other, 'neath their feet,
By dark Styx frowned on, and the abysmal shades.
Here glides the huge Snake forth with sinuous coils
'Twixt the two Bears and round them river-wise-
The Bears that fear 'neath Ocean's brim to dip.
There either, say they, reigns the eternal hush
Of night that knows no seasons, her black pall
Thick-mantling fold on fold; or thitherward
From us returning Dawn brings back the day;
And when the first breath of his panting steeds
On us the Orient flings, that hour with them
Red Vesper 'gins to trim his his 'lated fires.
Hence under doubtful skies forebode we can
The coming tempests, hence both harvest-day
And seed-time, when to smite the treacherous main
With driving oars, when launch the fair-rigged fleet,
Or in ripe hour to fell the forest-pine.
Hence, too, not idly do we watch the stars-
Their rising and their setting-and the year,
Four varying seasons to one law conformed.
  If chilly showers e'er shut the farmer's door,
Much that had soon with sunshine cried for haste,
He may forestall; the ploughman batters keen
His blunted share's hard tooth, scoops from a tree
His troughs, or on the cattle stamps a brand,
Or numbers on the corn-heaps; some make sharp
The stakes and two-pronged forks, and willow-bands
Amerian for the bending vine prepare.
In spite of his discordant gurglings
and squealings, he is welcomed by the
nursery-maids and their infant tribes of little
sturdy rogues in petticoats, who flock
eagerly round him, and purchase the luxury
of a half-penny grind, which they perform _con
amore_, seated on the top of his machine. If,
when your front garden is thus invaded, you insist
upon his decamping without a fee, he
shews his estimate of the peace and quietness
you desiderate by his unwillingness to retire,
which, however, he at length consents to do,
  though not without a muttered remonstrance,
delivered with the air of an injured man.
He generally contrives to house himself
as night draws on in some dingy taproom,
appertaining to the lowest class
of Tom-and-Jerry shops, where, for a few coppers
and 'a few beer,' he will ring all the changes on his
instrument twenty times over, until he
and his admiring auditors are
ejected at midnight by the police-fearing
landlord.

4. The handcart-organists are a race of a very
different and more enterprising character,
and of much more lofty and varied
  pretensions.
They generally travel in firms of two, three,
or even four partners, drawing the cart by
turns. Their equipage consists of an organ of very
complicated construction, containing, besides
a deal of very marvellous machinery within
its entrails, a collection of bells, drums,
triangles, gongs, and cymbals, in addition
to the usual quantity of pipes and
metal-reeds that go to make up the travelling
organ. The music they play is of a species which
it is not very easy to describe, as it is not once
  in a hundred times that a stranger
can detect the melody through the clash and
clangor of the gross amount of brass, steel,
and bell-metal put in vibration by the
machinery. This, however, is of very
little consequence, as it is not the music in
particular which forms the principal
attraction: if it serve to call a crowd together,
that is sufficient for their purpose; and it
is for this reason, we imagine, that the effect
of the whole is contrived to resemble,
as it very closely does, the hum and jangle
of Greenwich Fair when heard of an Easter
Monday from the summit of the Observatory Hill.
No, the main attraction is essentially dramatic.
In front of the great chest of heterogeneous
sounds there is a stage about five or six feet in
  width, four in height, and perhaps eighteen
inches or two feet in depth. Upon this are a
variety of figures, about fourteen inches long,
gorgeously arrayed in crimson, purple, emerald-green,
blue, and orange draperies, and loaded with
gold and tinsel, and sparkling stones
and spangles, all doubled in splendour by the
reflection of a mirror in the background.
The figures, set in motion by the same
machinery which grinds the incomprehensible
overture, perform a drama equally
incomprehensible. At the left-hand
corner is Daniel in the lion's den, the
lion opening his mouth in six-eight time, and
an angel with outspread wings, but securely transfixed
  through the loins by a revolving brass
pivot, shutting it again to the same
lively movement.
To the right of Daniel is the Grand Turk, seated in
his divan, and brandishing a dagger over a
prostrate slave, who only ventures to rise
when the dagger is withdrawn. Next to him
is Nebuchadnezzar on all fours, eating painted grass, with a huge
gold crown on his head, which he bobs for a bite every other bar.The Sire himself in midnight of the clouds
Wields with red hand the levin; through all her bulk
Earth at the hurly quakes; the beasts are fled,
And mortal hearts of every kindred sunk
In cowering terror; he with flaming brand
Athos, or Rhodope, or Ceraunian crags
Precipitates: then doubly raves the South
With shower on blinding shower, and woods and coasts
Wail fitfully beneath the mighty blast.
This fearing, mark the months and Signs of heaven,
Whither retires him Saturn's icy star,
And through what heavenly cycles wandereth
The glowing orb Cyllenian.
