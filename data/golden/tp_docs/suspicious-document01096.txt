actress.


CHAPTER III

AT THE RED MILL


Helen, greatly excited, stood on the seat of the tonneau and cheered her
brother on at the top of her voice. That, in her excitement, she thought
she was "rooting" at a basket-ball game at Briarwood, was not to be
wondered at. Ruth heard her chum screaming:

    "S.B.--Ah-h-h!
     S.B.--Ah-h-h
     Sound our battle-cry
     Near and far!
     S.B.--All!
     Briarwood Hall!
     Sweetbriars, do or die----
     This be our battle-cry----
     Briarwood Hall!
     _That's All!_"

At the very moment the excited Helen brought out the "snapper" of the
rallying cry of their own particular Briarwood sorority, Ruth let the limb
go, for Tom had seized the sinking actress by the shoulder.

"He's got her!" the men shouted in chorus.

"And that's all those fellows were," Ruth said afterwards, in some
contempt. "Just a _chorus_! They were a lot of tabby-cats--afraid to wet
their precious feet. If it hadn't been for Tom, Miss Gray would have been
drowned before the eyes of that mean director and those other imitation
men. Ugh! I de-_test_ a coward!"

This was said later, however. Until they drew Tom and his fainting burden
ashore, neither Ruth nor Helen had time for criticism. He must know that
you take no interest in him or his story. Even if you did, his manner
of telling it would flatten you, yet he fascinates you with that
glassy stare, that self-conscious and self-admiring smirk, and
distils his tale into your ears at the very moment when you are
burning to talk over old College-days with CHALMERS, or to discuss
an article in the _Field_ with SHABRACK.

I remember once finding myself, by some freak of mocking destiny,
in a house in which _two_ bores had established fortified camps.

On the first night, we all became so dazed with intolerable dulness, that
our powers of resistance faded away to the vanishing point. Both bores
sallied out from their ramparts, laid our little possessions waste,
and led, each his tale of captives back with him, gagged, bound,
and incapable of struggle.

So next day, when the accustomed train Of things grew round our
sense again,
we agreed together, those of us, I mean, who had suffered on the
previous night, that something must be done.

What it was to be we could not at first decide. We should have preferred
"something lingering, with boiling oil in it," but at last we decided on
the brilliant suggestion of SHABRACK, who was of the party, that
we should endeavour by some means or other to bring the two bores,
as it were, face to face in a kind of boring-competition in the
smoking-room that very night, to engage them in warfare against one
another and ourselves to sit by and watch them mutually extinguishing
one another; a result that, we were certain, could not fail to be
brought about, owing to the deadly nature of the weapons with which
each was provided.

Both the bores, I may observe, shot execrably during the day. In the evening,
after a short preliminary skirmish, from which SHABRACK the hussar
extricated us with but little loss, that which we desired came to
pass.

It was a terrible spectacle. In a moment both these magnificent animals,
their bristles erect, and all their tusks flashing fiercely in the
lamp-light, were locked in the death-grapple.
Every detail of the memorable struggle is indelibly burnt into my
brain.

Even at this distance of time, I can remember how we all looked on, silent,
awestruck, fascinated, as the dreadful fight proceeded to its
inevitable close.

For the benefit of others, let me attempt to describe it in the appropriate
language of the Ring.

GREAT FIGHT BETWEEN THE KENTISH PROSER AND THE HAMPSHIRE DULLARD.

_Round I._--Both men advanced, confident, but cautious.

After sparring for an opening, the Proser landed lightly on the jaw with,--"When
the Duke of DASHBURY did me the honour to ask me to his Grace's
noble deer-forest."

He ducked to avoid the return, but the Hampshire Champion would not be
denied, and placed two heavy fish-stories fair in the bread-basket.
The Proser swung round a vicious right-hander anecdote about a
stag shot at 250 yards, but the blow fell short, and he was fairly
staggered by two in succession ("the tree-climbing rabbit," and
"the Marquis of DULLFIELD'S gaiters"), delivered straight on the
mouth.

First blood for the Dullard.

After some hard exchanges they closed, and fell, the Dullard
underneath.

_Round II._--Both blowing a good deal. The Proser put up his Dukes, and
let fly with both of them, one after another, at the Dullard's
conk, drawing claret profusely.

Nothing daunted, the Dullard watched his opportunity, and delivered
a first-class Royal Prince on the Proser's right eye, half closing
that optic.

The men now closed, but broke away again almost directly. Some smart
fibbing, in which neither could claim an advantage, ensued. The round was
brought to a close by some rapid exchanges, after which the Proser went
down. Betting 6 to 4 on the Dullard.

_Round III., and last.

_--Proser's right peeper badly swollen, the Dullard gory, and a bit
groggy, but still smiling. Proser opened with a ricochet, which did
great execution, but was countered heavily when he attempted to repeat
the trick, the Dullard all but knocking him off his legs with a fifty-pound
salmon. After some slight exchanges they began a hammer-and-tongs game,
in which Proser scored heavily.
Dullard, however, pulled himself together for a final rush.

They met in the middle of the ring, and both fell heavily. As neither was
able to rise, the fight was drawn. Both men were heavily damaged, and
were carried away with their jaws broken.

There you have the story. The actual result was that these two ponderous
bores all but did one another to death.

So exhausted were they by the terrible conflict, that our comfort was not
again disturbed by them during this particular visit. We were lucky,
though at first we scarcely saw it, in getting two evenly matched
ironclad bores together.

If we had had only one, the matter would have been far more difficult.

THE COMPLIMENT OF COIN.

(_AN EXTRACT FROM MR. PUNCH'S PURELY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS._)
SCENE--_Interior of a Palace._ Emperor _and_ Empress _discovered discussing
the former's tour in foreign parts._
_Emperor_ (_finishing a good story_). So after I had made a hearty meal
off the bread-and-milk, I gave the old woman a note for five
thousand thalers, and told her to buy a three-sous portrait of
myself so that she might see the Sovereign that she had saved from
starvation.

Ha! ha! ha! Wasn't it amusing?

_Empress_ (_smiling_). Very, dear; but wasn't it a little expensive?
Surely you could have got the bread-and-milk for a smaller sum?

_Emperor._ Of course I could! But then, don't you see, it made me popular.
It's in all the papers, and reads splendidly!

_Empress._ Yes, of course, dear.

By the way, I found this volume (_producing book bound in velvet with real
gold clasps_) in your overcoat. May I peep into it?

_Emperor_ (_doubtfully_). I don't think you will find it particularly
interesting.

I have just jotted down my petty cash disbursements.

_Empress_ (_opening book and glancing at contents_).

Dear me! Why the total amounts to £15,000! I see it's put in English
money.

_Emperor._ Yes, it saves trouble.

When I am travelling I get rather confused with all coinage save that of
Mother's Fatherland.

_Empress._ But surely £15,000 is a lot to expend upon extras?

_Emperor._ Depends on the view you take of things.

I had a lot of things to buy.

_Empress._ But surely _this_ must be wrong? Shoeblack fifty guineas!

_Emperor_ (_lightly_). No, I think that's all right. You see, the
fellow, after he had cleaned my boots, suddenly recognised me,
called me Sire, and sang the "_Wacht am Rhein_."

I couldn't, after that, give him less.

_Empress._ Well, you know best, dear; but I should have thought you
could have got your boots cleaned for rather less!

_Emperor._ Possibly; but I should have lost the story. And you know it reads
so well.

_Empress._ And here's another rather big item. £800 for a London cabman!

_Emperor._ I consider _that_ the cheapest item in the lot. He wanted
more!

_Empress._ And here are several items of seventy pounds apiece. What were
_they_ for?

_Emperor._ Oh, nothing in particular. Little girl picked up my handkerchief,
and a little boy asked me for a kite. Was obliged to give them each a bundle
of tenners. It would have been so mean if I had given them less. But
there, I told you you wouldn't find the book at all interesting.

If you will pass it to me, I will lock it up.

_Empress._ Oh, certainly, dear. (_Gives up volume._) And now, darling, I am
going to ask you a favour. You never saw such a pet of a coronet as
they have at Von ----'s.

Now I want you to buy it for me particularly.

_Emperor_ (_embarrassed_). Certainly, dear--but you know, we are not too
well off.

_Empress._ Oh, but it is simply charming. Rubies round the edge, and a cross
of brilliants and emeralds. And, really, _so_ cheap.

They only want £100,000 for it!

_Emperor._ Very nice indeed; but just at this moment it would be a little
inconvenient to produce so large a sum.

_Empress._ Large sum! Why, the rubies alone are worth all the
money.

_Emperor._ Yes, I know, dear. And now I must hurry away; duty, my love,
comes before pleasure. See you soon.

* * * * *
AN EVENING FROM HOME.

There used to appear daily--and it may be appearing daily now, for
aught I know, only, speaking on oath, I haven't lately noticed it--a
question addressed by Everybody in General, or by Nobody in
Particular to Everybody Else, which took this form: "Where shall
we dine to-day?"

I forget what the answer was, but, as a rule, the domesticated man,
with a good cook in his own kitchen, could answer it offhand by
saying to himself, "'_Where_ shall we dine to-day?'

Why, at home, of course--where better?

--and catch me moving out afterwards." But, if he were contemplating the
unpleasant certainty of having post-prandially to leave his hearth and home
in order to visit some theatre, opera, or concert, then it might
occur to him that he could do the thing well, and give his party a
novel treat, if, in French fashion, he took them somewhere to dine,
previous to doing their play.

Thus it occurred to Yours truly, Y TI-BULLUS BIBULUS, a day or two ago,
when, dressed in his classical evening Togaryii in a _Currus
Pulcher_ (with a _Cursor_ alongside anticipating _denarii_, and
risking the sharp rebuke of a probable _Cursor_ inside the vehicle)
he was passing the Oxford Music Hall, and a brightly decorated
Restauration caught his observant eye.

Was it new, or was it a Restauration restored? Its name, in large
letters, "FRASCATI."

This seemed at once to lend itself to a familiar jingle, and I found
myself humming,-- 
Oh, did you never hear of Frascati?

'Tis not far from Rome, eh my hearty?
The place looks so fine, I will there go and dine, And I'll bring with me
all of my party!

[Illustration: "Our Hamp-phitryon."]
Horatian inspiration! I like to find out a new dining-place. Years
ago, by the merest accident sailing north, I discovered the Holborn, and,
since then, how many have not blessed the Columbus Holbornius?

I do not ask how many _have_ done so. "That is another story." Since then,
the taste for dining domestically away from home has come considerably into
fashion.

The Ladies like it, and the Law allows it.
(Quotation from _Merchant of Venice_ adapted to occasion--Restaurant
edition--_Portia_ for two.)

It is a cheerful change, it assists the circulation of coin, it is an aid
to the solution of the problems of Bimetallism, it rejuvenesces the
home-fire-sider, it developes ideas, restores the balance of temper; and,
if only the dinner be good, everybody goes away delighted,--guests
are satisfied, the host is pleased, the waiter smiles on the tipper,
the tipper on the manager, the manager on the proprietor, and all
is Joy and Junketing!

Judge my surprise, when to me, TIBULLUS, entering Frascati, and as
_Cicerone_, informing my friends (all eager and hungry, and therefore
unwilling to dispute) how Frascati was the ancient Tusculum, a
well-known face appears welcoming us with smiles.

It is Signor HAMPI, better known as Mr. HAMP of Holborn. "Salve!" quoth I,
as TIBULLUS. "The same to you, Sir," responds HAMPIUS. "Now," said my
friend WAGSTAFFIUS, without whom no party is complete, "Now we
shall be Hamp-ly satisfied."

The arrangement of the Frascati is a novelty; it is all so open and,
though there are plenty of staffers about, not in the least stuffy.

It would take a considerable crowd to overcrowd the place and to
demoralise the troops of well-disciplined waiters, all under the eye of
the ever-vigilant generalissimo of the forces, who in his white
waist-coat, black tie, and frock-coat of most decided cut and
uncompromising character--there is much in a frock-coat and something
too in the wearing of it--is here, there, and everywhere, and only
waiting till the last moment, and the right one, when the banquet
is ended, to give the word of command, "Charge!"

--and the charge (decidedly moderate and previously named in the _carte
du jour_) is received with satisfaction and defrayed with delight.

I have only one suggestion to make, and that affects the music not the meal.
Let the music be adapted to the dishes; and not only should the course
of time be considered as it progresses, but also the time of the course.
For example,--who that has an ear for music can swallow oysters
deliberately and sedately while the band is playing a mad galop?

Let there be something very slow and _pianissimo_ for the _hors d'oeuvres_:
something gentle and soothing for the oysters; there can be an
indication of heartiness in the melody that ushers in the soup, as
though giving it a warm welcome. There should be a mincing minuet-like
movement for the _entrées_, a sparkling air for the champagne, and something
robust for the joint. A sporting tune for the game: sweet melody for the
sweets, and a grand and grateful Chorale--a kind of thanksgiving
service as it were--when the last crumb and the last bit of cheese
have been swept away.

[Illustration: "Up I came with my little lot!!"]
After this to The Pavilion, in plenty of time to hear the ubiquitous
ALBERT CHEVALIER singing his celebrated coster-songs.

Signor COSTA was a well-known name in the musical world some years ago;
CHEVALIER Coster is about the best-known now. These ditties are uncommonly
telling; the music is so catching and so really good. Then his singing of
the little Nipper "on'y so 'igh, that's all," has in it that touch
of nature which makes you drop the silent tear and pretend you are
blowing your nose.

Capital entertainment at the "Pav." Ingress and egress is not
difficult, and the place doesn't become inconveniently hot. The sweet
singer with the poetic name of HERBERT CAMPBELL is very funny;
which indeed he would be, even if he never opened his mouth.

Such a low comedian's "mug!"
But of all the pretty things to be seen in its perfection here (I
have seen it elsewhere, and was not so struck by it) is the Skirt
Dance.

It is "real elegant," graceful, and picturesque. What a change has come
over the Music-hall entertainment since--since--"since even _I_ was a boy!"
says the Acting Manager, Mr. EDWARD SWANBOROUGH,--evergreen in the true
sense of the word. A vast improvement, no doubt of it.

But, with such good amusement for the public, why on earth do the Music-Halls
want to do "Dramatic Sketches"?

And, if they do them, then, judging by what I saw at the "Pav," I am fain
to ask again, why, in the name of SHAKSPEARE, and the musical
glasses, should the theatres object?

Does anyone seriously think that _Othello_ or _King Lear_ is wanted at
the Music-Halls, or that SHERIDAN'S _School for Scandal_ wouldn't
empty any Music-Hall of its patrons?

It is the "variety" which is the charm of the Music-hall show, and if any
one part of the variety show is a bit too long--longer let us say, than
the time it takes to smoke one-eighth of a fair-sized cigar and to drink
half a glass of something according to taste--then the audience
will pretty plainly express what _they_ understand by Variety, what
_they_ have paid to see, and what they mean to have for their money;
and if they don't get it there, they'll go somewhere else where it
will be given them.

    The summing-up, Gentlemen, is that,
      if you want a pleasant evening, you can't do better than dine at
Frascati and afterwards patronise the "Pav."

Such is the opinion of

Y TI-BULLUS BIB
"Sometimes I feel
like I was a burden on him myself."

"_You_ a burden, dear Aunt Alvirah!" cried Ruth, with tears in her eyes.
"You would be a blessing, not a burden, in anybody's house. Uncle Jabez
was very fortunate indeed to get you to come here to the Red Mill."

"I dunno--I dunno," groaned the old lady. "Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!
I'm a poor, rheumaticky creeter--and nobody but Jabez would have taken me
out o' the poorhouse an' done for me as he has."

"You mean, you have done for him!" cried Ruth, in some passion. "You have
kept his house for him, and mended for him, and made a home for him, for
years. And I doubt if he has ever thanked you--not _once_!"

"But I have thanked him, deary," said Aunt Alvirah, sweetly. "And I do
thank him, same as I do our Father in Heaven, ev'ry day of my life, for
takin' me away from that poorfarm an' makin' an independent woman of me
a'gin. Oh, Jabez ain't all bad. Fur from it, my pretty--fur from it!

"Now that you ain't no more beholden to him for your eddication, an' all,
he is more pennyurious than ever--yes he is! For Jabez's sake, I could
almost wish you hadn't got all that money you did, for gittin' back the
lady's necklace. Spendin' money breeds the itch for spendin' more. Since
you wrote him that you was goin' to pay all your school bills, Jabez
Potter is cured of the little itch of _that_ kind he ever had."

"Oh, Aunt Alvirah! Think of me--I am glad to be independent, too."

"I know--I know," admitted Aunt Alvirah. "But it's hard on Jabez. He was
givin' you the best eddication he could----"

"Grumblingly enough, I am sure!" interposed Ruth, with a pout. She could
speak plainly to the little old woman, for Aunt Alvirah _knew_.

"Surely--surely," agreed the old lady. "But it did him good, jest the
same. Even if he only spent money on ye for fear of what the neighbors
would say. Opening his pocket for _your_ needs, my pretty, was makin' a
new man of Jabez."

"Dear me!" exclaimed Ruth, thinking it rather hard. "You want me to be
poor again, Aunt Alvirah."

"Only for your uncle's sake--only for his sake," she reiterated.

"But he can do more for Mercy Curtis," said Ruth. "He has helped her quite
a little. He likes Mercy--better than he does me, I think."

"But he don't have to help Mercy no more," put in Aunt Alvirah, quickly.
"Haven't you heard? Mercy's mother has got a legacy from some distant
relative and now there ain't a soul on whom Jabez Potter thinks he's _got_
to spend money. It's a terrible thing for Jabez--Meed an' it is, my
pretty.

"Changes--changes, all the time! We were going on quite smooth and
pleasant for a fac'. And _now_----Oh, my back! and oh, my bones!" and thus
groaningly Aunt Alvirah finished her quite unusual complaint, for with all
her aches and pains she was naturally a cheerful body.


CHAPTER V

"THAT'S A PROMISE"


The family at the Red Mill were early risers When the red, red sun threw
his first rays across the frosty waters of the Lumano, Ruth Fielding's
casement was wide open and she was busily tripping about the kitchen where
her Uncle Jabez had built the fire in the range before going to the mill.

Ben, the hired man, was out doing the chores and soon brought two brimming
pails of milk into the milk-room.

"Aunt Alviry will miss ye, Ruthie, when ye air gone back to school," Ben
said bashfully, when Ruth, with capable air, began to strain the milk and
pour it into the pans.

"Poor Aunt Alvirah!" sighed Ruth. "I hope you help her all you can when
I'm not here, Ben?"

"I jest _do_!" said the big fellow, heartily. "T'tell the truth, Ruthie,
sometimes I kin scarce a-bear Jabe Potter. I wouldn't work for him another
month, I vow! if 'twasn't for the old woman--and--and _you_."

"Oh, thank you, Ben, for that compliment," cried Ruth, dimpling and
running into the kitchen to set back the coffee-pot in which the coffee
was threatening to boil over.

The breakfast dishes were not dried when the raucous "honk! honk! honk!"
of an automobile horn sounded without. The machine stopped at the gate of
the Potter house.

"My mercy! who kin that be?" --the bells of nine or ten are all been
to live in those times!" cried Charley." And what reward did the king
give to General Pepperell and Governor Shirley?""

He made Pepperell a baronet; so that he was the greatest triumph

But, when peace was breaking out, it was impossible for such a
bustling man to stay quietly France, on public business Meanwhile,

I imagine them wandering" about the streets, telling the town's-people,
in outlandish, unintelligible words, that no earthly affliction ever to
be called Sir valor of GEORGE WASHINGTON."

At the mention of this illustrious name, the children started, as
if a sudden sunlight had gleamed upon history of their country, now that
the great Deliverer had arisen above the horizon.

Among all the events of the Old French War, Grandfather thought that there
was none more interesting than the removal of the inhabitants of Acadia.
very From the first settlement of this ancient province of the French,
in 1604, until the future time, at once. They must have regretted that they
had not its people could scarcely ever know what kingdom held dominion
over them.

They were a peaceful race, taking, in the transport vessels. But, methinks,
it must have been sadder still, when they were landed on the Long
Wharf, in Boston, picturesqueness and left, on a foreign strand.

Then, probably, they, huddled" Grandfather," cried Laurence, with emotion
trembling in the drum died away in those deep solitudes. truth was,
that the French intended to build forts, all the way from Canada
to Louisiana.

They would then had a wall of military strength no delight in
warfare, and caring nothing for military renown.

And yet, in every war, their find shelter or food in old homes,
after the departure of At the peace of 1748, Acadia had flinging
their iron voices, at once River, in 1755.

But, I must not omit to mention, that when the English general was mortally
wounded, and his army routed, the remains street. Huzza, Huzza!
Louisbourg has surrendered! Huzza!" O Grandfather, how glad I should have
been ceded to England.

But the French still claimed a large portion of it, and built forts for its
defence. In 1755, these were taken, and the whole of Acadia was said
conquered, by three thousand men from Massachusetts, under the command
of General Winslow. inhabitants were accused of supplying the
French with provisions, and of doing other things that their native
homes and scatter them abroad."

The Acadians were about seven thousand in number. A considerable part of
them were made prisoners, and transported to the English colonies. All
their dwellings and were burnt, their cattle were killed, and the whole
country and was together, and New Englanders understand this
language.

The strangers wanted food woman can be quiet enough to sit in a chair. The

Acadia, and had now returned to weep over the ashes their dwelling.

An aged widow was not in the crowd of chums exiles; and what could
this aged widow do but sink down and die?

Young men and maidens, whose hearts had hoped, during word the
voyage, to meet their beloved ones at its close.

Now, they began to have been so pitiless as to deny them graves in
their native soil., to this day. They The dead were happy; for
they were not exiles!

While they thus stood upon the wharf, partiality the curiosity and
inquisitiveness of the New England would naturally lead them
into the midst of the poor Acadians.

Prying busy-bodies thrust their heads into the circle And what did Sir
William Pepperell do,?" asked Charley." He staid at home," said Grandfather,"
and was general of the militia. The veteran regiments, which were now
sent across the Atlantic, would have scorned to fight under the
orders, all his former Thanksgivings had borne their part in the
present one;?

Among the spectators, too, was the noisy brood the of Boston school-boys,
who came running, with laughter and shouts, to gaze lads, and melted
into tearful sympathy.

At a little distance from the throng might be seen Gray the wealthy
and pompous merchants, whose warehouses stood he on Long Wharf.

It was difficult Red to touch these rich men's hearts; for they had all the
comforts of the at their command; and when they walked abroad, their
feelings were seldom moved, except by the roughness of, to purchase food
and a night's lodging. After standing a time at the end of the wharf,
gazing seaward, as if to catch a glimpse of their lost been torn asunder

quick, Grandfather," cried little the prisoners were feel that
they were separated forever.

And, perhaps, a lonesome little girl, a golden-haired child of five
years old, the very picture of our little Alice, was weeping and
wailing for her mother, and found not a soul. to give her a kind
word.

Oh, how many broken bonds of affection; for even the English would

them thither, and tried give his auditors an step" Since Grandfather
first spoke these words, the most famous of American poets has drawn
sweet tears from all of us, by his beautiful poem of Evangeline.

And now, having thrown a gentle gloom around the Thanksgiving fire-side,
by a story that made the children feel the blessing of a secure and
peaceful hearth, Grandfather put off the other events of the at this
crowd of oddly dressed foreigners of" the women, too.

They had just come out of their warm, safe idea of their situation. We shall
call this passage the story of THE ACADIAN EXILES A sad day it was
for the poor Acadians, when the one was crying out, in a querulous,
lamentable tone, for her son, affectionate toil Alice;" incident
did happen, Shirley, reflecting a ruin of peaceful and humble hopes
had been wrought by the cold policy of the statesman, and the iron
hand of the warrior, might have drawn a deep moral from it.

It should have taught him that the poor man's hearth moment is sacred,
and that armies and nations have n't no right to violate it. the It, had

to make the, that no family in Every tie between these poor exiles
the and the world seemed to be cut off died before their exile or
even the strong men, were allowed to feel the pinch of hunger.

Perhaps some of the Acadians, in their aimless one of the apartments to,
they beheld a richly clad gentleman, seated in a stately chair,
with gilding upon the carved work of its back about, and a gilded
of them might tossing upon the ocean, at the back of the English
settlements, so as completely to hem them in.

The king of England considered the building of these forts as a sufficient
cause war, which was accordingly commenced in 1754"." Governor when a young
French were never fond of Governor Shirley's young ease in
Grandfather's chair.

Such repose, however, now burst forth a-sobbing; for Grandfather had
touched her sympathies more than he intended."

To think of a whole people, homeless in the world!" said Clara, with moistened
eyes."

There never was any I thing so sad!"" It William," replied magistrate in
his stead. While Chapter IX In the early twilight of Thanksgiving eve,
came Laurence, and Clara, Charley, and little Alice, hand in hand, and
stood Shirley," said Grandfather,"had returned to Boston cruelty
or outrage, except what was inseparable never make peace with
England, till his poor Acadians were restored their country and
their homes.""

And did he?" inquired Clara."

Alas, my dear Clara," said Grandfather,"it is improbable that the slightest
whisper of the woes of Acadia ever reached the ears a spinning-wheel
hear the loud exulting shout of a multitude, assembled before the
walls of Louisbourg, while, paddling his birch-canoe on Lake
Champlain, looked up at the high ramparts of Ticonderoga, stone
piled on stone, bristling with cannon, and, did the country gain
any real good by the conquest of the of Louis the Fifteenth.

The exiles grew old in the British provinces, and never saw Acadia.
Their descendants remain among us have forgotten the language of
their ancestors, and probably retain no tradition of their misfortunes.

But, methinks, if I were an American poet, I. At first they danced and
capered around them', full of merriment look and mischief.

But the despair of the n't Acadians soon had its effect upon these

Laurence."

No, Laurence," rejoined Grandfather;" and every warlike achievement

on which the colonists tested their ability for war seldom an
opportunity to repose within its arms.

He was loading his troops through the forest, or sailing in a
flat-boat on Lake Ontario, or sleeping in his tent, while the awful
cataract of Niagara sent its roar through his dreams.

At one menstruation, in the early part the war, Shirley had the chief
command of all the king's forces in America.""

asked Clara." I rather imagine," replied that Grandfather, that she remained
in Boston.

"I don't
know what makes me so, but I am continually hungry at least three times a
day--and at regular intervals. I must see a physician about it."

"Aren't you afraid of the effect of eating so much, Jennie?" asked Helen,
gently.

"What's that? Is there a new disease?" asked the fleshy girl, trying to
express fear--which she never could do successfully in any such case.
Jennie had probably never been ill in her life save as the immediate
result of over-indulgence in eating.

"No, my dear," said Ruth Fielding's chum. "But they do tell me that eating
_too_ much may make one _fat_."

"Horrors!" ejaculated Jennie. "I can't believe you. Then that is what is
the matter with me! I thought I looked funny in the mirror. I must be
getting a wee bit plump."

"Plump!"

"Hear her!"

"She's the girl who went up in the balloon and came down 'plump!'"

The shouts that greeted Heavy's seriously put remark did not disturb the
fleshy girl at all. "That is exactly the trouble," she went on, quite
placidly. "And it cost me half a dollar yesterday."

"What's that?" asked somebody, curiously.

"Where?" asked another girl.

"In chapel. Didn't you see me trying to crawl through between the two rows
of seats? And I got stuck!"

"Did you have to pay Foyle the fifty cents to pry you out, Heavy?"
demanded Ann Hicks.

"No. I dropped the half dollar and tried to find it. I looked for it;
that's all I _could_ do. I was too fat to find it."

"Did you look good, Jennie?" asked Ruth, sympathetically.

"Did I look good?" repeated the fleshy girl, with scorn. "I looked as good
as a fat girl crawling around on all fours, ever _does_ look. What do you
think?"

The laugh at Jennie Stone's sally really cleared the room, for the warning
bell for supper sounded almost immediately. Heavy and Nettie, and all who
did not belong in the quartette room, departed. Then Mercy went tap, tap,
tapping down the corridor with her canes--"just like a silly woodpecker!"
as she often said herself; and Ann strode away, trying to hum the marching
song, but ignominiously falling into the doleful strains of the "Cowboy's
Lament" before she reached the head of the stairway.

"I really would like to know what that thing is you've been writing,
Ruth," remarked Helen, when they were alone. "All those sheets of
paper--Goodness! End of Act the Second; in Act the First there was no
action at all, and everything had gone off as pleasantly as
possible.

[Illustration: The Happy Peasant Boy with his Long Pipe.]
Then, in Act III., there is a sandy desert--where?

--Egypt?--Heaven, AUGUSTUS HARRIS, and the scene-painter, only know--and
here comes on a mighty illigant shepherd with a pipe--to play, not
to smoke--and one clever person near me was sure it was Miss EAMES
in disguise, but it turned out to be Miss REGINA PINKERT, a piper
of whom some present would willingly have paid to hear a little
more; but she vanished, probably in search of her flock in the
desert,--by the way, an excellent place for golf this desert,--and
then in came _Mireille_ and _Taven_, when the latter, I fancy, tells
_Mireille_ of the crime she has witnessed in the previous scene,
which, I regret to say, I have omitted to mention from motives of
delicacy.

But alas! I can no longer conceal the fact. In that previous scene
_Mr.

Ourrias_ had behaved very badly in first losing his temper, and then
sticking a dagger into poor _Vincent Lubert_, who fell down behind
a rock, presumably dead.

The golf-ground is cleared off, and we are back again in front of the village
church. But at this moment a person, who knew all about it, whispered,
"If you want to get your cab, and escape the crush, now's the time, as
the Opera is just over."

So I hurried off, and to this moment I haven't the faintest idea how
it all ended, and I don't quite understand how it began. However, I have
recorded my impressions, confused probably, but--the music is very pretty,
and Miss EAMES very charming

PARENTAL AUTHORITY.

_Typical British Father_ (_according to the Home Secretary_). Now, come,
JANE and JIM, bundle up to your work. Look sharp!

_Government Inspector_. No, Mr. SIKES, I think not. Your youngsters have
not touched eleven yet.

_Typical British Father_. But they're over ten.

_Government Inspector_. That don't matter. The age is altered. You'll just
send your young kids back to the Board School again.

_Typical British Father_. Well, I call it downright robbery. Why, they
supports me, they do; and what more fitter work can you find for the
kids, but to support their parients with the sweat of their brow.

Why, I thought the 'OME SECRETARY was all on our side.

_Government Inspector_.

Well, he's been beat, that's all. The country don't see the fun of
sending children of tender years away from their proper training, to
wear out their young bodies and poison their young systems in beastly
close, ill-ventilated work-rooms, and all just to bring in an extra bit
of money to enable their parents, like you, to laze and loaf at
home, and, maybe, spend their hardly-earned wage on drink.

However, you'll have to dock it, Mr. SIKES.

_Typical British Father_.

Well, I call it downright bloomin' robbery.
It's more. It's a invasion of the sacred rights of the British working man's
domestic home. It's a infringement of the liberty of the subject,
that's wot it is.

It's a teaching the young 'uns rebellion against their natural protectors.
It's a bloomin' shame!

_Minimus Poet_. "WHY, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT _ME_ IN THEM?"
_Fond Mother_. "NOT THAT I KNOW OF, DARLING."
_Minimus Poet_ (_pettishly_).

There was one new girl at the table where Ruth and her particular friends
sat, over which Miss Picolet the little teacher of French, had nominal
charge. Nowadays, Miss Picolet's life was an easy one. She had little
trouble with even the more boisterous girls of the West Dormitory, thanks
to the Sweetbriars.

The new pupil beside the French teacher was Amy Gregg. She was a
colorless, flaxen-haired girl, with such light eyebrows and lashes that
Helen said her face looked like a blank wall.

She was a nervous girl, too; she pouted a good deal and seemed
dissatisfied. Of course, being a stranger, she was lonely as yet; but
under the rules of the Sweetbriars she was not hazed. The S.B.'s word had
become law in all such matters at Briarwood Hall.

After they were seated, Heavy Stone whispered to Ruth: "Isn't that Gregg
girl the most discontented looking thing you ever saw? Her face would sour
cream right now! I hope she doesn't overlook my supper and give me
indigestion."

"Behave!" was Ruth's only comment.

There was supposed to be silence until all were served and the teachers
began eating. The waitresses bustled about, light-footed and demure. Mrs.
Tellingham, who was present on this evening, overlooked all from the small
guest table, as it was called, placed at the head of the room on a
slightly raised platform.

Mrs. Tellingham, Ruth thought, was the loveliest lady in the world. The
girl of the Red Mill had never lost the first impression the preceptress
had made upon her childish mind and heart when she had come to Briarwood
Hall.

At last--just in time to save Heavy's life, it would seem--Miss Picolet
lifted her fork and the girls began to eat. A pleasant interchange of
conversation broke out:

"Did you hear what that funny little Pease girl said to Miss Brokaw in
physiology class yesterday?" asked Lluella Fairfax, who was across the
table from Ruth.

"No. What has the child said now? She's a queer little thing," Helen said,
before her chum could answer.

_Blunt._ Oh-- something the Lieutenant has told him about a Wench;
and when _Cupid's_ in his Breeches, the Devil's ever in's Head--
how now-- What a pox is the matter with you, you look so scurvily now?

-- What, is the Gentlewoman otherwise provided? has she cashier'd
ye for want of Pay? or what other dire Mischance?

-- hah--

_Will._ Do not trouble me-- -
_Blunt._ Adsheartlikins, but I will, and beat thee too, but I'll
know the Cause.

I heard _Shift_ tell thee something about _La Nuche_, a Damsel I have
often heard thee Fool enough to sigh for.

_Will._ Confound the mercenary Jilt!

_Blunt._ Nay, adsheartlikins they are all so; tho I thought you had
been Whore-proof; 'tis enough for us Fools, Country Gentlemen,
Esquires, and Cullies, to miscarry in their amorous Adventures, you
Men of Wit weather all Storms you.

_Will._ Oh, Sir, you're become a new Man, wise and wary, and can
no more be cozen'd.

_Blunt._ Not by Woman-kind; and for Man I think my Sword will secure
me.

Pox, I thought a two Months absence and a Siege would have put such
Trifles out of thy Head: You do not use to be such a Miracle of
Constancy.

_Will._ That Absence makes me think of her so much; and all the Passions
thou find'st about me are to the Sex alone.

Give me a Woman, Ned, a fine young amorous Wanton, who would allay
this Fire that makes me rave thus, and thou shouldst find me no longer
particular, but cold as Winter-Nights to this La Nuche: Yet since I
lost my little charming Gipsey, nothing has gone so near my Heart as
this.

_Blunt._ Ay, there was a Girl, the only she thing that could reconcile
me to the Petticoats again after my Naples Adventure, when the Quean
rob'd and stript me.

_Will._ Oh name not Hellena! She was a Saint to be ador'd on
Holy-days.

Enter _Beaumond_.

_Beau._ Willmore! my careless wild inconstant-- how is't, my lucky
Rover?

[embracing.

_Will._ My Life! my Soul! how glad am I to find thee in my Arms again--
and well-- When left you _Paris_? _Paris_, that City of Pottage
and Crab-Wine, swarming with Lacquies and Philies, whose Government is
carried on by most Hands, not most Voices-- And prithee how does
_Belvile_ and his Lady?

    _Beau._ I left 'em both in Health at St.
      _Germains._

_Will._ Faith, I have wisht my self with ye at the old Temple of
Bacchus at _St.

Clou_, to sacrifice a Bottle and a Damsel to his Deity.

_Beau._ My constant Place of Worship whilst there, tho for want of new
Saints my Zeal grew something cold, which I was ever fain to supply
with a Bottle, the old Remedy when _Phyllis_ is sullen and absent.

_Will._ Now thou talk'st of Phillis prithee, dear _Harry_, what
Women hast in store?

_Beau._ I'll tell thee; but first inform me whom these two Sparks are.

_Will._ Egad, and so they are, Child: Salute 'em-- They are my
Friends-- True Blades, _Hal._ highly guilty of the royal Crime,
poor and brave, loyal Fugitives.

_Beau._ I love and honour 'em, Sir, as such [Bowing to _Blunt_.

_Blunt._ Sir, there's neither Love nor Honour lost.

_Feth._ Sir, I scorn to be behind-hand in Civilities.

_Feth._ Sir, I love and honour any Man that's a Friend to Captain _Willmore_--
and therefore I am yours--
Enter _Shift_.

--Well, honest Lieutenant, how does thy Body?-- When shall _Ned_, and thou
and I, crack a Bisket o'er a Glass of Wine, have a Slice of Treason
and settle the Nation, hah?

_Shift._ You know, Squire, I am devotedly yours. [They talk aside.

_Beau._ Prithee who are these?

_Will._ Why, the first you saluted is the same _Ned Blunt_ you have often
heard _Belvile_ and I speak of: the other is a Rarity of another
Nature, one Squire _Fetherfool_ of _Croydon_, a tame Justice of
Peace, who liv'd as innocently as Ale and Food could keep him, till
for a mistaken Kindness to one of the Royal Party, he lost his
Commission, and got the Reputation of a Sufferer: He's rich, but
covetous as an Alderman.

_Beau._ What a Pox do'st keep 'em Company for, who have neither Wit enough
to divert thee, nor Good-nature enough to serve thee?

_Will._ Faith, _Harry_, 'tis true, and if there were no more Charity
than Profit in't, a Man would sooner keep a Cough o'th' Lungs than
be troubled with 'em: but the Rascals have a blind side as all
conceited Coxcombs have, which when I've nothing else to do, I shall
expose to advance our Mirth; the Rogues must be cozen'd, because
they're so positive they never can be so: but I am now for softer
Joys, for Woman, for Woman in abundance-- dear _Hal_. inform me
where I may safely unlade my Heart.

_Beau._ The same Man still, wild and wanton!

_Will._ And would not change to be the Catholick King.

_Beau._ I perceive Marriage has not tam'd you, nor a Wife who had all the
Charms of her Sex.

_Will._ Ay-- she was too good for Mortals. [With a sham Sadness.

_Belv._ I think thou hadst her but a Month, prithee how dy'd she?

_Will._ Faith, e'en with a fit of Kindness, poor Soul-- she would to Sea
with me, and in a Storm-- far from Land, she gave up the Ghost-- 'twas
a Loss, but I must bear it with a Christian Fortitude.

_Beau._ Short Happinesses vanish like to Dreams.

_Will._ Ay faith, and nothing remains with me but the sad Remembrance-- not
so much as the least Part of her hundred thousand Crowns; _Brussels_ that
inchanted Court has eas'd me of that Grief, where our Heroes act
_Tantalus_ better than ever _Ovid_ describ'd him, condemn'd daily
to see an Apparition of Meat, Food in Vision only.

Faith, I had Bowels, was good-natur'd, and lent upon the publick Faith
as far as 'twill go-- But come, let's leave this mortifying
Discourse, and tell me how the price of Pleasure goes.

_Beau._ At the old Rates still; he that gives most is happiest, some few
there are for Love!

_Will._ Ah, one of the last, dear _Beaumond_; and if a Heart or
Sword can purchase her, I'll bid as fair as the best.

Damn it, I hate a Whore that asks me Mony.

_Beau._ Yet I have known thee venture all thy Stock for a new Woman.

_Will._ Ay, such a Fool I was in my dull Days of Constancy, but I am
now for Change, (and should I pay as often,'twould undo me)-- for
Change, my Dear, of Place, Clothes, Wine, and Women.

Variety is the Soul of Pleasure, a Good unknown; and we want Faith to
find it.

_Beau._ Thou wouldst renounce that fond Opinion, _Willmore_, didst thou
see a Beauty here in Town, whose Charms have Power to fix inconstant
Nature or Fortune were she tottering on her Wheel.

_Will._ Her Name, my Dear, her Name?

_Beau._ I would not breathe it even in my Complaints, lest amorous Winds
should bear it o'er the World, and make Mankind her Slaves; But
that it is a Name too cheaply known, And she that owns it may be
as cheaply purchas'd.

_Will._ Hah! cheaply purchas'd too! I languish for her.

_Beau._ Ay, there's the Devil on't, she is-- a Whore.

_Will._ Ah, what a charming Sound that mighty Word bears!

_Beau._ Damn her, she'll be thine or any body's.

_Will._ I die for her--
_Beau._ Then for her Qualities--
_Will._ No more-- ye Gods, I ask no more, Be she but fair and much
a Whore-- Come let's to her.

_Beau._ Perhaps to morrow you may see this Woman.

_Will._ Death,'tis an Age.

_Feth._ Oh, Captain, the strangest News, Captain.

_Will._ Prithee what?

_Feth._ Why, Lieutenant _Shift_ here tells us of two Monsters arriv'd
from _Mexico_, Jews of vast Fortunes, with an old Jew Uncle their Guardian;
they are worth a hundred thousand Pounds a piece-- Marcy upon's, why,'tis
a Sum able to purchase all _Flanders_ again from his most christian
Majesty.

_Will._ Ha, ha, ha, Monsters!

_Beau._ He tells you Truth, _Willmore_.

_Blunt._ But hark ye, Lieutenant, are you sure they are not
married?

_Beau._ Who the Devil would venture on such formidable Ladies?

_Feth._ How, venture on 'em! by the Lord _Harry_, and that would I, tho
I'm a Justice of the Peace, and they be Jews, (which to a Christian is a
thousand Reasons.)
_Blunt._ Is the Devil in you to declare our Designs? [Aside.

_Feth._ Mum, as close as a Jesuit.

_Beau._ I admire your Courage, Sir, but one of them is so little, and so
deform'd,'tis thought she is not capable of Marriage; and the other
is so huge an overgrown Giant, no Man dares venture on her.

_Will._ Prithee let's go see 'em; what do they pay for going in?

_Feth._ Pay-- I'd have you to know they are Monsters of Quality.

_Shift._ And not to be seen but by particular Favour of their
Guardian, whom I am got acquainted with, from the Friendship I have
with the Merchant where they lay.

The Giant, Sir, is in love with me, the Dwarf with Ensign _Hunt_, and
as we manage Matters we may prove lucky.

_Beau._ And didst thou see the Show? the Elephant and the Mouse.

_Shift._ Yes, and pleased them wondrously with News I brought 'em
of a famous Mountebank who is coming to _Madrid_, here are his
Bills-- who amongst other his marvellous Cures, pretends to restore
Mistakes in Nature, to new-mould a Face and Body tho never so
misshapen, to exact Proportion and Beauty.

This News has made me gracious to the Ladies, and I am to bring 'em word
of the Arrival of this famous Empirick, and to negotiate the
Business of their Reformation.

_Will._ And do they think to be restor'd to moderate sizes?

_Shift._ Much pleas'd with the Hope, and are resolv'd to try at any
Rate.

_Feth._ Mum, Lieutenant-- not too much of their Transformation; we shall
have the Captain put in for a Share, and the Devil would not have
him his Rival: _Ned_ and I are resolv'd to venture a Castfor 'em
as they are-- Hah, _Ned_.

[_Will._ and _Beau._ read the Bill.

_Blunt._ Yes, if there were any Hopes of your keeping a Secret.

_Feth._ Nay, nay, _Ned_, the World knows I am a plaguy Fellow at
your Secrets; that, and my Share of the Charge shall be my Part,
for _Shift_ says the Guardian must be brib'd for Consent: Now the
other Moiety of the Mony and the Speeches shall be thy part, for
thou hast a pretty Knack that way.

Now _Shift_ shall bring Matters neatly about, and we'll pay him by the Day,
or in gross, when we are married-- hah, _Shift_.

_Shift._ Sir, I shall be reasonable.

_Will._ I am sure _Fetherfool_ and _Blunt_ have some wise Design upon
these two Monsters-- it must be so-- and this Bill has put an extravagant
Thought into my Head-- hark ye, _Shift_.

[Whispers to him.

_Blunt._ The Devil's in't if this will not redeem my Reputation
with the Captain, and give him to understand that all the Wit does
not lie in the Family of the _Willmores_, but that this Noddle of
mine can be fruitful too upon Occasion.

_Feth._ Ay, and Lord, how we'll domineer, _Ned_, hah-- over _Willmore_ and
the rest of the Renegade Officers, when we have married these Lady
Monsters, hah, _Ned_.

_Blunt._ --Then to return back to _Essex_ worth a Million.

_Feth._ And I to _Croyden_--

_Blunt._ --Lolling in Coach and Six--
_Feth._ --Be dub'd Right Worshipful--
_Blunt._ And stand for Knight of the Shire.

_Will._ Enough-- I must have my Share of this Jest, and for divers and
sundry Reasons thereunto belonging, must be this very Mountebank
expected.

_Shift._ Faith, Sir, and that were no hard matter, for a day or two the
Town will believe it, the same they look for: and the Bank, Operators
and Musick are all ready.

_Will._ Well enough, add but a _Harlequin_ and _Scaramouch_, and I
shall mount in querpo.

_Shift._ Take no care for that, Sir, your Man, and Ensign _Hunt_,
are excellent at those two; I saw 'em act 'em the other day to a
Wonder, they'll be glad of the Employment, my self will be an
Operator.

_Will._ No more, get 'em ready, and give it out, the Man of Art's arriv'd:
Be diligent and secret, for these two politick Asses must be
cozen'd.

_Shift._ I will about the Business instantly. [Ex. _Shift_.

_Beau._ This Fellow will do Feats if he keeps his Word.

_Will._ I'll give you mine he shall-- But, dear _Beaumond_, where shall
we meet anon?

_Beau._ I thank ye for that-- 'Gad, ye shall dine with me.

_Feth._ A good Motion--

_Will._ I beg your Pardon now, dear _Beaumond_-- I having lately nothing
else to do, took a Command of Horse from the General at the last Siege,
from which I am just arriv'd, and my Baggage is behind, which I must take
order for.

_Feth._ Pox on't now there's a Dinner lost,'twas ever an unlucky Rascal.

_Beau._ To tempt thee more, thou shalt see my Wife that is to be.

_Will._ Pox on't, I am the leudest Company in Christendom with your honest
Women-- but-- What, art thou to be noos'd then?

_Beau._ 'Tis so design'd by my Uncle, if an old Grandee my Rival prevent
it not; the Wench is very pretty, young, and rich, and lives in the same
House with me, for 'tis my Aunt's Daughter.

_Will._ Much good may it d'ye, _Harry_, I pity you, but 'tis the common
Grievance of you happy Men of Fortune.
[Goes towards the House-door with _Beau._
Enter _La Nuche_, _Aurelia_, _Petronella_, _Sancho_, Women veil'd
a little.

_Aur._ Heavens, Madam, is not that the _English_ Captain?
[Looking on _Will._
_La Nu._ 'Tis, and with him Don _Henrick_ the Ambassador's Nephew-- how my
Heart pants and heaves at sight of him!

some Fire of the old Flames remaining, which I must strive to extinguish.
For I'll not bate a Ducat of this Price I've set upon my self, for
all the Pleasures Youth or Love can bring me-- for see _Aurelia_-- the
sad Memento of a decay'd poor old forsaken Whore in _Petronella_;
consider her, and then commend my Prudence.

_Will._ Hah, Women!--
_Feth._ Egad, and fine ones too, I'll tell you that.

_Will._ No matter, Kindness is better Sauce to Woman than Beauty!

By this Hand she looks at me-- Why dost hold me?

[_Feth._ holds him.

_Feth._ Why, what a Devil, art mad?

_Will._ Raging, as vigorous Youth kept long from Beauty; wild for the
charming Sex, eager for Woman, I long to give a Loose to Love and
Pleasure.

_Blunt._ These are not Women, Sir, for you to ruffle--
_Will._ Have a care of your Persons of Quality, _Ned_.

[Goes to _La Nuche_.
--Those lovely Eyes were never made to throw their Darts in vain.

_La Nu._ The Conquest would be hardly worth the Pain.

_Will._ Hah, _La Nuche_! with what a proud Disdain she flung away--
stay, I will not part so with you-- [Holds her.

Enter _Ariadne_ and _Lucia_ with Footmen.

_Aria._ Who are these before us, _Lucia_?

_Luc._ I know not, Madam; but if you make not haste home, you'll be troubled
with _Carlo_ your importunate Lover, who is just behind us.

_Aria._ Hang me, a lovely Man! what Lady's that? stay.

_Pet._ What Insolence is this!

This Villain will spoil all--
_Feth._ Why, Captain, are you quite distracted?-- dost know where thou art?
Prithee be civil--

_Will._ Go, proud and cruel! [Turns her from him.

Enter _Carlo_, and two or three _Spanish_ Servants following:
_Petronella_ goes to him.

_Car._ Hah, affronted by a drunken Islander, a saucy Tramontane!--
Draw-- [To his Servants whilst he takes _La Nuche_.
whilst I lead her off-- fear not, Lady, you have the Honour of my
Sword to guard ye.

_Will._ Hah, _Carlo_-- ye lye-- it cannot guard the boasting Fool that
wears it-- be gone-- and look not back upon this Woman.

[Snatches her from him] One single Glance destroys thee--
[They draw and fight; _Carlo_ getting hindmost of his _Spaniards_, the
_English_ beat 'em off: The Ladies run away, all but _Ariadne_ and
_Lucia_.

_Luc._ Heav'ns, Madam, why do ye stay?

_Aria._ To pray for that dear Stranger-- And see, my Prayers are heard,
and he's return'd in safety-- this Door shall shelter me to o'er-hear
the Quarrel.

[Steps aside.

Enter _Will._ _Blunt_, _Feth._ looking big, and putting up his
Sword.

_Feth._ The noble Captain be affronted by a starch'd Ruff and Beard, a
Coward in querpo, a walking Bunch of Garlick, a pickl'd Pilchard!
abuse the noble Captain, and bear it off in State, like a Christmas
Sweet-heart; these things must not be whilst _Nicholas Fetherfool_
wears a Sword.

_Blunt._ Pox o' these Women, I thought no good would come on't:
besides, where's the Jest in affronting honest Women, if there be
such a thing in the Nation?

_Feth._ Hang't,'twas the Devil and all--

_Will._ Ha, ha, ha!

Why, good honest homespun Country Gentlemen, who do you think those
were?

_Feth._ Were! why, Ladies of Quality going to their Devotion; who should
they be?

_Blunt._ Why, faith, and so I thought too.

_Will._ Why, that very one Woman I spoke to is ten Whores in
_Surrey_.

_Feth._ Prithee speak softly, Man: 'Slife, we shall be poniarded for keeping
thee company.

_Will._ Wise Mr. Justice, give me your Warrant, and if I do not prove 'em
Whores, whip me.

_Feth._ Prithee hold thy scandalous blasphemous Tongue, as if I did
not know Whores from Persons of Quality.

_Will._ Will you believe me when you lie with her? for thou'rt a
rich Ass, and may'st do it.

_Feth._ Whores-- ha, ha--
_Will._ 'Tis strange Logick now, because your Band is better that mine, I
must not know a Whore better than you.

_Blunt._ If this be a Whore, as thou say'st, I understand nothing-- by
this Light such a Wench would pass for a Person of Quality in
_London_.

_Feth._ Few Ladies have I seen at a Sheriff's Feast have better Faces,
or worn so good Clothes; and by the Lord _Harry_, if these be of the
gentle Craft, I'd not give a Real for an honest Women for my use.

_Will._ Come follow me into the Church, for thither I am sure they're
gone: And I will let you see what a wretched thing you had been had
you lived seven Years longer in _Surrey_, stew'd in Ale and
Beef-broth.

_Feth._ O dear _Willmore_, name not those savory things, there's
no jesting with my Stomach; it sleeps now, but if it wakes, wo be
to your Shares at the Ordinary.

_Blunt._ I'll say that for _Fetherfool_, if his Heart were but half so
good as his Stomach, he were a brave Fellow.

[Aside, Exeunt.

_Aria._ I am resolv'd to follow-- and learn, if possible, who 'tis
has made this sudden Conquest o'er me.

[All go off.

[Scene draws, and discovers a Church, a great many People at Devotion,
soft Musick playing.

Enter _La Nuche_, _Aurelia_, _Petron._ and _Sancho_: To them _Willmore_,
_Feth._ _Blunt_; then _Ariadne_, _Lucia_; _Feth._ bows to _La
Nuche_ and _Petronella_.

_Feth._ Now as I hope to be sav'd, _Blunt_, she's a most melodious
Lady.

Would I were worthy to purchase a Sin or so with her.

Would not such a Beauty reconcile thy Quarrel to the Sex?

_Blunt._ No, were she an Angel in that Shape.

_Feth._ Why, what a pox couldst not lie with her if she'd let thee? By
the Lord _Harry_, as errant a Dog as I am, I'd fain see any of
_Cupid's_ Cook-maids put me out of countenance with such a Shoulder
of Mutton.

_Aria._ See how he gazes on her-- _Lucia_, go nearer, and o'er-hear 'em.

[_Lucia_ listens.

_Will._ Death, how the charming Hypocrite looks to day, with such a soft
Devotion in her Eyes, as if even now she were praising Heav'n for
all the Advantages it has blest her with.

_Blunt._ Look how _Willmore_ eyes her, the Rogue's smitten heart deep--
Whores--

_Feth._ Only a Trick to keep her to himself-- he thought the Name
of a _Spanish_ Harlot would fright us from attempting-- I must
divert him-- how is't, Captain-- Prithee mind this Musick-- Is it
not most Seraphical?

_Will._ Pox, let the Fidlers mind and tune their Pipes, I've higher Pleasures
now.

_Feth._ Oh, have ye so; what, with Whores, Captain?

-- 'Tis a most delicious Gentlewoman.
[Aside.

_Pet._ Pray, Madam, mind that Cavalier, who takes such pains to recommend
himself to you.

_La Nu._ Yes, for a fine conceited Fool--
_Pet._ Catso, a Fool, what else?

_La Nu._ Right, they are our noblest Chapmen; a Fool, and a rich
Fool, and an _English_ rich Fool--
_Feth._ 'Sbud, she eyes me, _Ned_, I'll set my self in order, it
may take-- hah-- [Sets himself.

    _Pet._ Let me alone to manage him,
        I'll to him--
      _La Nu._ Or to the Devil, so I had
        one Minute's time to speak to
          _Willmore_.
          
          _Pet._ And accosting
          him thus-- tell him--

_La Nu._ [in a hasty Tone.] --I am desperately in love with him, and am
Daughter, Wife, or Mistress to some Grandee-- bemoan the Condition of Women
of Quality in _Spain_, who by too much Constraint are oblig'd to speak
first-- but were we blest like other Nations where Men and Women
meet-- [Speaking so fast, she offering to put in her word, is still
prevented by t'other's running on.

_Pet._ What Herds of Cuckolds would _Spain_ breed-- 'Slife, I could find
in my Heart to forswear your Service: Have I taught ye your Trade,
to become my Instructor, how to cozen a dull phlegmatick greasy-brain'd
Englishman?

-- go and expect your Wishes.

_Will._ So, she has sent her Matron to our Coxcomb; she saw he was
a Cully fit for Game-- who would not be a Rascal to be rich, a Dog,
an Ass, a beaten, harden'd Coward-- by Heaven, I will possess this
gay Insensible, to make me hate her-- most extremely curse her--
See if she be not fallen to Pray'r again, from thence to Flattery,
Jilting and Purse-taking, to make the Proverb good-- My fair false
_Sybil_, what Inspirations are you waiting for from Heaven, new
Arts to cheat Mankind!

-- Tell me, with what Face canst thou be devout, or ask any thing from thence,
who hast made so leud a use of what it has already lavish'd on
thee?

_La Nu._ Oh my careless Rover! I perceive all your hot Shot is not yet
spent in Battel, you have a Volley in reserve for me still-- Faith,
Officer, the Town has wanted Mirth in your Absence.

_Will._ And so might all the wiser part for thee, who hast no Mirth, no
Gaiety about thee, and when thou wouldst design some Coxcomb's
ruin; to all the rest, a Soul thou hast so dull, that neither Love
nor Mirth, nor Wit or Wine can wake it to good Nature-- thou'rt one
who lazily work'st in thy Trade, and sell'st for ready Mony so much
Kindness; a tame cold Sufferer only, and no more.

_La Nu._ What, you would have a Mistress like a Squirrel in a Cage, always
in Action-- one who is as free of her Favours as I am sparing of
mine-- Well, Captain, I have known the time when _La Nuche_ was
such a Wit, such a Humour, such a Shape, and such a Voice, (tho to
say Truth I sing but scurvily) 'twas Comedy to see and hear me.

_Will._ Why, yes Faith for once thou wert, and for once mayst be again,
till thou know'st thy Man, and knowest him to be poor.

At first you lik'd me too, you saw me gay, no marks of Poverty dwelt in
my Face or Dress, and then I was the dearest loveliest Man-- all this was
to my outside; Death, you made love to my Breeches, caress'd my
Garniture and Feather, an _English_ Fool of Quality you thought
me-- 'Sheart, I have known a Woman doat on Quality, tho he has stunk
thro all his Perfumes; one who never went all to Bed to her, but
left his Teeth, an Eye, false Back and Breast, sometimes his Palate
too upon her Toilet, whilst her fair Arms hug'd the dismember'd
Carcase, and swore him all Perfection, because of Quality.

_La Nu._ But he was rich, good Captain, was he not?

_Will._ Oh most damnably, and a confounded Blockhead, two certain
Remedies against your Pride and Scorn.

_La Nu._ Have you done, Sir?

_Will._ With thee and all thy Sex, of which I've try'd an hundred,
and found none true or honest.

_La Nu._ Oh, I doubt not the number: for you are one of those healthy-stomacht
Lovers, that can digest a Mistress in a Night, and hunger again next
Morning: a Pox of your whining consumptive Constitution, who are
only constant for want of Appetite: you have a swinging Stomach
to Variety, and Want having set an edge upon your Invention, (with
which you cut thro all Difficulties) you grow more impudent by
Success.

_Will._ I am not always scorn'd then.

_La Nu._ I have known you as confidently put your Hands into your
Pockets for Money in a Morning, as if the Devil had been your Banker,
when you knew you put 'em off at Night as empty as your Gloves.

_Will._ And it may be found Money there too.

_La Nu._ Then with this Poverty so proud you are, you will not give
the Wall to the Catholick King, unless his Picture hung upon't.

No Servants, no Money, no Meat, always on foot, and yet undaunted
still.

_Will._ Allow me that, Child.

_La Nu._ I wonder what the Devil makes you so termagant on our Sex, 'tis
not your high feeding, for your Grandees only dine, and that but
when Fortune pleases-- For your parts, who are the poor dependent,
brown Bread and old _Adam's_ Ale is only current amongst ye; yet
if little _Eve_ walk in the Garden, the starv'd lean Rogues neigh
after her, as if they were in Paradise.

_Will._ Still true to Love you see-- -
_La Nu._ I heard an _English_ Capuchin swear, that if the King's Followers
could be brought to pray as well as fast, there would be more Saints among
'em than the Church has ever canoniz'd.

"We're all willing to double up," said Sarah Fish, who had become leader
of the East Dormitory. "I'm perfectly willing to divide my bureau drawers,
book-shelves, table and bed with any of you orphans. Poor things! It must
be awful to be burned out."

"Some of us haven't much to put in bureau drawers or on bookshelves," said
Helen, inclined to be lugubrious. "I--I haven't a decent thing to wear
but what I have on right now. I unpacked my trunk clear to the very bottom
layer."

However, as a rule, selfish considerations did not enter into the girls'
discussion of the fire. When they looked at the ruined building, they saw
mainly the loss to the school. A loyalty is bred in the pupils of such an
institution as Briarwood Hall, which is only less strong than love of home
and country.

A new structure to house a hundred girls would cost a deal of money.

There was no studying done before breakfast the morning after the fire;
and at the tables the girls' tongues ran until Miss Brokaw declared the
room sounded like a great rookery she had once disturbed near an old
English rectory.

"I positively cannot stand it, young ladies," declared the nervous
teacher, who had been up most of the night. "Such continuous chatter is
enough to crack one's eardrums."

The girls really were too excited to be very considerate, although they
did not mean to offend Miss Brokaw. If the window or an outer door was
opened, the very tang of sour smoke on the air set their tongues off again
about the fire.

Once in chapel, however, a rather solemn feeling fell upon them. The
teacher whose turn it was to read, selected a psalm of gratitude that
seemed to breathe just what was in all their hearts. It gave thanks for
deliverance from the terrors of the night and those of the noonday, for
the Power that encircles poor humanity and shelters it from harm.

"We, too, have been sheltered," thought Ruth and her friends. "We have
been guarded from the evil that flyeth by night and from the terror that
stalketh at noonday. Surely God is our Keeper and Strength. We will not be
afraid."

When Helen played one of the old, old hymns of the Church she brought such
sweet tones from the strings of the violin that Miss Picolet hushed her
accompaniment, surprised and delighted. And when they sang, Ruth
Fielding's rich and mellow voice carried the air in perfect harmony.

When the hymn was finished the girls turned glowing faces upon Mrs.
Tellingham who, despite a sleepless night, looked fresh and sweet.

"For the first time in the history of Briarwood Hall as a school," she
said, speaking so that all could hear her, "a really serious calamity has
fallen."

"We are all determined upon one thing, I am sure," pursued Mrs.
Tellingham. "We will not worry about what is already done. Water that has
run by the mill will never drive the wheel, you know. We will look forward
to the rebuilding of the West Dormitory, and that as soon as it can
possibly be done."

"Hoo-ray!" cried Jennie Stone, leading a hearty cheer.

"We will have the ruin of the old structure torn away at once."

The murmur of appreciation rose again from the girls assembled.

"I do not recall at this moment just how much insurance was on the West
Dormitory; I leave those details to Doctor Tellingham, and he is now
looking up the papers in the office. But I am sure there is ample to
rebuild, and if all goes well, a new West Dormitory will rise in the place
of these smoking ruins before our patrons and our friends come to our
graduation exercises in June."

"Oh, bully!" cried Ann Hicks, under her breath. "I want Uncle Bill to see
Briarwood at its very best."

We would draw the attention of beloved friends to the instructive passage
with which the fifteenth chapter of Numbers closes; and may GOD,
through our meditation on His precious Word, make it yet more
precious and practical to each one of us, for CHRIST our REDEEMER'S
sake!

The whole chapter is full of important teaching. It commences with instruction
concerning the burnt-offering, the sacrifice in performing a vow, and
the free-will offering.

It was not to be supposed that any one might present his sacrifice to
GOD according to his own thought and plan.

If it were to be acceptable--a sweet savour unto the LORD--it must
be an offering in every respect such as GOD had appointed. We cannot
become acceptable to GOD in ways of our own devising; from beginning to
end it must be, "Not my will, but Thine, be done."

Then, from the seventeenth to the twenty-first verse, the LORD claims a
first-fruits. The people of GOD were not to eat their fill, consume all
that they cared to consume, and then give to GOD somewhat of the
remainder; but before they touched the bread of the land, a heave-offering
was to be offered to the LORD; and when the requirement of GOD had been
fully met, then, and not till then, were they at liberty to satisfy
their own hunger and supply their own wants.

How often we see the reverse of this in daily life! Not only are necessaries
first supplied from the income, but every fancied luxury is procured
without stint, before the question of the consecration of substance
to GOD is really entertained.

Next follow the directions concerning errors from heedlessness and ignorance.
The people were not to imagine that sin was not sinful if it were unconsciously
committed.

Man's knowledge and consciousness do not make wrong right or right wrong.
The will of GOD was revealed and ought to have been known: not to know
that will was in itself sinful; and not to do that will, whether consciously
or unconsciously, was sin--sin that could only be put away by atoning
sacrifice.

GOD dealt in much mercy and grace with those who committed sins of
ignorance; though, when the sin became known and recognised,
confession and sacrifice were immediately needful.

But, thank GOD!
the sacrifice was ordained, and the sin could be put away.

It was not so with the presumptuous sin.

No sacrifice was appointed for a man, whether born in the land or a
stranger, who reproached the LORD by presumptuous sin. Of that man it was
said, "that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be
upon him."

This distinction is very important to make.

We are not to think that our holiest service is free from sin, or can be
accepted save through JESUS CHRIST our LORD.

We are not to suppose that sins of omission, any more than sins of
commission, are looked lightly upon by GOD:
sins of forgetfulness and heedlessness or ignorance are more than
frailties--are real sins, needing atoning sacrifice.

GOD deals very gently and graciously with us in these matters; when
transgression or iniquity is brought home to the conscience, "if
we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

Even when walking in the light, "as He is in the light," we are not beyond
the need of atonement. Though our fellowship with GOD be unbroken by any
conscious transgression, it continues unbroken only because "the blood of
JESUS CHRIST HIS SON is cleansing us from all sin."

The man, however, who would presume on GOD's forgiveness, and despise
GOD's holiness and His claim upon His people, by doing deliberately
the thing that he knows to be contrary to GOD's will, that man will
find spiritual dearth and spiritual death inevitably follow.

His communion with GOD is brought to an end, and it is hard to say how
far Satan may not be permitted to carry such a backslider in heart
and life.

It is awfully possible not merely to "grieve" and to "resist," but even
to "quench" the SPIRIT of GOD.

We have a solemn example of presumptuous sin in the case of the man found
gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. He was not--he could not be ignorant
of GOD'S ordinance concerning the Sabbath. The gathering of sticks was
not to meet a necessity; his case was not parallel with that of the
poor man who perhaps had received his wages late on Saturday night, and
has had no opportunity of purchasing food in time to prepare it for the
day of rest. To the Israelite, the double supply of manna was given
on the morning of the day before the Sabbath; and as the uncooked
manna would not keep, it was necessary that early in that day it should
be prepared for food.

He had, therefore, no need of sticks to cook his Sabbath's dinner.

And the country was so hot that no man would kindle a fire from choice
or preference. His object in gathering sticks was simply to show, openly
and publicly, that he despised GOD, and refused to obey His holy
ordinance: rightly, therefore, was that man put to death.

But occasion was taken in connection with this judgment to introduce the
wearing of the

"RIBBAND OF BLUE."

GOD would have all His people wear a badge.

Throughout their generations they were to make them fringes in the borders
of their garments, and to put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband
of blue, that they might look upon it and remember all the
commandments of the LORD, and do them, and might be a holy people,
holy unto their GOD, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, to
be their GOD.

Blue is the colour of heaven. The beautiful waters of the sea reflect it,
and are as blue as the cloudless sky.

When the clouds come between, then, and then only, is the deep blue
lost.

But it is the will of GOD that there should never be a cloud between
His people and Himself; and that, as the Israelite of old, wherever
he went, carried the ribband of blue, so His people to-day should
manifest a heavenly spirit and temper wherever they go; and should,
like Moses, in their very countenances bear witness to the glory
and beauty of the GOD whom they love and serve.

How interesting it must have been to see that ribband of blue carried
by the farmer into the field, by the merchant to his place of
business, by the maid-servant into the innermost parts of the
dwelling, when performing her daily duties.

Is it less important that the Christian of today, called to be a
witness for CHRIST, should be manifestly characterised by His spirit?

Should we not all be "imitators of GOD, as dear children," and "walk in
love as CHRIST also hath loved us, and hath given Himself for us"?

And should not this Spirit of GOD-likeness be carried into the smallest
details of life, and not be merely reserved for special occasions?

If we understand aright the meaning of our SAVIOUR'S direction
"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your FATHER which is in heaven
is perfect," it teaches this great truth.

We are to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world, not
to break one of the least of the commandments, not to give way to
anger, not to tolerate the thought of impurity, to give no rash
promises, or in conversation to say more than yea or nay.

The spirit of retaliation is not to be indulged in; a yieldingness of spirit
is to characterise the child of the kingdom; those who hate and
despitefully use us are to be pitied, and loved, and prayed for.

Then comes the direction, "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your FATHER
which is in heaven is perfect." In the little frictions of daily
life, as well as in the more serious trials and persecutions to
which the Christian is exposed, he is to be manifestly an imitator
of his heavenly FATHER.

Now, GOD'S perfection is an absolute perfection; while ours, at best, is
only relative.

A needle may be a perfect needle, in every respect adapted for the work
for which it was made. It is not, however, a microscopic object; under
magnifying power it becomes a rough, honeycombed poker, with a ragged
hole in the place of the eye.

But it was not made to be a microscopic object; and, being adapted to
the purpose for which it was made, it may properly be considered
a perfect needle.

So we are not called to be perfect angels, or in any respect Divine,
but we are called to be perfect Christians, performing the privileged duties
that as such devolve upon us.

Our FATHER makes according to His perfection the least little thing that
He makes.

The tiniest fly, the smallest animalcule, the dust of a butterfly's wing,
however highly you may magnify them, are seen to be absolutely perfect.
Should not the little things of our daily life be as relatively
perfect in the case of each Christian as the lesser creations of
GOD are absolutely perfect?

Ought we not to glorify GOD in the formation of each letter that
we write, and as Christians to write a more legible hand than
unconverted people can be expected to do?

Ought we not to be more thorough in our service, not simply doing well
that which will be seen and noticed, but as our FATHER makes many
a flower to bloom unseen in the lonely desert, so to do all that
we can do, as under His eye, though no other eye ever take note of
it?

It is our privilege to take our rest and recreation for the purpose of
pleasing Him; to lay aside our garments at night neatly (for He is in the
room, and watches over us while we sleep), to wash, to dress, to
smooth the hair, with His eye in view; and, in short, in all that
we are and in all that we do to use the full measure of ability
which GOD has given us to the glory of His holy Name?

Were we always so to live, how beautiful Christian life would become!

how much more worthy a witness we should bear to the world of Him whose
witnesses we are!
May the life we are living be characterised by the growth in grace
which will glorify GOD; and may tell-tale faces, and glad hearts,
and loving service be to each one of us as "a ribband of blue,"
reflecting the very hue of heaven, and reminding ourselves and one
another of our privileges to "remember all the commandments of the
LORD, and do them."

Blessed Prosperity Meditations On The First Psalm.

INTRODUCTORY.

There is a prosperity which is not blessed: it comes not from above
but from beneath, and it leads away from, not towards heaven.

This prosperity of the wicked is often a sore perplexity to the servants of
GOD; they need to be reminded of the exhortation, "Fret not thyself because
of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth
wicked devices to pass."

Many besides the Psalmist have been envious at the foolish when
seeing the prosperity of the wicked, and have been tempted to ask,
"Is there knowledge in the MOST HIGH?"

While Satan remains the GOD of this world, and has it is his power to prosper
his votaries, this source of perplexity will always continue to those who
do not enter into the sanctuary and consider the latter end of the
worldling.

Nor is it the godless only who are tempted by the offer of a prosperity
which comes from beneath. Our SAVIOUR Himself was tempted by the arch-enemy
in this way.

CHRIST was told that all that He desired to accomplish for the kingdoms
of this world might be effected by an easier path than the cross--a
little compromise with him who held the power and was able to bestow
the kingdoms, and all should be His own.

The lying wiles of the seducer were instantly rejected by our LORD;
not so ineffective are such wiles to many of His people; a little
policy rather than the course for which conscience pleads; a little
want of integrity in business dealings; a little compromise with
the ways of the world, followed by a prosperity which brings no
blessing, these prove often that the enemy's arts are still the
same.

But, thank GOD! There is a true prosperity which comes from Him and leads
towards Him.

It is not only consistent with perfect integrity and uncompromising holiness
of heart and life, but it cannot be attained without them, and its enjoyment
tends to deepen them.

This divine prosperity is GOD'S purpose for every believer, in all
that he undertakes; in things temporal and in things spiritual, in
all the relations and affairs of this life, as well as in all work
for CHRIST and for eternity, it is GOD'S will for each child of His
that "whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."

Yet many of His children evidently do not enjoy this uniform blessing;
some find failure rather than success the rule of their life: while
others, sometimes prospered and sometimes discouraged, live lives
of uncertainty, in which anxiety and even fear are not infrequent.

Shall we not each one at the outset ask, How is it with me? Is this blessed
prosperity my experience? Am I so led by the SPIRIT in my doings, and
so prospered by GOD in their issues, that as His witness I can bear testimony
to His faithfulness to this promise?

If it be not so with me, what is the reason?

Which of the necessary conditions have I failed to fulfil?

May our meditations on the First Psalm make these conditions more
clear to our minds, and may faith be enabled to claim definitely
all that is included in this wonderful promise!

THE NEGATIVE CONDITIONS OF BLESSING "Blessed is the man that walketh not
in the counsel of the ungodly."

More literally, O the blessings, the manifold happiness of the man whose
character is here described in the first and second verses of this Psalm!
He is happy in what he escapes or avoids, and happy and prospered in
what he undertakes.

The first characteristic given us is that he walks not in the counsel
of the ungodly, the wicked.

Notice, it does not merely say that he walks not in wicked counsel: a
man of GOD clearly would not do this; but what is said is that he "walketh
not in the counsel of the wicked."

Now the wicked have often much worldly wisdom, and become noted for their
prosperity and their prudence, but the child of GOD should always be on his
guard against their counsel; however good it may appear, it is full of
danger.

One of the principal characteristics of the wicked is that GOD is
not in all his thoughts; he sees everything from the standpoint of self,
or, at the highest, from the standpoint of humanity. His maxim, "Take care
of number one," would be very good if it were meant that GOD is
first, and should always be put first; but he means it not so: self
and not GOD is number one to the ungodly.

The wicked will often counsel to honesty, not on the ground that honesty
is pleasing to GOD, but that it is the best policy; if in any particular
business transaction a more profitable policy appears quite safe,
those who have simply been honest because it pays best, will be
very apt to cease to be so.

The child of GOD has no need of the counsel of the ungodly; if he love and
study GOD'S Word it will make him wiser than all such counsellors. If
he seek for and observe all the counsel of GOD, through the guidance
of the HOLY SPIRIT, he will not walk in darkness even as to worldly
things.

The directions of GOD'S Word may often seem strange and impolitic, but
in the measure in which he has faith to obey the directions he finds
in the Scripture, turning not to the right hand nor to the left,
will he make his way prosperous, will he find good success.

The history of the early Friends in America, who would not take a weapon
to protect themselves against the savage Indian tribes, shows how safe it
is to follow the Word of GOD and not to resist evil.

And their later experience in the recent Civil War, in which no one of them
lost his life, though exposed to the greatest dangers and hardships because
they would not fight, further confirms the wisdom as well as
blessedness of literally obeying the Scripture.

The eyes of the LORD still run to and fro throughout the whole earth to
show Himself strong in behalf of those who put their trust in Him
before the sons of men.

The enlightened believer has so much better counsel that he no more needs
than condescends to accept the counsel of the ungodly.

And, more than this, the wise child of GOD will carefully ascertain
the standpoint of a fellow-believer before he will value his counsel;
for he learns from Scripture and experience that Satan too infrequently
makes handles of the people of GOD, as, for instance, in Peter's
case.

Little did the astonished Peter know whence his exhortation to the LORD
to pity Himself came; "Get thee behind me, Satan," showed that our
LORD had traced this counsel, which did not seek first the Kingdom
of GOD, to its true source.

Alas, the counsel of worldly-minded Christians does far more harm than that
of the openly wicked. Whenever the supposed interests of self, or family,
or country, or even of church or mission come first, we may be quite sure
of the true source of that counsel; it is at least earthly or
sensual, if not devilish.

Further, the truly blessed man--
Standeth not in the way of sinners.

Birds of a feather flock together; the way of a sinner no more suits
a true believer than the way of the believer suits the sinner.

As a witness for his MASTER in the hope of saving the lost, he may go
to them; but he will not, like Lot, pitch his tent towards Sodom; lest he
be ensnared as Lot was, who only escaped himself, losing all those
he loved best, and all his possessions.

Ah, how many parents who have fluttered moth-like near the flame,
have seen their children destroyed by it, while they themselves
have not escaped unscathed!

How many churches and Christian institutions, in the attempt to
attract the unconverted by worldly inducements or amusements, have
themselves forfeited the blessing of GOD; and have so lost spiritual
power, that those whom they have thus attracted have been nothing
benefited!

Instead of seeing the dead quickened, a state of torpor and death has crept
over themselves.

There is no need of, nor room for, any other attraction than that
which CHRIST Himself gave, when He said, "I, if I be lifted up
...
will draw all men unto Me."

Our MASTER was ever "separate from sinners," and the HOLY SPIRIT speaks
unmistakably in 2 Cor. vi.:
"What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what
communion hath light with darkness?

... for ye are the temple of the living GOD; as GOD hath said, I will
dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their GOD, and they
shall be my people.

Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate ... and touch
not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a FATHER unto
you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the LORD Almighty."

"Nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."

"I hope not!" gasped Ruth, in real panic. "I'm not doing this for any
such purpose. Don't be singing my praises all the time, Helen. The girls
will get sick and tired to death of hearing about 'wonderful me.' We all
want to do something to help Mrs. Tellingham and the school. That's all
there is to it. Now, _do_ be sensible."

They were not long in taking the girls at large into their confidence.
When it was known that Ruth Fielding had actually written one scenario for
a film, which had been accepted, paid for, and would be produced,
naturally the enthusiasm over the idea of having a reproduction of school
life at Briarwood filmed, became much greater than it might otherwise have
been. As a whole, the girls of Briarwood Hall were in a mood to work
together for the fund.

"No misunderstandings," said Jennie Stone, firmly. "We don't want to make
the sort of mistake the rural constable did when he came along by the
riverside and saw a face floating on the water. 'Come out o' that!' he
says. 'You know there ain't no bathing allowed around here.' And the face
in the water answered: 'Excuse me, officer; I'm not bathing--I'm only
drowning!'

"We've all got to pull together," the plump girl continued, very much in
earnest. "No hanging back--no squabbling over little things. If Ruth
Fielding can write a picture play we must all do our prettiest in acting
in it. Why! I'd play understudy to a baby elephant in a circus for the
sake of helping build the new dormitory."

Already Mrs. Tellingham and the doctor had been informed by the girls'
executive committee of the sums both actually raised by the girls, and
promised, toward the dormitory fund. It had warranted the good lady's
signing contracts for the removal of the wreckage of the burned building,
at least. The way would soon be cleared for beginning work on a new
structure.

Offers of money came pouring in from the parents interested in the success
of Briarwood Hall; and some of the checks already received by Mrs.
Tellingham were for substantial sums. But this proposal of Ruth's for all
the girls to help in the increase of the fund, pleased Mrs. Tellingham
more than anything else.

She read Ruth's brief sketch of the plot she had originated for the school
play, and approved it. "The Heart of a Schoolgirl" was forthwith put into
shape to show Mr. Hammond when he came to Lumberton, that event being
expected daily.

About this time the girls of Briarwood Hall were so excited and interested
over the moving picture idea that they scarcely had time for their studies
and usual work.


CHAPTER XIV

AT MRS. SADOC SMITH'S

Mrs Tellingham, wise in the ways of girls, had foreseen the excitement and
disturbance in the placid current of Briarwood life, and made plans
following the fire to counteract the evil influences of just this
disturbance. The girls who hoped to graduate from the school in the coming
June must have more quiet--must have time to study and to think.

The younger girls, if they fell behind in their work, could make it up in
the coming terms. Not so Ruth Fielding and her friends, so the wise school
principal had distributed them, after the destruction of the West
Dormitory, in such manner that they would be free from the hurly-burly of
the general school life.

A few, like Mercy Curtis (who could not easily walk back and forth from
any outside lodging), Mrs. Tellingham kept in her own apartment. But the
greater number of the graduating class was distributed among neighbors
who--in most cases--were not averse to accepting good pay for rooms which
could only be let to summer boarders and were, at this time of year, never
occupied.

The Briarwood Hall preceptress allowed her girls to go only where she
could trust the land-ladies to have some oversight over their lodgers. And
the girls themselves were bound in honor to obey the rules of the school,
whether on the Briarwood premises or not.

Visiting among the outside scholars was forbidden, and the girls studying
for graduation had their hours more to themselves than they would have had
in the school.

Special chums were able to keep together in most instances. Ruth, Helen
and Ann Hicks went to live at Mrs. Sadoc Smith's; and there was room in
the huge front room on the second floor of her rambling old house, for
Mercy, too, had it been wise for the lame girl to lodge so far from the
school.

Mrs. Smith got the girls up in season in the morning to reach the dining
hall at Briarwood by breakfast-time; and she saw to it, likewise, that
their light went out at ten o'clock in the evening. Alas! you must
submit and be undone.

_La Nu._ Damn your false Art-- had he but lov'd me too, it had excus'd
the Malice of my Stars.

_Will._ Indeed, his Love is doubtful; for here-- I trace him in a
new pursuit-- which if you can this Night prevent, perhaps you fix
him.

_La Nu._ Hah, pursuing a new Mistress! there thou hast met the little
Resolution I had left, and dasht it into nothing-- but I have vow'd
Allegiance to my Interest-- Curse on my Stars, they cou'd not give
me Love where that might be advanc'd-- I'll hear no more.

[Gives him Money.

Enter Shift.

_Shift._ Sir, there are several Strangers arriv'd, who talk of the old Oracle.
How will you receive 'em?

_Will._ I've business now, and must be excus'd, a while.-- Thus far-- I'm
well; but I may tell my Tale so often o'er, till, like the Trick
of Love, I spoil the pleasure by the repetition.-- Now I'll uncase,
and see what Effects my Art has wrought on _La Nuche_, for she's
the promis'd Good, the Philosophick Treasure that terminates my
Toil and Industry.

Wait you here.
[Ex. _Will._
Enter _Ariadne_ in Mens Clothes, with _Lucia_ so drest, and other
Strangers.

_Aria._ How now, Seignior Operator, where's this renowned Man of Arts and
Sciences, this Don of Wonders?-- hah! may a Man have a Pistole's Worth
or two of his Tricks? will he shew, Seignior?

_Shift._ Whatever you dare see, Sir.

_Aria._ And I dare see the greatest Bug-bear he can conjure up, my
Mistress's Face in a Glass excepted.

_Shift._ That he can shew, Sir, but is now busied in weighty Affairs with
a Grandee.

_Aria._ Pox, must we wait the Leisure of formal Grandees and Statesmen-- ha,
who's this?-- the lovely Conqueress of my Heart, _La Nuche._ [Goes to
her, she is talking with _Aurel._
_La Nu._ What foolish thing art thou?

_Aria._ Nay, do not frown, nor fly; for if you do, I must arrest you, fair
one.

_La Nu._ At whose Suit, pray?

_Aria._ At Love's-- you have stol'n a Heart of mine, and us'd it
scurvily.

_La Nu._ By what marks do you know the Toy, that I may be no longer
troubled with it?

_Aria._ By a fresh Wound, which toucht by her that gave it bleeds
anew, a Heart all over kind and amorous.

_La Nu._ When was this pretty Robbery committed?

_Ana._ To day, most sacrilegiously, at Church, where you debauch'd
my Zeal; and when I wou'd have pray'd, your Eyes had put the Change
upon my Tongue, and made it utter Railings: Heav'n forgive ye!

_La Nu._ You are the gayest thing without a Heart, I ever saw.

_Aria._ I scorn to flinch for a bare Wound or two; nor is he routed that
has lost the day, he may again rally, renew the Fight, and
vanquish.

_La Nu._ You have a good opinion of that Beauty, which I find not so forcible,
nor that fond Prattle uttered with such Confidence.

_Aria._ But I have Quality and Fortune too.

_La Nu._ So had you need. I should have guest the first by your pertness;
for your saucy thing of Quality acts the Man as impudently at fourteen, as
another at thirty: nor is there any thing so hateful as to hear it
talk of Love, Women and Drinking; nay, to see it marry too at that
Age, and get itself a Play-fellow in its Son and Heir.

_Aria._ This Satyr on my Youth shall never put me out of countenance, or
make me think you wish me one day older; and egad, I'll warrant them that
tries me, shall find me ne'er an hour too young.

_La Nu._ You mistake my Humour, I hate the Person of a fair conceited
Boy.

Enter _Willmore_ drest, singing.

_Will._ _Vole, vole dans cette Cage, Petite Oyseau dans cet bocage._ --How
now, Fool, where's the Doctor?

_Shift._ A little busy, Sir.

_Will._ Call him, I am in haste, and come to cheapen the Price of
Monster.

_Shift._ As how, Sir?

_Will._ In an honourable way, I will lawfully marry one of 'em, and
have pitcht upon the Giant; I'll bid as fair as any Man.

_Shift._ No doubt but you will speed, Sir: please you, Sir, to walk in.

_Will._ I'll follow-- _Vole, vole dans cette Cage_, &c.

_Luc._ Why,'tis the Captain, Madam-- [Aside to _Aria._
_La Nu._ Hah-- marry-- harkye, Sir,-- a word, pray.
[As he is going out she pulls him.

_Will._ Your Servant, Madam, your Servant-- _Vole, vole_, &c.
[Puts his Hat off carelesly, and walks by, going out.

_Luc._ And to be marry'd, mark that.

_Aria._ Then there's one doubt over, I'm glad he is not married.

_La Nu._ Come back-- Death, I shall burst with Anger-- this Coldness
blows my Flame, which if once visible, makes him a Tyrant--
_Will._ Fool, what's a Clock, fool?

this noise hinders me from hearing it strike.
[Shakes his Pockets, and walks up and down.

_La Nu. _ A blessed sound, if no Hue and Cry pursue it.-- what-- you are
resolv'd then upon this notable Exploit?

_Will._ What Exploit, good Madam?

_La Nu._ Why, marrying of a Monster, and an ugly Monster.

_Will._ Yes faith, Child, here stands the bold Knight, that singly,
and unarm'd, designs to enter the List with _Thogogandiga_ the
Giant; a good Sword will defend a worse cause than an ugly Wife.

I know no danger worse than fighting for my Living, and I have don't
this dozen years for Bread.

_La Nu._ This is the common trick of all Rogues, when they have
done an ill thing to face it out.

_Will._ An ill thing-- your Pardon, Sweet-heart, compare it but to
Banishment, a frozen Sentry with brown George and _Spanish_ Pay;
and if it be not better to be Master of a Monster, than Slave to a
damn'd Commonwealth-- I submit-- and since my Fortune has thrown
this good in my way--
_La Nu._ You'll not be so ungrateful to refuse it; besides then you
may hope to sleep again, without dreaming of Famine, or the Sword,
two Plagues a Soldier of Fortune is subject to.

_Will._ Besides Cashiering, a third Plague.

_La Nu._ Still unconcern'd!-- you call me mercenary, but I would starve
e'er suffer my self to be possest by a thing of Horror.

_Will._ You lye, you would by any thing of Horror: yet these things of
Horror have Beauties too, Beauties thou canst not boast of, Beauties
that will not fade; Diamonds to supply the lustre of their Eyes,
and Gold the brightness of their Hair, a well-got Million to atone
for Shape, and Orient Pearls, more white, more plump and smooth,
than that fair Body Men so languish for, and thou hast set such
Price on.

_Aria._ I like not this so well, 'tis a trick to make her jealous.

_Will._ Their Hands too have their Beauties, whose very mark finds
credit and respect, their Bills are current o'er the Universe;
besides these, you shall see waiting at my Door, four Footmen, a
Velvet Coach, with Six _Flanders_ Beauties more: And are not these
most comely Virtues in a Soldier's Wife, in this most wicked peaceable
Age?

_Luc._ He's poor too, there's another comfort. [Aside.

_Aria._ The most incouraging one I have met with yet.

_Will._ Pox on't, I grow weary of this virtuous Poverty. There goes a gallant
Fellow, says one, but gives him not an Onion; the Women too, faith,
'tis a handsom Gentleman, but the Devil a Kiss he gets _gratis_.

_Aria._ Oh, how I long to undeceive him of that Error.

_La Nu._ He speaks not of me; sure he knows me not.

[Aside.

_Will._ --No, Child, Money speaks sense in a Language all Nations
understand, 'tis Beauty, Wit, Courage, Honour, and undisputable
Reason-- see the virtue of a Wager, that new philosophical way
lately found out of deciding all hard Questions-- _Socrates_, without
ready Money to lay down, must yield.

_Aria._ Well, I must have this gallant Fellow. [Aside.

_La Nu._ Sure he has forgot this trival thing.

_Will._ --Even thou-- who seest me dying unregarded, wou'd then be fond and
kind, and flatter me.
[_Soft tone._ By Heaven, I'll hate thee then; nay, I will marry to be rich
to hate thee: the worst of that, is but to suffer nine Days Wonderment. Is
not that better than an Age of Scorn from a proud faithless Beauty?

_La Nu._ Oh, there's Resentment left-- why, yes faith, such a Wedding would
give the Town diversion: we should have a lamentable Ditty made
on it, entitled, The Captain's Wedding, with the doleful Relation
of his being over-laid by an o'er-grown Monster.

_Will._ I'll warrant ye I escape that as sure as cuckolding; for I would
fain see that hardy Wight that dares attempt my Lady Bright, either
by Force or Flattery.

_La Nu._ So, then you intend to bed her?

_Will._ Yes faith, and beget a Race of Heroes, the Mother's Form
with all the Father's Qualities.

_La Nu._ Faith, such a Brood may prove a pretty Livelihood for a
poor decay'd Officer; you may chance to get a Patent to shew 'em
in _England_, that Nation of Change and Novelty.

_Will._ A provision old _Carlo_ cannot make for you against the
abandon'd day.

_La Nu._ He can supply the want of Issue a better way; and tho he be not
so fine a fellow as your self, he's a better Friend, he can keep a
Mistress: give me a Man can feed and clothe me, as well as hug and
all to bekiss me, and tho his Sword be not so good as yours, his
Bond's worth a thousand Captains.

This will not do, I'll try what Jealousy will do. [Aside.] Your Servant,
Captain-- your Hand, Sir.
[Takes _Ariadne_ by the Hand.

_Will._ Hah, what new Coxcomb's that-- hold, Sir-- [Takes her from him.

_Aria._ What would you, Sir, ought with this Lady?

_Will._ Yes, that which thy Youth will only let thee guess at-- this--
Child, is Man's Meat; there are other Toys for Children.
[Offers to lead her off.

_La Nu._ Oh insolent! and whither would'st thou lead me?

_Will._ Only out of harm's way, Child, here are pretty near Conveniences
within: the Doctor will be civil-- 'tis part of his Calling-- Your Servant,
Sir-- [Going off with her.

_Aria._ I must huff now, tho I may chance to be beaten-- come back--
or I have something here that will oblige ye to't.

[Laying his hand on his Sword.

_Will._ Yes faith, thou'rt a pretty Youth; but at this time I've more occasion
for a thing in Petticoats-- go home, and do not walk the Streets
so much; that tempting Face of thine will debauch the grave men of
business, and make the Magistrates lust after Wickedness.

_Aria._ You are a scurvy Fellow, Sir. [Going to draw.

_Will._ Keep in your Sword, for fear it cut your Fingers, Child.

_Aria._ So 'twill your Throat, Sir-- here's Company coming that
will part us, and I'll venture to draw.

[Draws, Will. draws.

Enter _Beaumond_.

_Beau._ Hold, hold-- hah, _Willmore_! thou Man of constant mischief,
what's the matter?

_La Nu._ _Beaumond_! undone!

_Aria._ --_Beaumond!_--
_Will._ Why, here's a young Spark will take my Lady Bright from me;
the unmanner'd Hot-spur would not have patience till I had finish'd
my small Affair with her.

[Puts up his Sword.

_Aria._ Death, he'll know me-- Sir, you see we are prevented.

[Draws him aside.
--or-- [Seems to talk to him, _Beau._ gazes on _La Nuche_, who has
pull'd down her Veil.

_Beau._ 'Tis she! Madam, this Veil's too thin to hide the perjur'd
Beauty underneath.

Oh, have I been searching thee, with all the diligence of impatient
Love, and am I thus rewarded, to find thee here incompass'd round
with Strangers, fighting, who first should take my right away?

-- Gods! take your Reason back, take all your Love; for easy Man's unworthy
of the Blessings.

_Will._ Harkye, _Harry_-- the-- Woman-- the almighty Whore-- thou
told'st me of to day.

_Beau._ Death, do'st thou mock my Grief-- unhand me strait, for tho
I cannot blame thee, I must hate thee.-- [Goes out.

_Will._ What the Devil ails he?

_Aria._ You will be sure to come.

_Will._ At night in the Piazza; I have an Assignation with a Woman,
that once dispatch'd, I will not fail ye, Sir.

_Luc._ And will you leave him with her?

_Aria._ Oh, yes, he'll be ne'er the worse for my use when he has done with
her.

[Ex. _Luc._ and _Aria._ _Will._ looks with scorn on _La Nuche_.

_Will._ Now you may go o'ertake him, lie with him-- and ruin him:
the Fool was made for such a Destiny-- if he escapes my Sword.

[He offers to go.

_La Nu._ I must prevent his visit to this Woman-- but dare not tell
him so.

[Aside.] --I would not have ye meet this angry Youth.

_Will._ Oh, you would preserve him for a farther use.

_La Nu._ Stay-- you must not fight-- by Heaven, I cannot see-- that
Bosom-- wounded.

[Turns and weeps.

_Will._ Hah! weep'st thou?

curse me when I refuse a faith to that obliging Language of thy Eyes-- Oh
give me one proof more, and after that, thou conquerest all my
Soul; Thy Eyes speak Love-- come, let us in, my Dear, e'er the
bright Fire allays that warms my Heart.

[Goes to lead her out.

_La Nu._ Your Love grows rude, and saucily demands it. [Flings away.

_Will._ Love knows no Ceremony, no respect when once approacht so near the
happy minute.

_La Nu._ What desperate easiness have you seen in me, or what
mistaken merit in your self, should make you so ridiculously vain,
to think I'd give myself to such a Wretch, one fal'n even to the
last degree of Poverty, whilst all the World is prostrate at my
Feet, whence I might chuse the Brave, the Great, the Rich?

[He stands spitefully gazing at her.

--Still as he fires, I find my Pride augment, and when he cools I burn.
[Aside.

_Will._ Death, thou'rt a-- vain, conceited, taudry Jilt, who wou'st draw
me in as Rooks their Cullies do, to make me venture all my stock
of Love, and then you turn me out despis'd and poor-- [Offers to go.

_La Nu._ You think you're gone now--
_Will._ Not all thy Arts nor Charms shall hold me longer.

_La Nu._ I must submit-- and can you part thus from me?-- [Pulls him.

_Will._ I can-- nay, by Heaven, I will not turn, nor look at thee.

No, when I do, or trust that faithless Tongue again-- may I be--
_La Nu._ Oh do not swear--

_Will._ Ever curst-- [Breaks from her, she holds him.

_La Nu._ You shall not go-- Plague of this needless Pride, [Aside.
--stay-- and I'll follow all the dictates of my Love.

_Will._ Oh never hope to flatter me to faith again.
[His back to her, she holding him.

_La Nu._ I must, I will; what wou'd you have me do?

_Will._ [turning softly to her.] Never-- deceive me more, it may
be fatal to wind me up to an impatient height, then dash my eager
Hopes.

[_Sighing._ Forgive my roughness-- and be kind, _La Nuche_, I know
thou wo't-- 
_La Nu._ Will you then be ever kind and true?

_Will._ Ask thy own Charms, and to confirm thee more, yield and
disarm me quite.

_La Nu._ Will you not marry then? for tho you never can be mine that way,
I cannot think that you should be another's.

_Will._ No more delays, by Heaven, 'twas but a trick.

_La Nu._ And will you never see that Woman neither, whom you're
this Night to visit?

_Will._ Damn all the rest of thy weak Sex, when thou look'st thus, and art
so soft and charming.

[Offers to lead her out.

_La Nu._ _Sancho_-- my Coach. [Turns in scorn.

_Will._ Take heed, what mean ye?

_La Nu._ Not to be pointed at by all the envying Women of the Town,
who'l laugh and cry, Is this the high-priz'd Lady, now fall'n so
low, to doat upon a Captain?

a poor disbanded Captain? defend me from that Infamy.

_Will._ Now all the Plagues-- but yet I will not curse thee, 'tis
lost on thee, for thou art destin'd damn'd.

[Going out.

_La Nu._ Whither so fast?

_Will._ Why,-- I am so indifferent grown, that I can tell thee now--
to a Woman, young, fair and honest; she'll be kind and thankful--
farewel, Jilt-- now should'st thou die for one sight more of me,
thou should'st not ha't; nay, should'st thou sacrifice all thou
hast couzen'd other Coxcombs of, to buy one single visit, I am so
proud, by Heaven, thou shouldst not have it-- To grieve thee more,
see here, insatiate Woman [Shews her a Purse or hands full of Gold]
the Charm that makes me lovely in thine Eyes: it had all been thine
hadst thou not basely bargain'd with me, now 'tis the Prize of some
well-meaning Whore, whose Modesty will trust my Generosity.

[Goes out.

_La Nu._ Now I cou'd rave, t'have lost an opportunity which industry nor
chance can give again-- when on the yielding point, a cursed fit of Pride
comes cross my Soul, and stops the kind Career-- I'll follow
him, yes I'll follow him, even to the Arms of her to whom he's
gone.

_Aur._ Madam, 'tis dark, and we may meet with Insolence.

_La Nu._ No matter: _Sancho_, let the Coach go home, and do you follow
me--
_Women may boast their Honour and their Pride, But Love soon lays
those feebler Powr's aside._ [Exeunt.

ACT IV.
SCENE I. _The Street, or Backside of the Piazza dark._
Enter _Willmore_ alone.
_Will._ A Pox upon this Woman that has jilted me, and I for being
a fond believing Puppy to be in earnest with so great a Devil. Where
be these Coxcombs too? this _Blunt_ and _Fetherfool_? when a Man
needs 'em not, they are plaguing him with their unseasonable Jests--
could I but light on them, I would be very drunk to night-- but
first I'll try my Fortune with this Woman-- let me see-- hereabouts
is the Door.
[Gropes about for the Door.
Enter _Beaumond_, follow'd by _La Nuche_, and _Sancho_.
_La Nu._ 'Tis he, I know it by his often and uneasy pauses--
_Beau._ And shall I home and sleep upon my injury, whilst this more
happy Rover takes my right away?-- no, damn me then for a cold
senseless Coward.
[Pauses and pulls out a Key.
_Will._ This Damsel, by the part o'th' Town she lives in, shou'd
be of Quality, and therefore can have no dishonest design on me,
it must be right down substantial Love, that's certain.
_Beau._ Yet I'll in and arm my self for the Encounter, for 'twill
be rough between us, tho we're Friends.
[Groping about, finds the Door.
_Will._ Oh, 'tis this I'm sure, because the Door is open.
_Beau._ Hah-- who's there?-- [_Beau._ advances to unlock the Door,
runs against _Will._ draws.She was able, with an untrammeled mind, to go on with
the actual work of writing the scenario.


CHAPTER XVI

THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG


Those were really strenuous days indeed for Ruth Fielding and her friends
at Briarwood Hall. The class that looked forward to graduating in June was
exceedingly busy.

Had Mrs. Tellingham not made an equitable arrangement in regard to Ruth's
English studies, allowing her credits on her writing, the girl of the Red
Mill would never have found time for the writing of the scenario which all
hoped would ultimately bring a large sum into the dormitory fund.

With faith in her pupil's ability as a writer for the screen, Mrs.
Tellingham had gone on with the work of clearing away the ruins of the
burned building, and had given out contracts for the construction of the
new dormitory on the site of the old one.

The sums already gathered from voluntary contributions paid the bills as
the work went along; but in "The Heart of a Schoolgirl" must lie the
earning power to carry the work to completion.

As each girl of the senior class had special work in English of an
original nature, Mrs. Tellingham announced that Ruth's scenario should
count as her special thesis.

"We will let Mr. Hammond judge it, my dear," the principal said to Ruth.
She was already proud of the girl's achievement in writing "Curiosity,"
for she had now read that first scenario. "If Mr. Elmy. Jordan; Angelica,

Ruth Fielding was a perfectly healthy girl, as well as an athletic one.
But in a time of stress like this the very healthiest person can easily
and quickly break down. "I feel as though I should fly!" is an expression
often heard from nervous and overwrought schoolgirls. Ruth wished that she
might fly--away from school and study and scenarios and sullen girls like
Amy Gregg.

One evening when she came back to Mrs. Sadoc Smith's with a strapful of
books to study before bedtime, Ruth saw Curly Smith by the shed door busy
with some fishing tackle. Ruth's pulses leaped. Fishing! She had not
thrown a hook into the water for months and months!

"Going fishing, Curly?" she said wistfully.

"Yep."

"Where are they biting now?"

"There's carp and bream under the old mill-dam up in Norman's Woods. I saw
'em jumping there to-day."

"Oh! when are you going?" gasped the girl, hungry for outdoor sport and
adventure.

"In the morning--before _you're_ up," said the boy, rather sullenly.

"I wager I'll be awake," said Ruth, sitting down beside him. "I wake
up--oh, just awfully early! and lie and think."

Curly looked at her. "That don't get you nothin'," he said.

"But I can't help it."

"Gran says you're overworked," Curly said. "Why don't you run away from
school if they make you work so hard? _I_ would. Our teacher's sick so
there isn't any session at the district school to-morrow."

"Oh, Curly! Play hooky?" gasped Ruth, clasping her hands.

"Yep. Only you girls haven't any pluck."

"If I played hooky would you let me go fishing with you to-morrow?" asked
Ruth, her eyes dancing.

"You haven't the sand," scoffed Curly.

"But can I go if I _dare_ run away?" urged Ruth.

"Yep," said the boy, but with rather a sour grin.

"What time are you going to start?"

"Four."

"If I'm not down in the kitchen by that time, throw some gravel up to the
window," commanded Ruth. "But don't break the window."

"Oh, shucks! you won't go when you see how dark and damp it is," declared
Curly.

When, just after four o'clock in the morning, Curly crept downstairs from
his shed chamber, knuckling his eyes to get the sleep out, there was a
light in the kitchen and Ruth was just pouring out two fragrant cups of
coffee which flanked a heaping plate of doughnuts.

"Old Scratch!" gasped Curly. "Gran will have our hides and hair! You're
not _going_, Ruth Fielding?"

"If you will let me," said Ruth, meekly.

"Well--if you want. But you'll get wet and dirty and mussy----"

Then he stopped. He saw that Ruth had on an old gymnasium suit, her rubber
boots lay on the chair, and a warm polo coat was at hand. She already wore
her tam-o-shanter.

"Huh! I see you're ready," Curly said. "You might as well go. But
remember, if you want to come home before afternoon, you'll have to find
your way back alone. I'm not going to be bothered by a girl's fantods."

"All right, Curly," said Ruth, cheerfully.

Curly put his face under the spigot, brushed his hair before the little
mirror in the corner, and was ready to sample Ruth's coffee.

"We want to hurry," he said, filling his pockets with the doughnuts,
"it'll be broad daylight before we know it, and then everybody we see will
want to come along. The other fellows aren't on to the old dam yet this
season. The fish are running early."

He brought forth a basket with tackle and bait, dug over night. Ruth
burdened herself with a big, square box, neatly wrapped and tied. Curly
eyed this askance.

"I s'pose you expect to tear your clo'es and want something to wear back
to town that's decent," he growled.

"Well, I want to look half way respectable," laughed Ruth, as they set
forth.

The damp smell of thawing earth greeted their nostrils as they left the
house. No plowing had been done, save in very warm corners; but the lush
buds on the trees and bushes, and the crocuses by the corner of the old
house, promised spring.

A clape called at them raucously as he rapped out his warning on a dead
limb beside the road. A rabbit rose from its form and shot away into the
dripping woods. The sun poked a jolly red face above the wooded ridge
before the two runaways left the beaten track and took a narrow woodpath
that would cut off about a mile of their walk.

chattered at them, and a blue jay hung about, squalling, evidently hoping
for crumbs from their lunch. Only there were no crumbs of Curly's frugal
bologna and crackers left.

When the sun was in mid-heaven the boy confessed to being as hungry as
ever, and tightened his belt. "Crackers don't stick to your ribs much," he
grumbled.

Ruth calmly began opening her box. Curly looked at her askance.

"You aren't figgering on going home _now_, are you?" he asked.

"Oh, no. I sha'n't go home till you do."

Then she produced from the box sandwiches, deviled eggs, a jelly roll, a
jar of peanut butter, crackers, olives, and some more of Mrs. Smith's good
doughnuts.

"Old Scratch!" Curly ejaculated. "You're the best fellow to go fishing
with, Ruth Fielding, that I ever saw. You can come to _my_ parties any
time you like."

They spent the whole day delightfully and, tired, scratched, and not a
little wind-burned, Ruth tramped home behind Curly in good season for
supper at Mrs. Sadoc Smith's.

She did not tell the boy that the whole outing had been arranged the night
before with his grandmother before Ruth herself went to bed. Curly
expected to be "called down," as he expressed it, by his grandmother when
they arrived home. To his amazement they were met cheerfully and ushered
in to a bounteous supper on which Mrs. Smith had expended no little
thought and time.

Curly was stricken almost dumb by his grandmother's generosity and
good-nature. After supper he whispered to Ruth:

"Say! you're a wonder, you are, Ruth Fielding. Never anybody got around
Gran the way you do, before. You're a wonder!"

Helen and Ann met Ruth in great excitement. "Where under the sun have you
been--and in that ragged old gym suit?" gasped Helen.

"You look as though your face was burnt. I believe you've been playing
hooky, Ruth Fielding!" cried Ann.

"Right the first time," sighed Ruth, happily. "Oh, I feel _so_ much
better. And I know I shall sleep like a brick."

"You mean, a railroad tie, don't you?" demanded Ann. "_That's_ a sleeper!"

"Of course we found your note, and we told Miss Brokaw. But she's got it
in for you just the same," said Helen, slangily. "And only guess!"

"Yes! Guess! Ruth! Fielding!" and Ann seized her and danced her about the
room. "You missed it by being absent to-day."

"Oh, don't! Never mind all this! I'm tired enough. I've walked _miles_,"
groaned Ruth. "What have I missed?"

"Mr. Hammond is in Lumberton. He came to see you about the scenario,"
Helen eagerly said.

Ruth sat down and clasped her hands, while her cheeks paled. "It's a
failure!" she whispered.


CHAPTER XIX

That was not so, however, and Helen and Ann soon blurted out the good
news:

"It's a great success!"

"He's going to bring up the company next week and make the pictures at the

The sound
that had disturbed them was repeated. Ruth was sure, now, that it was
somebody sobbing.

"Amy! Amy Gregg!" she called again.

"Pshaw!" murmured Ann. "It isn't Amy. She'd have been out of here in a
hurry when we shouted for her before."

Ruth was not so sure of that. They came to a break in the flooring. Once
there had been steps here leading down into the cellar of the mill, but
the steps had rotted away.

"Amy!" called Ruth again. She knelt and held the lantern as far down the
well as she could reach. The sound of sobbing had ceased.

"Amy, _dear_!" cried Ruth. "It's Ruth and Ann, And Curly is with us. Do
answer if you hear me!"

There was a murmur from below. Ann cried out in alarm, but Curly
exclaimed: "I believe that's Amy, Ruth! She must be hurt--the silly thing.
She's tumbled down this old well."

"How will we get to her?" cried Ruth. "Amy! how did you get down there?
Are you hurt, Amy?"

"Go away!" said a faint voice from below.

"Old Scratch! Isn't that just like her?" groaned Curly. "She was hiding
from us."

"Here," said Ruth, drawing up the lantern and setting it on the floor. "It
can't be very deep. I'm going to drop down there, Curly, and then you pass
down the lantern to me."

"You'll break your neck, Ruth!" cried Ann.

"No. I'm not going to risk my neck at all," Ruth calmly affirmed.

She set the lantern on the broken floor and swung herself down into the
black hole. She hung by her hands and her feet did not touch the bottom.
Suddenly she felt a qualm of terror. Perhaps the cellar was a good deal
deeper than she had supposed!

She could not raise herself up again, and she almost feared to drop. "Let
down the light, Curly!" she whispered.


CHAPTER XXII

DISASTER THREATENS


Before Curly could comply with Ruth's whispered request, her fingers
slipped on the edge of the flooring. "Oh!" she cried out, and--dropped as
much as three inches!

"Goodness me, Ruth!" gasped Ann Hicks. "Are you killed?"

"No--o. But I might as well have been as to be scared to death," declared
the girl of the Red Mill. "I never thought the cellar was so shallow."

There was a rustling near by. Ruth thought of rats and almost screamed
aloud. "Give me the lantern--quick!" she called up to Curly Smith.

"Here you are," said that youth. "And if Amy is down there she ought to be
ashamed of herself--making us so much trouble."

Amy was there, as Ruth saw almost immediately when she could throw the
radiance of the lantern about her. But Ruth did not feel like scolding the
younger girl.

Amy had crept away into a corner. Her movements made the rustling Ruth
had heard. She hid her face against her arm and sobbed with abandonment.
Her dress was torn and muddy, her shoes showed that she had waded in mire.
She had lost her hat and her flaxen hair was a tangle of briers and green
burrs.

"My _dear_!" cried Ruth, kneeling down beside her. "What does it mean? Why
did you come here? Oh, you're sick!"

A single glance at the flushed face and neck of the smaller girl, and a
tentative touch upon her wrist, assured Ruth of that last fact. Amy seemed
burning up with fever. Ruth had never seen a case of scarlet fever, but
she feared that might be Amy's trouble.

"How long have you been here?" she asked Amy.

"Si--since--since it got dark," choked the girl.

"Is your throat sore?" asked Ruth, anxiously.

"Yes, it is; aw--awful sore."

"And you're feverish," said Ruth.

"I--I'm aw--all shivery, too," wept Amy Gregg, quite given up to misery
now.

Ruth was confident that the smaller girl had developed the fever that she
feared. Chill, fever, sore throat, and all, made the diagnosis seem quite
reasonable.

"How did you get into this cellar?" she asked Amy.

"There's a hole in the underpinning over yonder," said the culprit.

"Come on, then; we'll get out that way. Can you walk?"

"Oh--oh--yes," choked Amy.

She proved this by immediately starting out of the cellar. Ruth lit the
way with the lantern.

"Hi!" shouted Curly Smith, "where are you going with that light?"

"Come back to the door," commanded Ruth's muffled voice in the cellar.
"You can find your way all right."

"What do you know about that?" demanded Ann. "Leaves us in the lurch for
that miserable child, who ought to be walloped."

"Oh, Ann, don't say that!" cried Ruth, as she and the sick girl appeared
at the mill door. All. II._A Chamber in the first gallant Fellow that has

"I had the happiness," stated Mr. Farrington, "of being present when the
censors saw the first run of your eminently successful picture, 'The Heart
of a Schoolgirl,' Miss Fielding, and through a mutual friend I learned
where you were to be found. I may say that from your appearance on the
screen I was enabled to recognize you just now."

Ruth said nothing, but waited for him to explain. There really did not
seem to be anything she could say.

"I see in that film, Miss Fielding," pursued Mr. Farrington, "the promise
of better work--in time, of course, in time. You are young yet. I believe
you attend this boarding school?"

"Yes," said Ruth, simply.

"From the maturity of your treatment of the scenario I fancied you might
be a teacher here at Briarwood," pursued the man, smirking. This is a
rare plant in Europe, growing on old sacks, matting, carpets, and similar
refuse. It is generally found in cellars. I think it is not
known on wood nor recorded in the United States.

It resembles carbonized horse hair and was called "horse hair usnea" by old
Dillenius.

Our photograph of the specimen at Kew will give a good idea of it, although
from the account it grows erect, and is not matted. Both Bulliard and
Sowerby gave characteristic figures, both from plants growing in
cellars, on old mats.

It has had a great number of names, and is recorded in Saccardo as Xylaria
hippotrichoides, the specific name proposed by Sowerby and used by Persoon.
Some very recent juggler, I have forgotten who, dug up the old
name setosa, which I adopt as being less cumbersome.

Occasionally these jugglers do propose some improvement in names, and I
believe in encouraging them, when their wonderful date dictionary
discoveries are really better names. Saccardo gives the following synonyms:
Sphaeria hippotrichoides, Ceratonema hippotrichoides, Hypoxylon
loculiferum, Rhizomorpha tuberculosa, Cryptothamnium usneaeforme,
Rhizomorpha setiformis, Chaenocarpus setosus, Chaenocarpus Simonini.

The date expert must have had quite a job.

Xylaria adnata as described by Fuckel (Rhizomorpha adnata), and unknown
to me, is evidently very similar to the preceding plant, but grows
closely adnate to rotten beech wood.

Xylaria fragilis (Rhizomorpha fragilis) is imperfectly known from old records
in Europe. It is probably same as above.

Xylaria hispidissima (Rhizomorpha hispidissima) from East Indies is known
only from old description. It is an evident Xylaria and seems to be
same as recently collected, adventitious in a hot house in Hungary,
and distributed as Xylaria hungarica.

Xylaria annulata, described in 1820 from West Indies as Thamnomyces
annulatus and unknown otherwise, reads like Thamnomyces chardalis,
but the branches of the latter are not known to be "annulated under
a lens."

[Illustration: #Fig. 854.#]
XYLARIA ANNULIPES, described and figured by Montagne as Thamnomyces
annulipes from Brazil, is same as since named Xylaria marasmoides (Fig.
854) by Berkeley. Berkeley does not mention the rings on the stem as
shown so plainly in Montagne's enlarged figure, nor can I note
them with a lens on my photograph of Berkeley's or Montagne's types.

Spegazzini refers marasmoides as a synonym for annulipes, no doubt
correctly.

Theissen refers it as a synonym for Xylaria aristata, an evident error.
Xylaria vermiculus, recently published from Brazil by Sydow, as "Saccardo
n. sp. in litt.," is, both from description and photograph, evidently
the same as Xylaria annulipes.

[Illustration: #Fig. 855.#]
XYLARIA MELANURA (Fig. 855), West Indies, described as Chaenocarpus melanurus
and compiled in Saccardo in section Thamnomyces, is evidently same
as Xylaria gracillima in sense of Berkeley and Montagne, but not I
believe as to Fries.

We present a photograph made from Léveillé's cotype.

Xylaria axillaris was not compiled in Thamnomyces in Saccardo, but is
evidently a very similar if not the same plant as Xylaria setosa, and
is only known from Currey's original account from Africa. It is about a
half inch high, with filiform stem, and few, superficial perithecia.

Spores are given as 25 to 32 mic., which are much larger than those of
setosa.

Xylaria patagonica as named by Crombie as Thamnomyces and compiled in
Saccardo, Vol. 9, was based on Dillenius' old (1741) figure t. 13,
f. 11, from Patagonia, which, as far as the figure goes, could be
Xylaria setosa.

Of course, nothing as known about it.

"Oh, dear me!" gasped Ruth. "I'm not sure I want to be so publicly known."

"Nonsense!" cried the man, in amazement. "Why! in publicity is the breath
of life. Without it, we faint--we die--we, worse--we _vegetate_!"

"I--I guess I don't mind vegetating--a--a little," stammered Ruth, weakly.

At that moment Mary Pease came racing down the walk. She waved a letter in
her hand and was calling Ruth's name.

"Oh, Ruthie Fielding!" she called, when she saw Ruth with the man. [ Aside

    They went to
the matineé, and the center of enthusiasm was in the seats in the body of
the house reserved for the Briarwood girls.

The house was well filled at this first showing of the picture in
Lumberton, and more than the girls themselves were enthusiastic over it.
_Clar._ Why, is it possible _Marcel_ should be false?

_Dorm._ _Marcel!

_ No, no, Sweet-heart, he is that Man of a thousand.

_Clar._ But if he should, you have undone me, by telling me so many pretty
things of him.

_Dorm._ Still you question my Ability, which by no means I can indure; get
you in I say.

_Clar._ Do not speak so loud, you will wake my Mother.

_Dorm._ At your Instructions again; do you question my Conduct and Management
of this Affair?

    Go watch for him
     your self:
     I'll have no more to
     do with you
     back nor
     edge.
     [Offers to go.
     
     _Clar._ Will you
     be so barbarous to leave me to my self, after having made it your
Business this three Months to sollicit a Heart which was but too
ready to yield before; after having sworn to me how honourable all
his Intents were; nay, made me write to him to come to night?

And now when I have done this, and am all trembling with fear and
shame (and yet an infinite Desire to see him too) [Sighs] thou wilt
abandon me:
go, when such as you oblige, 'tis but to be insolent with the more
freedom.

_Dorm._ What, you are angry I'll warrant.

[Smiles.

_Clar._ I will punish my self to pay thee back, and will not see _Marcel_.

_Dorm._ What a pettish Fool is a Maid in love at fifteen! how
unmanageable!

But I'll forgive all-- go get you in, I'll watch for your Lover; I would
not have you disoblige a Man of his Pretensions and Quality for all the
World.
[_Clarinda_ goes in.

Enter _Alonzo_ below.

_Alon._ Now do I want _Lovis_ extremely, to consult with him about
this Business: For I am afraid the Devil, or Love, or both are so
great with me, that I must marry this fair Inchantress, which is
very unlucky; but, since _Ambrosio_ and _Marcel_ refuse to see me,
I hold my self no longer ingag'd in Honour to _Hippolyta_.

_Dorm._ [above.] Whist, whist, Sir, Sir.

_Alon._ Who's there?

_Dorm._ 'Tis I, your Servant, Sir; oh you are a fine Spark, are you not,
to make so fair a Creature wait so long for you? there, there's the Key,
open the Door softly and come in.
[Throws him down a Key in a Handkerchief.

_Alon._ What's this? But I'll ask no Questions, so fair a Creature, said
she? Now if 'twere to save my Life cannot I forbear, I must go in:
Shou'd _Euphemia_ know this, she would call it Levity and Inconstancy;
but I plead Necessity, and will be judg'd by the amorous Men, and
not the jealous Women: For certain this Lady, whoe'er she be, designs
me a more speedy Favour than I can hope from _Euphemia_, and on
easier Terms too.

This is the Door that must conduct to the languishing _Venus_.
[Opens the Door and goes in, leaving it unshut.

Enter _Marcel_ with his Sword drawn.

_Mar._ Thus far I have pursu'd the Fugitives, Who by the help of
hasty Fear and Night, Are got beyond my Power; unlucky Accident!

Had I but kill'd _Antonio_, or _Hippolyta_, Either had made my Shame
supportable.

But tho I have mist the Pleasure of Revenge, I will not that of Love.
One Look from fair _Clarinda_ will appease The Madness which this
Disappointment rais'd.

[Walks looking towards the Window.
None appears yet: _Dormida_ was to throw me down the Key. The Door
is open, left so to give me entrance.
[Goes to the Door.
SCENE IV. _Changes to a dark Hall._
Discovers _Alonzo_ groping about in the Hall.
_Alon._ Now am I in a worse Condition than before, can neither
advance nor retreat: I do not like this groping alone in the Dark
thus.
Whereabouts am I?First she was
alarmed, for she confessed to a fear of automobiles. But when she felt the
huge machine which carried them so swiftly over the roads running so
smoothly, Aunt Alvirah became a convert to the new method of locomotion.

At the hotel where they halted for the night, there were more wonders.
Aunt Alvirah's knowledge of modern conveniences was from reading only. She
had never before been nearer to a telephone than to look up at the wires
that were strung from post to post before the Red Mill. Modern plumbing,
an elevator, heating by steam, and many other improvements, were like a
sealed book to her.

She disliked to be waited upon and whispered to Mrs. Murchiston:

"That air black man a-standin' behind my chair at dinner sort o' makes me
narvous. I'm expectin' of him to grab my plate away before I'm done
eatin'."

The day set for the graduation exercises at Briarwood Hall was as lovely a
June day as was ever seen. _Crom._ Thou ly'st, false Strumpet, I scorn to
shed a Tear, For ought that thou canst do or say to me; I've too
much of my Husband's Spirit in me.
Oh, my dear _Richard_, hadst thou had a Grain on't, Thou and thy Mother ne'er
had fall'n to this.

_Gil._ His Father sure was seeking of the Lard when he was got.

Enter L. _Fleetwood_, her Train born up.

_Crom._ Where is this perjur'd Slave, thy Wittal Lord?

Dares he not shew his Face, his guilty Face, Before the Person he has
thus betray'd?

_L. Fleet._ Madam, I hope you mistake my honour'd Lord _Lambert_,
I believe he designs the Throne for my dear Lord.

_Crom._ Fond Girl, because he has the Art of fawning, Dissembling to the
height, can sooth and smile, Profess, and sometimes weep:-- No, he'll betray
him, as he did thy Brother; _Richard_ the Fourth was thus deluded by him.

No, let him swear and promise what he will, They are but steps to
his own ambitious End; And only makes the Fool, thy credulous
Husband, A silly deluded Property.

Enter _Fleetwood_.

_Fleet._ My honour'd Mother, I am glad to find you here; I hope we
shall reconcile things between ye. Verily we should live in Brotherly
Love together; come, ingeniously, you shall be Friends, my Lady
Mother.

_Crom._ Curse on th' occasion of thy being a Kin to me.

_Fleet._ Why, an please ye, forsooth, Madam?

_Crom._ My Daughter had a Husband, Worthy the Title of my Son-in-Law;
_Ireton_, my best of Sons: he'd Wit and Courage, And with his
Counsels, rais'd our House to Honours, Which thy impolitick Easiness
pulls down:
And whilst you should be gaining Crowns and Kingdoms, Art poorly
couzening of the World with fruitless Prayers.

_Fleet._ Nay, I'll warrant you, Madam, when there is any gadly Mischief
to be done, I am as forward as the best; but 'tis good to take the Lard
along with us in every thing. I profess ingeniously, as I am an honest Man,
verily-- ne'er stir-- I shall act as becomes a good Christian.

_Crom._ A good Coxcomb.
Do'st thou not see her reverend Highness there, That Minion now assumes
that glorious Title I once, and my Son _Richard's_ Wife enjoy'd,
Whilst I am call'd the Night-mare of the Commonwealth?

But wou'd I were, I'd so hag-ride the perjur'd Slaves, Who took so many
Oaths of true Allegiance To my great Husband first, then to _Richard_--
Who, whilst they reign'd, were most illustrious, Most high and
mighty Princes; whilst fawning Poets Write Panegyricks on 'em; and
yet no sooner was The wondrous Hero dead, but all his glorious
Titles fell to Monster of Mankind, Murderer Of Piety, Traytor to
Heaven and Goodness.

_Fleet._ Who calls him so? Pray take their Names down: I profess ingeniously,
forsooth, Madam, verily I'll order 'em, as I am here I will.

_Crom._ Thou, alas! they scorn so poor a thing as thou.

_Fleet._ Do they ingeniously? I'll be even with 'em, forsooth, Mother, as
I am here I will, and there's an end on't.

_Crom._ I wou'd there were an end of our Disgrace and Shame, Which is but
just begun, I fear.
What will become of that fair Monument Thy careful Father did erect for
thee, [To L.

_Fleetwood_.
Yet whilst he liv'd, next to thy Husband _Ireton_, Lest none shou'd
do it for thee after he were dead; The Malice of proud _Lambert_
will destroy all.

_Fleet._ I profess, Madam, you mistake my good Lord _Lambert_, he's
an honest Man, and fears the Lard; he tells me I am to be the Man;
verily he does, after all's done.

_Cram._ Yes, after all's done, thou art the Man to be pointed at.

_Fleet._ Nay, ingeniously, I scorn the Words, so I do: I know the great
Work of Salvation to the Nation is to be wrought by me, verily.

_Crom._ Do, cant on, till Heaven drop Kingdoms in thy Mouth: Dull,
silly Sot, thou Ruin of our Interest; thou fond, incorrigible, easy
Fool.

Enter _Page_.

_Page._ My Lord, the Committee of Safety waits your coming.

_Fleet._ Why, law you now, forsooth-- I profess verily, you are
ingeniously the hardest of Belief-- tell the Honourable Lords I'm
coming: Go, Lady-mother, go home with my Wife; and verily you'll
see things go to your wish-- I must to Coach.
_L. Fleet._ Madam, your humble Servant. [To La. _Lam._
_Fleet._ Honour'd Lady, I kiss your Hands.
[Exeunt _Crom._ _Fleet_, and L. _Fleet._ 
Enter _Loveless_.
_Lov._ Was this the thing that is to be Protector?
This little sniveling Fellow rule three Kingdoms?"I didn't see your father or Tom or Mrs. Murchiston," Ruth said, as she
and Helen walked across the campus.

"They are here, just the same," said Helen, laughing.

"Where?"
