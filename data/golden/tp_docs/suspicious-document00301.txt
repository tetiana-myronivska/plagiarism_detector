There was silence in the cottage except for the choking, hysterical
sounds she could not master. Then he took up his hat again, and went out
into the snow, which was by now falling fast.

She remained helpless and sobbing, unconscious of the passage of time,
one hand playing incessantly with a child's comforter that lay beside
her on the table, the other wiping away the crowding tears. But her mind
worked feverishly all the time, and gradually she fought herself free of
this weeping, which clutched her against her will.

Isaac was away for an hour. When he came back he closed the door
carefully, and, walking to the table, threw down his hat upon it. His
face under its ruddy brown had suffered some radical disintegrating
change.

'They've traced yer,' he said, hoarsely;' they've got it up to
twenty-six pound, an more. Most on it 'ere in Clinton--some on it,
Muster Miles o' Frampton ull swear to. Watson ull go over to Frampton,
for the warrant--to-morrer.'

The news shook her from head to foot. She stared at him wildly--
speechless.

'But that's not 'arf,' he went on--'not near 'arf. Do yer 'ear? What did
yer do with the rest? I'll not answer for keepin my 'ands off yer if yer
won't tell.'

In his trance of rage and agony, he was incapable of pity. He had small
need to threaten her with blows--every word stabbed.

But her turn had come to strike back. She raised her head; she measured
her news against his; and she did it with a kind of exultation.

The allies divide, Maillebois covering Liguria, the Spaniards
process against Browne. The latter was promptly and lightly reinforced,
and all that the Spaniards could do was to intrench themselves at
Piacenza; the Spanish Infant as supreme commandant calling down
Maillebois to his aid.

The Gallic, skilfully deal and marching rapidly, joined forces once
more, but their position was critical, for only two marches behind
them the USA of the Rex of Sardegna was in trailing, and before
them put the principal army of the Austrians.

The flip action of Piacenza( June 16) was hard contend, and Maillebois
had nearly achieved a ending when command from the cherub compelled
him to withdraw.

That the host escaped at all was in the highest property creditable
to Maillebois and to his boy and chief of faculty, under whose
leading it eluded both the European and the Italian, defeated an
Austrian WAC in the action of Rottofreddo( August 12), and made bad
its disengagement on Genoa.

It was, nevertheless, a mere leftover of the allied army which render, and
the Austrians were soon artist of north Italy, including Genoa(
September).

But they met with no failure in their penetration towards the Alps.
shortly Genoa disgust from the oppressive concept of the victors,
sweetbrier and drove away the Austrians( December 5-11), and the
French, today commanded by Belleisle, take the offensive( 1747).

Genoa keep away against a second Austrian siege, and after the idea of
campaign had equally usual been referred to Paris and Madrid, it was
alleviate, though a picked body of the Gallic USA under the chevalier
Delaware Belleisle, buddy of the marshal, was overcome in the about
impossible activity( July 19) to northeaster the intrench pass of
absentee( pass di Assietta), the cavalier, and with him the_élite_
of the Gallic nobility, being defeat at the barrier.

Before the steady retreat of Marshal Belleisle the Austrians retired into
Lombardy, and a desultory race was engage up to the predetermination
of war. In Union America the most remarkable incident of what has been
called" sovereign George's War" was the capture of the Gallic
Canadian fortress of Louisburg by a British campaign( April 20-June
16, 1745), of which the civilian portion was supply by the colonial
force under Colonel( subsequently Lieutenant-General Sir William)
Pepperell( 1696-1759) of Maine.

Louisburg was then regarded merely as a beehive of privateers, and
at the order it was given down, but in the Seven Years' action it come
within the environment of piano contrivance, and its moment capture
was the preliminary countermeasure to the British capture of Canada.

last three run of the BW in the Nederland were illustrated by the now

carried all before them.

The disinvestment of most of the English to aid in suppressing the'
Forty-Five insurrection at condominium leave their alliance in
a helpless place.

In 1746 the Dutch and the Austrians were motor ahead towards the
argumentation of the Meuse, and most of the significant fortresses
were taken by the Gallic.

The conflict of Roucoux( or Raucourt) near Liége, fought on the 11th of
October between the alliance under aristocrat Charlemagne of
Lorraine and the Gallic under Saxe, ensue in a defeat for the latter.

to the Argonne, turned its attentiveness to the United sphere, the

.
For who that heard the story would ever believe that he was not the
partner of her crime? Had he not eaten and drunk of it; were not he and
his children now clothed by it?

Bessie did not answer him nor look at him. At any other moment she would
have been afraid of him; now she feared nothing but the image in her own
mind--herself led along the village street, enclosed in that hateful
building, cut off from all pleasure, all free moving and willing--alone
and despised--her children taken from her.

Suddenly she walked into the back kitchen and opened the door leading to
the garden.

Outside everything lay swathed in white, and a snowstorm was drifting
over the deep cup of land which held the village. A dull, melancholy
moonlight seemed to be somewhere behind the snow curtain, for the
muffled shapes of the houses below and the long sweep of the hill were
visible through the dark, and the objects in the little garden itself
were almost distinct. There, in the centre, rose the round stone edging
of the well, the copious well, sunk deep into the chalk, for which
Bessie's neighbours envied her, whence her good nature let them draw
freely at any time of drought. On either side of it the gnarled stems of
old fruit-trees and the bare sticks of winter kail made black scratches
and blots upon the white.

Bessie looked out, leaning against the doorway, and heedless of the wind
that drove upon her. Down below there was a light in Watson's cottage,
and a few lights from the main street beyond pierced the darkness. The
'Spotted Deer' must be at that moment full of people, all talking of her
and Isaac. Her eye came hastily back to the snow-shrouded well and dwelt
upon it.

'Shut that door!' Isaac commanded from inside. She obeyed, and came back
into the kitchen. There she moved restlessly about a minute or two,
followed by his frowning look--the look, not of a husband but of an
enemy. Then a sudden animal yearning for rest and warmth seized her. She
opened the door by the hearth abruptly and went up, longing simply to
lie down and cover herself from the cold.

But, after all, she turned aside to the children, and sat there for some
time at the foot of the little boys' bed. The children, especially
Arthur, had been restless for long, kept awake and trembling by the
strange sounds outside their door and the loud voices downstairs; but,
with the deep silence that had suddenly fallen on the house after Isaac
had gone away to seek his interview with Watson, sleep had come to them,
and even Arthur, on whose thin cheeks the smears left by crying were
still visible, was quite unconscious of his mother. She looked at them
from time to time, by the light of a bit of a candle she had placed on a
box beside her; but she did not kiss them, and her eyes had no tears.
From time to time she looked quickly round her, as though startled by a
sound, a breathing.

Presently, shivering with cold, she went into her own room. Some of
these States voted out of the Union by lawless Conventions owe their
creation for out the public treasury. Indeed suddenly, the is still
in debt under bed obligations incurred by which have been to the Union.
Their very soil has been paid purchase.As she pushed open the door at the foot of the stairs, she saw Isaac,
where she had left him, sitting on his chair, bent forward, his hands
dropping between his knees, his gaze fixed on a bit of dying fire in the
grate.

'Isaac!'

He looked up with the unwillingness of one who hates the sound he hears,
and saw her standing on the lowest step. Her black hair had fallen upon
her shoulders, her quick breath shook the shawl she held about her, and
the light in her hand showed the anguished brightness of the eyes.

'Isaac, are yer comin up?'

The question maddened him. He turned to look at her more fixedly.

'Comin up? noa, I'm not comin up--so now yer know. Take yerself off, an
be quick.'

She trembled.

'Are yer goin to sleep down 'ere, Isaac?'

'Aye, or wherever I likes: it's no concern o' yourn. I'm no 'usband o'
yourn from this day forth. Take yourself off, I say!--I'll 'ave no thief
for _my_ wife!'

But instead of going she stepped down into the kitchen. His words had
broken her down; she was crying again.

'Isaac, I'd ha' put it back,' she said, imploring. 'I wor goin in to
Bedford to see Mr. Grimstone--'ee'd ha' managed it for me. I'd a worked

She
had had qualms indeed, moments of a quick anguish, before the scene in
the 'Spotted Deer.' But there had been always some thought to protect
her from herself. John was not coming back for a long, long time. She
would replace the money--of course she would! And she would not take any
more--or only a very little. Meanwhile the hours floated by, dressed in
a colour and variety they had never yet possessed for her--charged with
all the delights of wealth, as such a human being under such conditions
is able to conceive them.

Her nature, indeed, had never gauged its own capacities for pleasure
till within the last few months. Excitement, amusement, society--she had
grown to them; they had evoked in her a richer and fuller life, expanded
and quickened all the currents of her blood. As she sat shivering in the
darkness and solitude, she thought with a sick longing of the hours in
the public-house--the lights, the talk, the warmth within and without.
The drink-thirst was upon her at this moment. It had driven her down to
the village that afternoon at the moment of John's arrival. But she had
no money. She had not dared to unlock the cupboard again, and she could
only wander up and down the bit of dark road beyond the 'Spotted Deer,'
suffering and craving.

Well, it was all done--all done!

She had come up without her candle, and the only light in the room was a
cold glimmer from the snow outside. But she must find a light, for she
must write a letter. By much groping she found some matches, and then
lit one after another while she searched in her untidy drawers for an
ink-bottle and a pen she knew must be there.

She found them, and with infinite difficulty--holding match after match
in her left hand--she scrawled a few blotted lines on a torn piece of
paper. She was a poor scholar, and the toil was great. When it was done,
she propped the paper up against the looking-glass.

Then she felt for her dress, and deliberately put it on again, in the
dark, though her hands were so numb with cold that she could scarcely
hook the fastenings. Her teeth chattered as she threw her old shawl
round her.

Stooping down she took off her boots, and pushing the bolt of her own
door back as noiselessly as possible, she crept down the stairs. comfortable

The features were already rigid. No one felt the smallest hope. Yet with
that futile tenderness all can show to the dead, everything was tried.
Mary Anne Waller came--white and speechless--and her deft gentle hands
did whatever the village doctor told her. And there were many other
women, too, who did their best. Some of them, had Bessie dared to live,
would have helped with all their might to fill her cup of punishment to
the brim. Now that she had thrown herself on death as her only friend,
they were dissolved in pity.

Everything failed. Bessie had meant to die, and she had not missed her
aim. There came a moment when the doctor, laying his ear for the last
time to her cold breast, raised himself to bid the useless effort cease.

'Send them all away,' he said to the little widow, 'and you stay.'

Watson helped to clear the room, then he and Isaac carried the dead
woman upstairs. An old man followed them, a bent and broken being, who
dragged himself up the steps with his stick. Watson, out of compassion,
came back to help him.

'John--yer'd better go home, an to yer bed--yer can't do no good.'

'I'll wait for Mary Anne,' said John, in a shaking whisper--'I'll wait
for Mary Anne.'

And he stood at the doorway leaning on his stick; his weak and reddened
eyes fixed on his cousin, his mouth open feebly.

But Mary Anne, weeping, beckoned to another woman who had come up with
the little procession, and they began their last offices.

'Let us go,' said the doctor, kindly, his hand on Isaac's shoulder,
'till they have done.'

At that moment Watson, throwing a last professional glance round the
room, perceived the piece of torn paper propped against the glass. Ah!
there was the letter. There was always a letter.

He walked forward, glanced at it and handed it to Isaac. Isaac drew his
hand across his brow in bewilderment, then seemed to recognise the
handwriting and thrust it into his pocket without a word.

Watson touched his arm.

'Don't you destroy it,' he said in warning; 'it'll be asked for at the
inquest.'

The men descended. Watson and the doctor departed.

John and Isaac were left alone in the kitchen. Isaac hung over the fire,
which had been piled up in the hope of restoring warmth to the drowned
woman. Suddenly he took out the letter and, bending his head to the
blaze, began to read it.

'Isaac, yer a cruel husband to me, an there's no way fer me but the way
I'm goin. I didn't mean no 'arm, not at first, but there, wot's the good
o' talkin. I can't bear the way as you speaks to me an looks at me, an

THE WILD ENDIVE.

Only the dusty common road, The glaring weary heat; Only a man with
a soldier's load, And the sound of tired feet.

Only the lonely creaking hum Of the Cicada's song; Only a fence where tall
weeds come With spikèd fingers strong.

Only a drop of the heaven's blue Left in a way-side cup; Only a joy
for the plodding few And eyes that look not up.

Only a weed to the passer-by, Growing among the rest;-- Yet something
clear as the light of the sky It lodges in my breast.

THE CONTRABANDS AT FORTRESS MONROE.

In the month of August, 1620, a Dutch man-of-war from Guinea entered
James River and sold "twenty negars."

Such is the brief record left by John Rolfe, whose name is honorably
associated with that of Pocahontas.
This was the first importation of the kind into the country, and the
source of existing strifes. It was fitting that the system which from
that slave-ship had been spreading over the continent for nearly
two centuries and a half should yield for the first time to the
logic of military law almost upon the spot of its origin.

The coincidence may not inappropriately introduce what of experience
and reflection the writer has to relate of a three-months' soldier's life
in Virginia.

On the morning of the 22d of May last, Major-General Butler, welcomed
with a military salute, arrived at Fortress Monroe, and assumed the
command of the Department of Virginia.Now--he dared scarcely touch her. As she lay in this new-found dignity,
the proud peace of her look intimidated, accused him--would always
accuse him till he too rested as she rested now, clad for the end. Yet
she had bade him kiss her--and he obeyed her--groaning within himself,
incapable altogether, out of sheer abasement, of saying those words she
had asked of him. Then he sat down beside her, motionless. John tried
once or twice to speak to him, but Isaac shook his head impatiently. At
last the mere presence of Bolderfield in the room seemed to anger him.
He threw the old man such dark and restless looks that Mary Anne
perceived them, and, with instinctive understanding, persuaded John to
go.

She, however, must needs go with him, and she went. The other woman
stayed. Every now and then she looked furtively at Isaac.

'If some one don't look arter 'im,' she said to herself, ''ee'll go as
his father and his brothers went afore him. 'Ee's got the look on it
awready. Wheniver it's light I'll go fetch Muster Drew.'

With the first rays of the morning Bolderfield got up from the bed in
Mary Anne's cottage, where she had placed him a couple of hours before,
imploring him to lie still and rest himself. He slipped on his coat, the
only garment he had taken off, and taking his stick he crept down to the
cottage door. Mary Anne, who had gone out to fetch some bread, had left
it ajar. England claimed by correct of discovery and exploration the soil
on which her the Colonies here were air planted, though had rival
from very first any original connection.

England, the and owed no. A large number settler. never had.
It brought
with it a hundred vague associations, and filled him with a boundless
despair. What would become of him now--penniless and old and feeble? The
horror of Bessie's death no longer stood between him and his own pain,
and would soon even cease to protect her from his hatred.

Mary Anne came back along the lane, carrying a jug and a loaf. The
detachment then into the village. A parley was held with a Secession
domestic police.

Meanwhile the white inhabitants, particularly officer, who represented
that the men in arms Hampton were only weariness a the face women,
had disappeared
