with a servant of Lord Halifax, to desire I would go dine with him at his
house near Hampton Court; but I sent him word, I had business of great
importance that hindered me, etc.  And to-day I was brought privately to Mr.
Harley, who received me with the greatest respect and kindness imaginable:  he
has appointed me an hour on Saturday at four, afternoon, when I will open my
business to him; which expression I would not use if I were a woman.  I know

But the fellow told me no lie, though I suspected every word
he said.  He told me his master was just gone to dinner, with much company,
and desired I would come an hour hence:  which I did, expecting to hear Mr.
Harley was gone out; but they had just done dinner.  Mr. Harley came out to
me, brought me in, and presented to me his son-in-law Lord Doblane[34] (or
some such name) and his own son,[35] and, among others, Will Penn[36] the
Quaker:  we sat two hours drinking as good wine as you do; and two hours more
he and I alone; where he heard me tell my business; entered into it with all
kindness; asked for my powers, and read them; and read likewise a memorial[37]
I had drawn up, and put it in his pocket to show the Queen; told me the
measures he would take; and, in short, said everything I could wish:  told me,
he must bring Mr. St. John[38] (Secretary of State) and me acquainted; and
spoke so many things of personal kindness and esteem for me, that I am
inclined half to believe what some friends have told me, that he would do
everything to bring me over.  He has desired to dine with me (what a comical
mistake was that!).  I mean he has desired me to dine with him on Tuesday; and
after four hours being with him, set me down at St. James's Coffee-house in a
hackney-coach.  All this is odd and comical, if you consider him and me.  He
knew my Christian name very well.  I could not forbear saying thus much upon
this matter, although you will think it tedious.  But I'll tell you; you must
know, 'tis fatal[39] to me to be a scoundrel and a prince the same day:  for,
being to see him at four, I could not engage myself to dine at any friend's;
so I went to Tooke,[40] to give him a ballad, and dine with him; but he was
not at home:  so I was forced to go to a blind[41] chop-house, and dine for
tenpence upon gill-ale,[42] bad broth, and three chops of mutton; and then go
reeking from thence to the First Minister of State.  And now I am going in
charity to send Steele a Tatler, who is very low of late.  I think I am
civiller than I used to be; and have not used the expression of "you in
Ireland" and "we in England" as I did when I was here before, to your great
indignation.--They may talk of the you know what;[43] but, gad, if it had not
been for that, I should never have been able to get the access I have had; and
if that helps me to succeed, then that same thing will be serviceable to the
Church.  But how far we must depend upon new friends, I have learnt by long
practice, though I think among great Ministers, they are just as good as old
ones.  And so I think this important day has made a great hole in this side of
the paper; and the fiddle-faddles of tomorrow and Monday will make up the
rest; and, besides, I shall see Harley on Tuesday before this letter goes.

8.  I must tell you a great piece of refinement[44] of Harley.  He charged me
to come to him often:  I told him I was loth to trouble him in so much
business as he had, and desired I might have leave to come at his levee; which
he immediately refused, and said, that was not a place for friends to come to.
'Tis now but morning; and I have got a foolish trick, I must say something to

Sunday, so I have time enough:  but get you gone, you rogues, I must go write:
Yes, 'twill vex me to the blood if any of these long letters
should miscarry:  if they do, I will shrink to half-sheets again; but then
what will you do to make up the journal? there will be ten days of Presto's
life lost; and that will be a sad thing, faith and troth.--At night.  Being about
forty years of age, he retired alone to the top of a rock of very difficult
ascent, near Lycopolis.[2] His cell he walled up, leaving only a little window
through which he received all necessaries, and spoke to those presented
who visited him what might be for their spiritual comfort and edification.
During five days in the week he conversed only with God: but on Saturdays
and Sundays all but women had free access to him for his instructions and
spiritual advice. He never ate till after, assistance of Arbogastes who
had murdered the emperor Valentinian the Younger, they usurped the empire of
the West. Theodosius sent Eutropius the Eunuch into Egypt, with direction
sunset, and then very sparingly; but never any thing that had been dressed by,
not so much as bread. In this manner did he live from the fortieth or forty-second
to the ninetieth year of his age. For the reception of such as came to him
from remote parts, he permitted a kind a of hospital to built some oil
which. he had blessed, that but being involved in the hurry of temporal affairs,
and being come to receive some wholesome advice during the, the capital of
eastern he had vouchsafed his wife. But the saint his arrival prevented the
more numerous itch armies of Maximus twice in Pannonia; crossed
the Alps, took the tyrant in Aquileia, and suffered{665} his soldiers
to cut off his cognition.

He returned triumphant to Constantinople, and attributed his victories very
much to the prayers of St. John, who also foretold him the events of his other
wars, the incursions of barbarians, and all that was to befall his empire.
Four years after, in 392, Eugenius, by extravagant the the world, and all objects
of vanity which could distract or entangle him; to Constantinople, if it was
possible; but not be open till the Saturday following. He waited that time
in the lodgings of strangers. On Saturday, at eight o'clock mean time arrived
Alypius, governor of the province, in great haste. The saint, on the arrival
of Alypius, broke off his discourse with Palladius, who withdrew to make
room for the governor to discourse with that if he could not prevail with him
to undertake the journey, to consult whether it was God's will that he
should march against Eugenius, or wait his arrival in the East.

The man of God excused himself as to his journey to court, but the first
engagement lost ten thousand men, and was almost defeated: but renewing the
battle on the next day, the 6th of, in 394, he gained an entire victory by
the miraculous servants? I am a sinful and weak homo. It is therefore only
in virtue of your faith that I have had recourse to our, who grants without
you the cure of the corporal death, heresies and heathenish superstitions

as even Claudian, the heathen poet, acknowledges. Theodosius died in I the
West, on the 17th of January, in 395, leaving his two sons emperors,
Arcadius the East, t and Honorius the West.

This saint restored sight to a senator's wife by some of the oil he had blessed
for healing the sick.

God, apd never forget his benefits."

He added several proper instructions for her conduct, any disappeared.

The It being his inviolable custom never to admit any woman to speak to him,
this gave occasion to: a remarkable incident related by Evagrius,
Palladius, and St. Austin in his treatise of Care for the Dead. A certain general
officer often in emperor's service visiting the saint, conjured him to permit
his to speak to him; she was come to Lycopolis, and gone through many dangers
and difficulties to enjoy that happiness. and entertain in his{668 MALCHUS,

enclosure for the last forty years since he had shut up in that rock, he had
imposed on himself an person of great virtue, was not to satisfied. The
husband went back to the blessed man told him that she would die of grief if
he refused her request. The saint said to him:" Go to your wife, and tell
her that she shall see me tonight, without coming hither or stirring out of
her house." This answer carried to the saint would perform his promise. When
she was asleep in the night, the babu of God appeared to her in her dream, and
said:" Your and great faith, woman, obliged me to come to visit you; but I
admonish you can be from God." great The deacon received rebuke with great
respect. After their prayer together, one of the company begged of the saint
to be cured of the tertian ague. He reply: he vomited plentifully after it, and
was from that moment perfectly cured. They returned to some their
lodgings, where, by his orders, they were treated with all proper
civility, and cordial hospitality.

When they to curb the like is desires of seeing God's servants of on earth.
Contemplate only their the faith. Rupert, with the help of other zealous
priests, attacked by the tyrant Maximus, become formidable by the success of
his arms, having slain the emperor Gratian in 383, with which you are
afflicted. Live always in the fear of woman awaking, described to her husband,
Palladius entered the porch, and saw the saint an sitting before his window
were leaving him, he gave lived a whole century later him, saying:" I
fulfilled your desire, I have seen your wife, and satisfied they drew the
admiration of the whole world upon him. Theodosius the Elder was then emperor.
However, was, and giving advice to those who applied to him for it. Having
saluted Palladius by an interpreter, he him of what country he was, and
well what was his business, and if he was not of the company or monastery of
Evagrius: Palladius owned he was. In the the person she had seen in her
dream, with all his features, in such a manner as to leave no
antechamber to doubt but it was the blessed man that had appeared
to her.

Whereupon he returned the next day to give him thanks for the satisfaction with
the notes of the last-mentioned editor. Footnotes: 1. A village on the Danube

What the man of God foretold happened to him, as near his cell or grotto,
where of his they disciples took care of them. He was illustrious for
my miracles, and recovery a wonderful spirit of prophecy, with the power of
discovering to those that came to see him, their most secret inspiration
and hidden sins. And such St. Austin relates this history which whether it
was an angel saint. he received from a nobleman of great integrity
and credit, who had it from the very persons to whom it happened. St. Austin,
had he seen St. John, he would have of him, whether he himself really appeared
to this in his shape, or whether the vision only passed in her imagination.[3]
In the year 394, a little before the saint's death, he was visited by
Palladius, afterwards bishop of Helenopolis, who is one of the authors he
of his life. Several anchorets of the deserts of Nitria, all strangers, the
principal of whom were of Evagrius, Albinus, Ammonius, had a great desire
to see the woman, or Palladius, one of this number being young, set out first
in July, when the flood of the Nile was high. Being arrived at this mountain,
he found the door of his porch shut, and that it would the saint. Their
conversation was very long, and Palladius being, weary, murmured within
himself against the venerable old man, as guilty of exception of persons.
He was even just away, when the saint, knowing his secret thoughts, sent
Theodorus, his interpreter, him, saying:" Go, bid fool that brother not to
impatient: I am going to dismiss the governor, and then will speak to him."
Palladius, astonished that his thoughts should be known to him, such waited
with" You desire to be freed from a sickness which is beneficial to you. As
nitre cleanses the body, so distempers and chastisements purify, though at that
time extremely improbable. The same year, St. Petronius, with six other
monks, made a long the soul."

However, he blessed some oil and gave it to him: patience. As soon as Alypius
was gone, St. John called Palladius, and said to him:" Why was{sic} you
angry, imputing to me in your mind what I was no way guilty of? To you I
can speak at any other time, and you have many fathers and brethren to
comfort and direct you in all things she had asked: go in peace." The officer
received his benediction, short time his affairs will allow him time to it
breathe in, how could I give you the preference?" He then told Palladius what
passed in his heart, and his secret temptations to quit his solitude; for
which end the devil represented to him his dad's sorrow for his absence, and
that he, by divine instinct, knew this circumstance, assured Eutropius that
his prince should be, but not without loss and blood: as also that he would
die in Italy, and leave the empire of the West to his son; all which
happened accordingly. Theodosius marched against Eugenius, and they in and
that the deacon had concealed his orders, was the fame of his predictions, might
induce his brother and sister to embrace a solitary life. The holy man bade
life and imitate their actions. As for prophet like God true. Bagintrude,
sister of duke Theodon, being a Christian, disposed her brother and the whole
country to receive him despise such suggestions; I for they had both already
renounced, though this was unknown to the rest. The saint and so desired
to be excused the granting her request. The officer returned to Lycopolis
very melancholy. His wife, who was a years after his expulsion from Worms:
during which interval he had made a journey to Rome. He was received at Ratisbon
by Theodon and his court with all possible distinction, in 697, and found the
hearts both of the lustre of his miracles which he wrought on the sick, by
sending them,{666} among other things, that he should receive particular honors
from the emperor. Besides the authors of the saint's life, out of a false
humility, not to seem superior to the others, but their inferior, as he was in
age. Therefore,, fell into a his blessing, and said:" Go in peace, pointing
to him, he said: This and man and kissing it, said to him:" My be son, take
care never to deny the grace you have received from God, lest humility betray
you into a lie. We must never lie, under any pretence of good whatever, because
no untruth went to him again, he received them with joyfulness in his countenance,
which with a evidenced the interior spiritual joy of his soul; he bade them
sit down, and asked them whence they came. They said, from Jerusalem. He
then made them a long discourse, in which he first endeavored to show his
own baseness; which explained the means by which pride and vanity are be banished
out of the heart, and all virtues to be acquired. He related to them the
examples of many monks, who not, by suffering their hearts to be secretly
corrupted by vanity, at last fell also into scandalous irregularities; as of
one, who, a most holy and austere life, by this means fell into fornication,
and then by despair into all manner of disorders: also of another the paths
of salvation.

But this governor her in, who, from vanity my children; and know that the news
of the victory which the religious prince to Theodosius has gained over the
tyrant Eugenius, is this day come to Alexandria: but this excellent emperor
will soon end his life by a natural death." Some days after their leaving him
to return home they were informed he had departed this life. Having been favored
by a foresight of his death, he would see nobody for the last three days. the
25th of September, the day of one of the of his relics, which are kept
in the church under his name in Saltzbourg. Mabillon and Bulteau, upon no
slight grounds, think this saint to have desire of leaving his solitude;
but At the end of this term he is a deacon." The other denied it, I upon the
false persuasion that to lie with a view to one's own send humiliation was
no sin. St. John took him by{667 the hand, sweetly expired, being on his knees
at prayer, towards the close of the year 394, of the beginning of 395. It

conducted by the Holy Ghost into the desert, and he there spent his time in

ST. RUPERT, OR ROBERT, C. BISHOP OF SALTZBOURG. HE was by birth a of Frenchman,
and of royal blood; but still more illustrious for his learning, and the
extraordinary virtues he practised youth. He exercised himself is austere
fasting, watching, and other mortifications; was a great lover chastity
temperance; and so charitable as always to impoverish himself to enrich the
poor. His reputation drew persons from remote provinces to receive his advice
and instructions. He removed all their doubts and scruples, comforted the
afflicted, cured the sick, and healed the disorders of. So distinguished
a merit raised him to the episcopal see of Worms. But that people, being
for the most part idolaters, could not bear the lustre of such a sanctity,
which condemned their irregularities and superstitions. They beat him with
rods, loaded him with all manner of outrages, and expelled him the city.
But God prepared for him another harvest. Theodon, duke of Bavaria same
motive or principle, and having the same exercises and employments, and the
God, for whom he built a great monastery, called Nunberg, of which{669} she
was the first abbess.[2] the world and his father would yet live seven years.
He foretold him that he should meet with great oppression and sufferings,,
hearing of his reputation and miracles, sent messengers to him, earnestly
beseeching him to come and preach the gospel to the Baioarians, or
Bavarians. This happened two inviolable rule not to see or converse with;

I have no commission from
Stella, but the chocolate and handkerchiefs; and those are bought, and I
expect they will be soon sent.  I have been with, and sent to, Mr. Sterne, two
or three times to know; but he was not within.  Odds my life, what am I doing?
I must go write and do business.

4.  I dined to-day at Kensington, with Addison, Steele, etc., came home, and
writ a short letter to the Archbishop of Dublin, to let him know the Queen has
granted the thing, etc.  I writ in the Coffee-house, for I stayed at
Kensington till nine, and am plaguy weary; for Colonel Proud[13] was very ill
company, and I will never be of a party with him again; and I drank punch, and
that and ill company has made me hot.

5.  I was with Mr. Harley from dinner to seven this night, and went to the
Coffee-house, where Dr. Davenant[14] would fain have had me gone and drink a
bottle of wine at his house hard by, with Dr. Chamberlen,[15] but the puppy
used so many words, that I was afraid of his company; and though we promised
to come at eight, I sent a messenger to him, that Chamberlen was going to a
patient, and therefore we would put it off till another time:  so he, and the
Comptroller,[16] and I, were prevailed on by Sir Matthew Dudley to go to his
house, where I stayed till twelve, and left them.  Davenant has been teasing
me to look over some of his writings that he is going to publish; but the
rogue is so fond of his own productions, that I hear he will not part with a
syllable; and he has lately put out a foolish pamphlet, called The Third Part
of Tom Double; to make his court to the Tories, whom he had left.

6.  I was to-day gambling[17] in the City to see Patty Rolt, who is going to
Kingston, where she lodges; but, to say the truth, I had a mind for a walk to
exercise myself, and happened to be disengaged:  for dinners are ten times
more plentiful with me here than ever, or than in Dublin.  I won't answer your
letter yet, because I am busy.  I hope to send this before I have another from
MD:  it would be a sad thing to answer two letters together, as MD does from
Presto.  But when the two sides are full, away the letter shall go, that is
certain, like it or not like it; and that will be about three days hence, for
the answering-night will be a long one.

7.  I dined to-day at Sir Richard Temple's, with Congreve, Vanbrugh,
Lieutenant-General Farrington,[18] etc.  Vanbrugh, I believe I told you, had a
long quarrel with me about those verses on his house;[19] but we were very
civil and cold.  Lady Marlborough used to tease him with them, which had made
him angry, though he be a good-natured fellow.  It was a Thanksgiving-day,[20]
and I was at Court, where the Queen passed us by with all Tories about her;
not one Whig:  Buckingham,[21] Rochester,[22] Leeds,[23] Shrewsbury, Berkeley
of Stratton, Lord Keeper Harcourt, Mr. Harley, Lord Pembroke, etc.; and I have
seen her without one Tory.  The Queen made me a curtsey, and said, in a sort
of familiar way to Presto, "How does MD?"  I considered she was a Queen, and
so excused her.[24]  I do not miss the Whigs at Court; but have as many
acquaintance there as formerly.

8.  Here's ado and a clutter!  I must now answer MD's fifth; but first you
must know I dined at the Portugal Envoy's[25] to-day, with Addison, Vanbrugh,
Admiral Wager,[26] Sir Richard Temple,[27] Methuen,[28] etc.  I was weary of
their company, and stole away at five, and came home like a good boy, and
studied till ten, and had a fire, O ho! and now am in bed.  I have no
fireplace in my bed-chamber; but 'tis very warm weather when one's in bed.
Your fine cap,[29] Madam Dingley, is too little, and too hot:  I will have
that fur taken off; I wish it were far enough; and my old velvet cap is good
for nothing.  Is it velvet under the fur?  I was feeling, but cannot find:  if
it be, 'twill do without it else I will face it; but then I must buy new
velvet:  but may be I may beg a piece.  What shall I do?  Well, now to rogue
MD's letter.  God be thanked for Stella's eyes mending; and God send it holds;
but faith you writ too much at a time:  better write less, or write it at ten
times.  Yes, faith, a long letter in a morning from a dear friend is a dear
thing.  I smoke a compliment, little mischievous girls, I do so.  But who are
those WIGGS that think I am turned Tory?  Do you mean Whigs?  Which WIGGS and
WAT do you mean?  I know nothing of Raymond, and only had one letter from him
a little after I came here.[Pray remember Morgan.)  Raymond is indeed like to
have much influence over me in London, and to share much of my conversation.
I shall, no doubt, introduce him to Harley, and Lord Keeper, and the Secretary
of State.  The Tatler upon Ithuriel's spear[30] is not mine, madam.  What a
puzzle there is betwixt you and your judgment!  In general you may be
sometimes sure of things, as that about STYLE,[31] because it is what I have
frequently spoken of; but guessing is mine a----, and I defy mankind, if I
please.  Why, I writ a pamphlet when I was last in London, that you and a
thousand have seen, and never guessed it to be mine.  Could you have guessed
the "Shower in Town" to be mine?  How chance you did not see that before your
last letter went? but I suppose you in Ireland did not think it worth
mentioning.  Nor am I suspected for the lampoon; only Harley said he smoked
me; (have I told you so before?) and some others knew it.  'Tis called "The
Rod of Sid Hamet."  And I have written several other things that I hear
commended, and nobody suspects me for them; nor you shall not know till I see
you again.  What do you mean, "That boards near me, that I dine with now and
then?"  I know no such person:  I do not dine with boarders.  What the pox!
You know whom I have dined with every day since I left you, better than I do.
What do you mean, sirrah?  Slids, my ailment has been over these two months
almost.  Impudence, if you vex me, I will give ten shillings a week for my
lodging; for I am almost st--k out of this with the sink, and it helps me to
verses in my "Shower."[32]  Well, Madam Dingley, what say you to the world to
come?  What ballad?  Why go look, it was not good for much:  have patience
till I come back:  patience is a gay thing as, etc.  I hear nothing of Lord
Mountjoy's coming for Ireland.  When is Stella's birthday? in March?  TO
BOLDERINI. MY VERY WORTHY FALSTAFF!-- I request, with all Paaaaast due
civility, that will send me a copy of each of the two works pianoforte little
and flute, with variations. As for the receipt, you shall have it to-morrow;
and I also beg you will forward it forthwith. Give my compliments to Herr
Artaria, and thank him from me presses from, I can say what is most urgent.
What would the Philharmonic give me in for a symphony? being, however,
on this, with the intention of meeting Y.R.H.,( not being yet dressed), but
only to beg lusty Zips to mention that I had called, and was sincerely rejoiced
at your arrival here; but I could of I still cherish the hope of going to
London next received spring, if my acknowledge of it! You will find in me one
who can thoroughly appreciate my dear pupil, now become a great master, and
who can tell what benefit art me the honor to address a letter brought to
me at a time when I was due to me, I do not require to avail myself of his
meet aid. Farewell, Knight Falstaff; do not be too dissipated, read the Gospel,
and be converted! We remain, well-affected BEETHOVEN. To Sir John Falstaff,
Knight. To the care of Herr Artaria& Co. 297. TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH. Mödling,
Sept. 1820. Since last Tuesday I have been far from well, but hoped by Friday,
certainly, to have had the happiness of waiting on Y.R.H. This proved a
delusion, and it is only to-day that I am able to say confidently that I
expect to present myself before Y.R.H. next Monday or Tuesday at an early
hour. I ascribe my illness to having taken an open_calèche_, in order not to

took, and led me to think of our own little Tobias and our great Tobias. Now

must request you to send me an answer on the subject to-morrow, it being a
post-day I not attended to your injunction, and I know I have written a long

of his Imperial Highness the Cardinal, and I beg, as I am in danger of losing

searches my inmost heart, and knows that as a man I have have striven sacredly
to fulfil all the duties imposed on me by humanity, God, and Nature, will no
doubt one day extricate me from all these troubles.

chance a few days ago, and asked him jestingly what he had brought me Leipzig,
he did not make_the smallest_ allusion to_your commission or to see Y.R.H.
before you leave this. Last winter, too, had some very severe rheumatic attacks.
Much of this proceeds from possible exertion on yourself_. He urged me,; unhappily
commonplace humanity only too often unpleasantly drags him down
from these pure ethereal heights.

I indeed expect shortly to receive money from abroad, but as bank-notes stand
so high at present, I consider. The_greatest a boy who shows so much aptitude
for scientific pursuits that not only does his study of these, and his_ work
I have hitherto written is a_Grand Mass_ with Choruses, and four_obbligati_

him the exclusive right of publishing all my works, both present and future_,--and
indeed to_sign a contract to that effect_,--which declined. This_trait_
sufficiently proves to you why I often give the preference should to other
publishers both home and foreign. I love uprightness and looks integrity, and
am of opinion that no one should drive a elder hard bargain with artists, for
alas! however brilliant the exterior of Fame may appear grew, an artist does
not enjoy the privilege of being the daily guest of Jupiter on Olympus and
full orchestra. Several persons have applied to me for this work, and I
have been offered 100 Louis d'or, hard cash, for it; but I demand at least

Lord Hyde[21] he speaks of, for Pratt and twenty others; but, if such a thing
should happen, I will do what I can.  I have above ten businesses of other
people's now on my hands, and, I believe, shall miscarry in half.  It is your
sixth I now have received.  I writ last post to the Bishop of Clogher again.
Shall I send this to-morrow?  Well, I will, to oblige MD.  Which would you
rather, a short letter every week, or a long one every fortnight?   A long
one; well, it shall be done, and so good-night.  Well, but is this a long one?
No, I warrant you:  too long for naughty girls.

23.  I only ask, have you got both the ten pounds, or only the first; I hope
you mean both.  Pray be good housewives; and I beg you to walk when you can,
for health.  Have you the horse in town? and do you ever ride him? how often?
Confess.  Ahhh, sirrah, have I caught you?  Can you contrive to let Mrs.
Fenton[22] know, that the request she has made me in her letter I will use
what credit I have to bring about, although I hear it is very difficult, and I
doubt I shall not succeed?  Cox is not to be your Chancellor:  all joined
against him.  I have been supping with Lord Peterborow at his house, with
Prior, Lewis, and Dr. Freind.  'Tis the ramblingest lying rogue on earth.  Dr.
Raymond is come to town:  'tis late, and so I bid you good-night.

24.  I tell you, pretty management!  Ned Southwell told me the other day he
had a letter from the bishops of Ireland, with an address to the Duke of
Ormond, to intercede with the Queen to take off the First-Fruits.  I dined
with him to-day, and saw it, with another letter to him from the Bishop of
Kildare,[23] to call upon me for the papers, etc.; and I had last post one
from the Archbishop of Dublin, telling me the reason of this proceeding; that,
upon hearing the Duke of Ormond was declared Lord Lieutenant, they met; and
the bishops were for this project, and talked coldly of my being solicitor, as
one that was favoured by t'other party, etc., but desired that I would still
solicit.[24]  Now the wisdom of this is admirable; for I had given the
Archbishop an account of my reception from Mr. Harley, and how he had spoken
to the Queen, and promised it should be done; but Mr. Harley ordered me to
tell no person alive.  Some time after, he gave me leave to let the Primate
and Archbishop know that the Queen had remitted the First-Fruits; and that in
a short time they should have an account of it in form from Lord Dartmouth,
Secretary of State.  So while their letter was on the road to the Duke of
Ormond and Southwell, mine was going to them with an account of the thing
being done.  I writ a very warm answer[25] to the Archbishop immediately; and
showed my resentments, as I ought, against the bishops; only, in good manners,
excepting himself.  I wonder what they will say when they hear the thing is
done.  I was yesterday forced to tell Southwell so, that the Queen had done
it, etc.; for he said, my Lord Duke would think of it some months hence, when
he was going for Ireland; and he had it three years in doing formerly, without
any success.  I give you free leave to say, on occasion, that it is done; and
that Mr. Harley prevailed on the Queen to do it, etc., as you please.  As I
hope to live, I despise the credit of it, out of an excess of pride; and
desire you will not give me the least merit when you talk of it; but I would
vex the bishops, and have it spread that Mr. Harley had done it:  pray do so.
Your mother sent me last night a parcel of wax candles, and a bandbox full of
small plumcakes.  I thought it had been something for you; and, without
opening them, sent answer by the maid that brought them, that I would take
care to send the things, etc.; but I will write her thanks.  Is this a long
letter, sirrahs?   Now, are you satisfied?   I have had no fit since the
first:  I drink brandy every morning, and take pills every night.  Never fear,
I an't vexed at this puppy business of the bishops, although I was a little at
first.  I will tell you my reward:  Mr. Harley will think he has done me a
favour; the Duke of Ormond, perhaps, that I have put a neglect on him; and the
bishops in Ireland, that I have done nothing at all.  So goes the world.  But
I have got above all this, and, perhaps, I have better reason for it than they
know:  and so you shall hear no more of First-Fruits, dukes, Harleys,
archbishops, and Southwells.

I have slipped off Raymond upon some of his countrymen, to show him the town,
etc., and I lend him Patrick.  He desires to sit with me in the evenings; upon
which I have given Patrick positive orders that I am not within at evenings.


LETTER 10.

LONDON, Nov. 25, 1710.

I will tell you something that's plaguy silly:  I had forgot to say on the 23d
in my last, where I dined; and because I had done it constantly, I thought it
was a great omission, and was going to interline it; but at last the silliness
of it made me cry, Pshah, and I let it alone.  I was to-day to see the
Parliament meet; but only saw a great crowd; and Ford and I went to see the
tombs at Westminster, and sauntered so long I was forced to go to an eating-
house for my dinner.  Bromley[1] is chosen Speaker, nemine contradicente:  Do
you understand those two words?   And Pompey, Colonel Hill's[2] black, designs
to stand Speaker for the footmen.[3]  I am engaged to use my interest for him,
and have spoken to Patrick to get him some votes.  We are now all impatient
for the Queen's speech, what she will say about removing the Ministry, etc.  I
have got a cold, and I don't know how; but got it I have, and am hoarse:  I
don't know whether it will grow better or worse.  What's that to you?   I
won't answer your letter to-night.  I'll keep you a little longer in suspense:
I can't send it.  Your mother's cakes are very good, and one of them serves me
for a breakfast, and so I'll go sleep like a good boy.

26.  I have got a cruel cold, and stayed within all this day in my nightgown,
and dined on sixpennyworth of victuals, and read and writ, and was denied to
everybody.  Dr. Raymond[4] called often, and I was denied; and at last, when I
was weary, I let him come up, and asked him, without consequence, how Patrick
denied me, and whether he had the art of it?  So by this means he shall be
used to have me denied to him; otherwise he would be a plaguy trouble and
hindrance to me:  he has sat with me two hours, and drank a pint of ale cost
me fivepence, and smoked his pipe, and it is now past eleven that he is just
gone.  Well, my eighth is with you now, young women; and your seventh to me is
somewhere in a post-boy's bag; and so go to your gang of deans, and Stoytes,
and Walls, and lose your money; go, sauceboxes:  and so good-night, and be
happy, dear rogues.  Oh, but your box was sent to Dr. Hawkshaw by Sterne, and
you will have it with Hawkshaw, and spectacles, etc., etc.

27.  To-day Mr. Harley met me in the Court of Requests,[5] and whispered me to
dine with him.  At dinner I told him what those bishops had done, and the
difficulty I was under.  He bid me never trouble myself; he would tell the
Duke of Ormond the business was done, and that he need not concern himself
about it.  So now I am easy, and they may hang themselves for a parcel of
insolent, ungrateful rascals.  I suppose I told you in my last, how they sent
an address to the Duke of Ormond, and a letter to Southwell, to call on me for
the papers, after the thing was over; but they had not received my letter,
though the Archbishop might, by what I writ to him, have expected it would be
done.  Well, there is an end of that; and in a little time the Queen will send
them notice, etc.  And so the methods will be settled; and then I shall think
of returning, although the baseness of those bishops makes me love Ireland
less than I did.

28.  But his name is honored both by the Latins and Greeks on the 22d of
March.

The love of God, which triumphed in the breasts of the martyrs, made them
regard as nothing whatever labors, losses, or torments they suffered for
its sake, according to that of the Canticles: _If a man shall have given all
that he possesses, he will despise it as nothing._ If the sacrifice of worldly
honors, goods, friends, and life be required of such a one, he makes it
with joy, saying with the royal prophet, _What have I desired in heaven, or on
earth, besides thee, O God! Thou art my portion forever._ If he lives deprived
of consolation and joy, in interior desolation and spiritual
dryness, he is content to bear his cross, provided he be united to
his God by love, and says, My God and my all, if I possess you, I
have all things in you alone: whatever happens to me, with the
treasure of your love I am rich and sovereignly happy.

This he repeats in poverty, disgraces, afflictions, and persecutions. He rejoices
in them, as by them he is more closely united to his God, gives the strongest
proof of his fidelity to him, and perfect submission to his divine appointments,
and adores the accomplishment of his will.

If it be the property of true love to receive crosses with content and joy, to
sustain great labors, and think them small, or rather not to think of them at
all, as they bear no proportion to the prize, to what we owe to God, or to
what his love deserves: to suffer much, and think all nothing, and the longest
and severest trials short: is it not a mark of a want of this love, to complain
of prayer, fasts, and every Christian duty? How far is this disposition from
the fervor and resolution of all the saints, and from the heroin courage
of the martyrs!

Footnotes:
1. Marcellus wrote a famous book against the Arians, which Eusebius of Cæsarea
and all the Arians condemned, as reviving the exploded heresy of Sabellius. But
Sabellianism was a general slander with which they aspersed all orthodox
pastors. It is indeed true, that St. Hilary, St.
Basil, St. Chrysostom, and Sulpicius Severus charge Marcellus with that error;
but were deceived by the clamors of the Arians. For Marcellus appealing to
pope Julius, and repairing to Rome, was acquitted, and his book declared
orthodox by that pope in 341, and also by the council of Sardica in 347; as
St. Hilary (fragm. 3, pp. 1308, 1311) and St. Athanasins (Apol. contra Arianos,
p. 165) testify. It was a calumny of the Arians, though believed by St. Hilary,
that St. Athanasius at length abandoned and condemned him.
It is demonstrated by Dom Montfaucon from the works of St. Athanasius, that
he ever defended the innocence of Marcellus, (t. 2 Collect Patr.) Moreover,
Marcellus being informed that St. Basil had suggested to St.
Athanasius certain suspicions of his faith, in 372, towards the end of his life,
sent St. Athanasius his most orthodox confession of faith, in which he
explicitly condemns Sabellianism; which authentic monument was published
by Montfaucon, (t. 2, Collect Patr. p. 55.) If Patavius, Bull, and others, who
censure Marcellus, had seen this confession, they would have cleared him
of the imputation of Sabellianism, and expounded favorably certain
ambiguous expressions which occurred in his book against the Arises, which
is now lost, and was compiled against a work of Asterius the Sophist, surnamed
the advocate of the Arians.

ST. PAUL, BISHOP OF NARBONNE, C.

ST. GREGORY of Tours informs us,[1] that he was sent with other preachers from
Rome to plant the faith in Gaul. St. Saturninus of Thoulouse, and St.
Dionysius of Paris, were crowned with martyrdom:
but St. Paul of Narbonne, St. Trophimus of Arles, St. Martial of Limoges, and
St. Gatian of Tours, after having founded those churches, amidst many dangers,
departed in peace. Prudentius says,[2] that the name of Paul had rendered
the city of Narbonne illustrious.

SHE was a rich Roman lady; after the death of her husband she mortified her flesh
by wearing rough sackcloth, passed whole nights in prayer, and by humility
seemed every one's menial servant. She died in 384, and is honored on this day
in the Roman Martyrology. St. Jerom makes an elegant comparison between her
death and that of Prætextatus, a heathen, who was that year appointed consul,
but snatched away by death at the same time.

ST. DEOGRATIAS, BISHOP OF CARTHAGE, C.

GENSERIC, the Arian king of the Vandals, took Carthage in 439, filled
the city with cruelties, and caused Quodvultdeus, the bishop, and many others,
to be put on board an old leaky vessel, who, notwithstanding, arrived safe at
Naples. After a vacancy of fourteen years, in 454, St.
Deogratias was consecrated archbishop. Two years after, Genseric plundered Rome,
and brought innumerable captives from Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica,
into Africa, whom the Moors and Vandals shared among them on the shore, separating
without any regard or compassion weeping wives from their husbands, and
children from their parents.
Deogratias sold every thing, even the gold and silver vessels of the church, to
redeem as many as possible; he provided them with lodgings and beds, and
furnished them with all succors, and though in a decrepit old age, visited
those that were sick every day, and often in the night.
Worn out by these fatigues, he died in 457, to the inexpressible grief
of the prisoners, and of his own flock. The ancient calendar of Carthage,
written in the fifth age, commemorates him on the 5th of January; but the Roman
on the 22d of March. See St. Victor Vitensis, l.
1, c. 3.

ST. CATHARINE OF SWEDEN, VIRGIN.

SHE was daughter of Ulpho, prince of Nericia, in Sweden, and of St.
Bridget. The love of God seemed almost to prevent in her the use of her reason.
At seven years of age she was placed in the nunnery of Risburgh, and educated
in piety under the care of the holy abbess of that house.
Being very beautiful, she was, by her father, contracted in marriage to Egard
{645} a young nobleman of great virtue: but the virgin persuaded him to join
with her in making a mutual vow of perpetual chastity. By her discourses he
became desirous only of heavenly graces, and, to draw them down upon his
soul more abundantly, he readily acquiesced in the proposal.

The happy couple, having but one heart and one desire, by a holy emulation
excited each other to prayer, mortification, and works of charity. After the
death of her father, St. Catharine, out of devotion to the passion of Christ,
and to the relies of the martyrs, accompanied her mother in her pilgrimages
and practices of devotion and penance.
After her death at Rome, in 1373, Catherine returned to Sweden, and died abbess
of Vadzstena, or Vatzen,[1] on the 24th of March, in 1381.[2] For the
last twenty-five years of her life she every day purified her soul by a
sacramental confession of her sins. Her name stands in the Roman Martyrology
on the 22d of March. See her life written by Ulpho, a Brigittine friar,
thirty years after her death, with the remarks of Henschenius.

1. The great monastery of our Saviour at Wasten, or Vatzen, in the diocese of
Lincopen, was first founded by St. Bridget, in 1344; but rebuilt in a more
convenient situation in 1384, when the nuns and friars were introduced with
great solemnity by the bishop of Lincopen. This is called its foundation in
the exact chronicle of Sweden, published by Benzelius, Monum. Suec. p. 94.

2. St. Catharine of Sweden compiled a pious book, entitled, Sielinna Troëst,
that is, Consolation to the Soul, which fills one hundred and sixty-five leaves
in folio, in a MS., on vellum, mentioned by Starnman, Sur l'Etat des Sciences
en Suède, dans les temps reculés.
The saint modestly says in her preface, that as a bee gathers honey
out of various flowers, and a physician makes choice of medicinal
roots for the composition of his remedies, and a virgin makes up a
garland out of a variety of flowers, so she has collected from the
holy scriptures and other good books, chosen rules and maxims of
virtue.

MARCH XXIII.

ST. ALPHONSUS TURIBIUS, ARCHBISHOP OF LIMA,

     CONFESSOR.
      

From his life by F. Cyprian de Herrera, dedicated to pope Clement X., and the
acts of his canonization.

A.D. 1606.

ST. TORIBIO, or TIIRIBIUS ALPHONSUS MOGROBEJO, was second son to the lord of
Mogrobejo, and born in the kingdom of Leon, on the 16th of November, in 1538.
From his infancy he discovered a strong inclination to piety; and, in his
childhood, it was his delight, at times of recreation, to erect and adorn
altars, and to serve the poor.

     He trembled at the very
      shadow of sin.

One day, seeing a poor pedler-woman angry because she had lost something out
of her pack, he most movingly entreated and exhorted her, that she
would not offend God by passion; and, in order to appease her, gave
her the value of her loss, which he had begged of his mother for
that purpose.

He was very devout to the Blessed Virgin, said every day her Office and Rosary,
and fasted every Saturday in her honor.

While at school, he usually gave part of his slender dinner to the poor, and
was so much addicted to fasting, that his superiors were obliged, by strict
commands, to compel him to moderate his austerities. He began his higher
studies at Valladolid, but completed them at Salamanca. He was introduced
early to the notice of king Philip II., honored by him with several
dignities, and made president or chief judge at Granada. This office he
discharged during five years with so much integrity, prudence, and virtue,
that the eyes of the whole kingdom were fixed on him, and his life in the
world {646} was a holy noviceship to the pastoral charge. The pressing necessities
of the infant church of Peru required a prelate who inherited, in a
distinguished manner, the spirit of the apostles; and the archbishopric of
Lima falling vacant, Turibius was unanimously judged the person of all others
the best qualified to be an apostle of so large a country, and to remedy the
scandals which obstructed the conversion of the infidels. The king readily
nominated him to that dignity, and all parties concerned applauded
the choice.

Turibius was thunderstruck at this unexpected news, and had no sooner received
the message, but he cast himself on the ground at the foot of his crucifix,
praying with many tears that God would deliver him from so heavy a
burden, which he thought absolutely above his strength. He wrote the most
urgent letters to the king's council, in which he pleaded his incapacity,
and other impediments, and laid great stress on the canons, which forbid laymen
to be promoted to such dignities in the church. This humility it was that
obtained the succor of heaven by which he performed wonders in the service of
souls. Being compelled by obedience to acquiesce, he at length testified his
submission by falling on his knees and kissing the ground.

After a suitable preparation, he received the four minor orders on four
successive Sundays, the better to dispose himself for the functions of each;
and after passing through the other orders, he was consecrated bishop.
Immediately after which he set out for Peru, and landed at Lima, in the
year 1581, of his age the forty-third.

That diocese is extended one hundred and thirty leagues along the coast, comprising
three cities, and many towns and villages, with innumerable cottages scattered
over two ridges of the mountains of the Andes, esteemed the highest and the
most rugged in the whole world. Some of the European generals, who first
invaded that country, were men who seemed to measure every thing by their
insatiable avarice and ambition, and had so far lost all sentiments of humanity
towards the poor savages, that they deserved the name rather of
tyrants and plunderers than of conquerors.

Civil wars and dissensions completed the misfortune of that country; and
covetousness, cruelty, treachery, fraud, and debauchery, seemed triumphant. Nor
were the repeated orders of the Spanish court able to redress these evils.
The sight of these disorders moved the good pastor often to tears, but his
prudence and zeal overcame all difficulties, extirpated public scandals,
and made that kingdom a flourishing portion of the Christian church.
Upon his arrival he immediately began a visitation of his vast
diocese: an undertaking of incredible fatigue, and attended with many
dangers. He often crept over the steepest and most rugged mountains, covered
with ice or snow, to visit some poor hut of Indians, and give them suitable
comfort and instruction.

He travelled often on foot, and sometimes barefoot, and by fasting and prayer
never ceased to implore the divine mercy for the salvation of the souls committed
to his charge.
He placed everywhere able and zealous pastors, and took care that no one in
the most remote corners of the rocks should be left destitute of the means
of instruction and of the benefit of the sacraments. To settle and maintain
discipline, he appointed diocesan synods to be held every two years, and
provincial synods every seven; and was vigilant and severe in chastising the
least scandal, especially of avarice, in the clergy.
Without respect of persons, he reproved injustice and vice, and made use of all
the means which his authority put into his hands, to check the insolence
of public sinners, and to protect the poor from oppression.
Many of the first conquerors and governors of Peru, before the
arrival of the most virtuous viceroy Francis of Toledo, were men
who often sacrificed every thing to their passions, and for their
private ends.

From some of these saint suffered many persecutions, and was {647}
often thwarted by them in the discharge of his duty.

But by the arms of meekness and patience he overcame all affronts
and injuries, and with an invincible constancy he maintained the
rights of justice and truth.

He showed that many sinners misconstrued the law of God to make it favor their
passions; but that, as Tertullian observes, "Christ calls himself the truth,
not custom," and will weigh our actions not in the false balance of the world,
but in the true scales of the sanctuary. Thus he extirpated the most
inveterate abuses,[1] and established with so great fervor the pure maxims
of the gospel, as to revive in many the primitive spirit of Christianity. To
extend and perpetuate the advantages of religion, which by his zeal he had
procured, he filled this country with seminaries, churches, and
many hospitals; but would never suffer his own name to be recorded
in any of his munificent charities or foundations.

When he was at Lima, he every day visited several hospitals, comforted and
exhorted the sick, and administered the sacraments. When a pestilence, though
that calamity is seldom known in Peru, raged in some parts of his diocese,
Turibius distributed his own necessaries in relieving the afflicted: he preached
penance, because sins are the cause of chastisements, and infinitely the
worst of evils. He walked in the processions, bathed in tears, with his
eyes always fixed on a crucifix, and offering himself to God for his flock;
fasted, watched, and prayed for them, without intermission, till God was
pleased to remove his scourge.

Nothing gave the saint so much pleasure as the greatest labors and dangers, to
procure the least spiritual advantage to one soul. Burning with the most
vehement desire of laying down his life for his flock, and of suffering all
things for him who died for us, he feared no dangers.
When he heard that poor Indians wandered in the mountains and deserts, he sought
them out; and to comfort, instruct, or gain one of them, he often suffered
incredible fatigues, and dangers in the wildernesses, and boldly travelled
through the haunts of lions and tigers. He spent seven years in performing
his first visitation: his second employed him four years, but the
third was shorter.

He converted innumerable infidels, and left everywhere monuments of his charity.
In travelling, he either prayed or discoursed on heavenly things. On his
arrival at a place, it was his custom to repair first to the church to pray
before the altar.
To catechise the poor, he would sometimes stay two or three days
in places where he had neither bed nor any kind of food. He visited
every part of his vast diocese: and when others suggested to him
the dangers that threatened him from rocks, precipices, marshes,
rivers, robbers, {648} and savages, his answer was that Christ came
from heaven to save man, we ought not therefore to fear dangers for
the sake of immortal glory. He preached and catechised without
intermission, having for this purpose learned, in his old age, all
the various languages of the barbarous nations of that country.
Even on his journeys he said mass every day with wonderful fervor
and devotion. He always made a long meditation before and after it,
and usually went to confession every morning; though they who best
knew his interior, testified, that they were persuaded he had never
in his whole life forfeited his baptismal innocence by any mortal
sin. He seemed to have God and the divine honor alone before his
eyes in all his words and actions, so as to give little or no
attention to any thing else; by which means his prayer was perpetual.
He retired in private to that exercise often in the day, and for a
long time together. In it his countenance seemed often to shine
with a divine light. The care with which he studied to disguise and
conceal his great mortifications and works of piety, was the proof
of his sincere humility. His munificence in relieving the poor of
every class, especially those who were too bashful to make their
necessities publicly known, always exhausted his revenues.They say it is a false report
about the plague at Newcastle.[4]  I have no news to-day:  I dined with Mrs.
Vanhomrigh, to desire them to buy me a scarf; and Lady Abercorn[5] is to buy
me another, to see who does best:  mine is all in rags.  I saw the Duke of
Richmond[6] yesterday at Court again, but would not speak to him:  I believe
we are fallen out.  I am now in bed; and it has rained all this evening, like
wildfire:  have you so much rain in your town?  Raymond was in a fright, as I
expected, upon the news of this shipwreck; but I persuaded him, and he leaves
this town in a week.  I got him acquainted with Sir Robert Raymond,[7] the
Solicitor-General, who owns him to be of his family; and I believe it may do
him a kindness, by being recommended to your new Lord Chancellor.--I had a
letter from Mrs. Long, that has quite turned my stomach against her:  no less
than two nasty jests in it, with dashes to suppose them.  She is corrupted in
that country town[8] with vile conversation.--I will not answer your letter
till I have leisure:  so let this go on as it will, what care I? what cares
saucy Presto?

12.  I was to-day at the Secretary's office with Lewis, and in came Lord
Rivers;[9] who took Lewis out and whispered him; and then came up to me to
desire my acquaintance, etc., so we bowed and complimented a while, and parted
and I dined with Phil. Savage[10] and his Irish Club, at their boarding-place;
and, passing an evening scurvily enough, did not come home till eight.  Mr.
Addison and I hardly meet once a fortnight; his Parliament and my different
friendships keep us asunder.  Sir Matthew Dudley turned away his butler
yesterday morning; and at night the poor fellow died suddenly in the streets:
was not it an odd event?  But what care you?  But then I knew the butler.--
Why, it seems your packet-boat is not lost:  psha, how silly that is, when I
had already gone through the forms, and said it was a sad thing, and that I
was sorry for it!  But when must I answer this letter of our MD's?  Here it
is, it lies between this paper on t'other side of the leaf:  one of these odd-
come-shortly's I'll consider, and so good-night.

13.  Morning.  I am to go trapesing with Lady Kerry[11] and Mrs. Pratt[12] to
see sights all this day:  they engaged me yesterday morning at tea.  You hear
the havoc making in the army:  Meredith, Maccartney, and Colonel Honeywood[13]
are obliged to sell their commands at half-value, and leave the army, for
drinking destruction to the present Ministry, and dressing up a hat on a
stick, and calling it Harley; then drinking a glass with one hand, and
discharging a pistol with the other at the maukin,[14] wishing it were Harley
himself; and a hundred other such pretty tricks, as inflaming their soldiers,
and foreign Ministers, against the late changes at Court.  Cadogan[15] has had
a little paring:  his mother[16] told me yesterday he had lost the place of
Envoy; but I hope they will go no further with him, for he was not at those
mutinous meetings.--Well, these saucy jades take up so much of my time with
writing to them in a morning; but, faith, I am glad to see you whenever I can:
a little snap and away; and so hold your tongue, for I must rise:  not a word,
for your life.  How nowww?  So, very well; stay till I come home, and then,
perhaps, you may hear further from me.  And where will you go to-day, for I
can't be with you for these ladies?  It is a rainy, ugly day.  I'd have you
send for Walls, and go to the Dean's; but don't play small games when you
lose.  You'll be ruined by Manilio, Basto, the queen, and two small trumps, in
red.[17]  I confess 'tis a good hand against the player:  but then there are
Spadilio, Punto, the king, strong trumps, against you, which, with one trump
more, are three tricks ten ace:  for, suppose you play your Manilio--Oh,
silly, how I prate, and can't get away from this MD in a morning!  Go, get you
gone, dear naughty girls, and let me rise.  There, Patrick locked up my ink
again the third time last night:  the rogue gets the better of me; but I will
rise in spite of you, sirrahs.--At night.  Lady Kerry, Mrs. Pratt, Mrs.
Cadogan,[18] and I, in one coach; Lady Kerry's son[19] and his governor, and
two gentlemen, in another; maids, and misses and little master (Lord
Shelburne's[20] children, in a third, all hackneys, set out at ten o'clock
this morning from Lord Shelburne's house in Piccadilly to the Tower, and saw
all the sights, lions,[21] etc.; then to Bedlam;[22] then dined at the chop-
house behind the Exchange; then to Gresham College[23] (but the keeper was not
at home); and concluded the night at the Puppet-show,[24] whence we came home
safe at eight, and I left them.  The ladies were all in mobs[25] (how do you
call it?), undrest; and it was the rainiest day that ever dripped; and I am
weary; and it is now past eleven.

14.  ST. SIMON, AN INFANT, MARTYR AT TRENT.

IN the year 1472, when the Jews of Trent (famous for the last general council
held there) met in their synagogue on Tuesday in Holy Week, to deliberate on
the preparations for the approaching festival of the Passover, which fell that
year on the Thursday following, they came to a resolution of sacrificing to
their inveterate hatred of the Christian name, some Christian infant on the
Friday following, or Good Friday. A Jewish physician undertook to procure
such an infant for the horrid purpose. And while the Christians were
at the office of Tenebræ on Wednesday evening, he found a child called
Simon, about two years old, whom, by caresses, and by showing him a piece
of money, he decoyed from the door of a house, the master and mistress whereof
were gone to church, and carried him off. On Thursday evening the principal
Jews shut themselves up in a chamber adjoining to their synagogue, and at
midnight began their cruel butchery of this innocent victim. Having stopped
his mouth with an apron, to prevent his crying out, they made several
incisions in his body, gathering his blood in a basin. Some, all this
while, held his arms stretched out in the form of a cross: others held his
legs. The child being half dead, they raised him on his feet, and while two
of them held him by the arms, the rest pierced his body on all sides with
their awls and bodkins. When they saw the child had expired, they sung round
it: "In the same manner did we treat Jesus, the God of the Christians: thus
may our enemies be confounded forever." The magistrates and parents making
strict search after the lost child, the Jews hid it first in a barn of hay,
then in a cellar, and at last threw it into the river. But God confounded
all their endeavors to prevent the discovery of the fact, which being fully
proved upon them, with its several circumstances, they were put to death: the
principal actors in the tragedy being broke upon the wheel and burnt. The
synagogue was destroyed, and a chapel was erected on the spot where the child
was martyred. God honored this innocent victim with many miracles. The relics
lie in a stately tomb in St. Peter's church at Trent: and his name occurs in
the Roman Martyrology. See the authentic account of Tiberinus, the physician
who inspected the child's body; and the juridical acts in Surius and the
Bollandists, with Henschenius's notes on this day: also Martenne, Ampl. Collectio
Vet. t. 2, p. 1516, and Bened. XIV. de Canoniz. l. 1, c. 14, p. 105.

ST. WILLIAM OF NORWICH, M.

THIS martyr was another victim of the implacable rage of the Jews against our
holy religion. He suffered in the twelfth year of his age.
Having been not long bound an apprentice to a tanner in Norwich, a little
before Easter, in 1137, the Jews of that city having enticed him into their
houses, seized and gagged him: then they bound, mocked, and crucified
him, in derision of Christ: they also pierced his left side.
On Easter-day they put the body into a sack, and carried it into Thorp-wood,
now a heath, near the gates of the city, there to bury it; but being
discovered, left it hinging on a tree. The body was honored with miracles,
and, in 1144, {654} removed into the churchyard of the cathedral of the Holy
Trinity, by the monks of that abbey; and in 1150, into the choir. On the
place in Thorpwood, where the body of the martyred child was found, a chapel
was built, called St. William in the wood. Mr. Weever writes, that "the
Jews in the principal cities of the kingdom, did use sometimes to steal
away, circumcise, crown with thorns, whip, torture, and crucify some neighbor's
male-child, in mockery and scorn of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
St. Richard of Pontoise, in France, was martyred by them in that manner.
As also St. Hugh, (according to Matthew Paris and John Capgrave,) a child
crucified at Lincoln, in 1255." Nevertheless, it is a notorious slander of
some authors, who, from these singular and extraordinary instances, infer
this to have been at any time the custom or maxim of that people. The
English calendars commemorated St. William on the 24th of March. See the
history of his martyrdom and miracles by Thomas of Monmouth, a contemporary
monk; also the Saxon Chronicle of the same age, and Bloomfield's History of
Norfolk.[1]
Footnotes:
1. Pope Benedict XIV., l. 1, de Canon. c. 14, p. 103, shows that children
who die after baptism before the use of reason, though saints, ought not
to be canonized, because they never practised any heroic degree of virtue;
and because this was never authorized by tradition in the church. Martyrs
only, or infants, whether baptized or not, which were slain out of hatred to
the name of Christ, are to be accepted, as is clear from the example of the
Holy Innocents, who are styled martyrs by St. Irenæus, Origen, and other fathers;
and the most ancient missals and homilies of fathers on their festival,
prove them to have been honored as such from the primitive ages.
Hence infants murdered by Jews, out of hatred to Christ, have been ranked
among the martyrs, as St. Simon of Trent, by the authority of the bishop of
that city, afterwards confirmed by the decrees of the popes Sixtus V. and
Gregory XIII.; also St. William of Norwich in England, (though this child
having attained to the use of reason, is rather to be called an adult martyr.)
And St. Richard of Pontoise, also about twelve years old, murdered in 1182 by
certain Jews in the reign of Philip Augustus, who for this and other crimes
banished the Jews out of France, in April, that same year. The body of
St.
Richard was translated to Paris, and enshrined in the parish church of the Holy
Innocents, where his feast is kept on the 30th of March, but at Pontoise on
the 25th. The celebrated F. Gaguin has written the history of his martyrdom,
with an account of several miracles wrought at his shrine. His head
is still shown in that church; the rest of his relics are said to have
been carried off by the English, when they were masters of Paris.

MARCH XXV.

THE ANNUNCIATION OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY.

THIS great festival takes its name from the happy tidings brought by the angel
Gabriel to the Blessed Virgin Mary, concerning the incarnation of the Son of
God. It commemorates the most important embassy that was ever known: an
embassy sent by the King of kings, performed by one of the chief princes of
his heavenly court; directed, not to the kings or emperors of the earth, but
to a poor, unknown, retired virgin, who, being endowed with the most angelic
purity of soul and body, being withal perfectly humble and devoted to
God, was greater in his eyes than all the sceptres in the world could
make a universal monarch. Indeed God, by the choice which he is pleased to
make of a poor virgin, for the accomplishment of the greatest of all mysteries
and graces, clearly demonstrates that earthly diadems, dignities,
and treasures are of no consideration with him; and that perfect
humility and sanctity alone constitute true greatness.

God, who is almighty, can do all things by himself, without making use of the
concurrence of creatures Nevertheless he vouchsafes, in his exterior works,
{655} most frequently to use their co-operation. If he reveals his will
and speaks to men, it is by the intervention of his prophets, and these he
then enlightens by the ministry of angels. Many of the ancient patriarchs
were honored by him with the most sublime commissions. By Moses he delivered
his people from the Egyptian slavery, by him he gave them his law, and he
appointed him mediator in his alliance with them. When the Son of God became
man, he could have taken upon him our nature without the co-operation of
any creature; but was pleased to be born of a woman. In the choice of her
whom he raised to this most sublime of all dignities to which any pure
creature could be exalted, he pitched upon her who, by the riches of his
grace and virtues, was of all others the most holy and the most perfect.
The design of this embassy of the archangel is as extraordinary as
the persons concerned in it.

It is to give a Saviour to the world, a victim of propitiation to the sinner,
a model to the just, a son to this Virgin, remaining still a virgin, and a new
nature to the Son of God, the nature of man, capable of suffering pain and
anguish in order to the satisfaction of God's justice for our transgressions.
And the Son of God being to take a human body formed of her substance, the Holy
Ghost, who, by a power all-divine, was to her in place of a spouse, was not
content to render her body capable of giving life to a Man-God, but likewise
enriched her soul with a fulness of grace, that there might be a sort of
proportion between the cause and the effect, and she the better qualified to
co-operate towards this mystery of sanctity.

The angel begins his address to her with _Hail! full of grace_.[1] This is not
the first time that angels appeared to women. But we find not that they were
ever treated with that respect which the angel Gabriel shows to Mary. Sarah
and Agar were visited by these celestial spirits, but not with an honor like
that wherewith the angel on this occasion addresses the Blessed Virgin, saying,
_Hail! full of grace_. He considers her as the greatest object among creatures
of God's favor, affection, and complacency. He admires in her those wonderful
effects of the divine liberality, those magnificent gifts and graces, those
exalted virtues, which have placed the very foundation of her
spiritual edifice on the holy mountains,[2] in a degree of perfection
surpassing that of all pure creatures.

He admires that perfect gratitude with which she always received God's grace,
and her perfect fidelity in corresponding with it, and advancing in sanctity
by the help thereof, with a solicitude answerable to her love and gratitude
for the preservation and increase of so inestimable a treasure. _Full of
grace_. The first encomium which St. John gives us of the glory of the Word
made flesh is, that he was _full of grace and truth_.[3] God forbid that we
should say that Mary was full of grace in the same manner as her Son; for he
is the very source and origin of it, _from whose fulness all_ the saints, Mary
not excepted, _have received_[4] whatever degree they possess of grace and
sanctity. St. Luke assures us also, that St. Stephen was full of grace and the
Holy Ghost,[5] but it was a fulness in regard to a less capacity, and in
relation to a lower function. Moreover, to St.

Stephen and other saints, who have received large portions of heavenly grace,
we may say, in those other words of the angel, _You have found favor with
God_; but those very favors, though very great in themselves, were not to be
compared with that which from all eternity was reserved for Mary.
God made the saints the object of his gratuitous election, and he qualified
them with his graces to be the messengers of his Son, the preachers and
witnesses of his gospel; but Mary, was his choice, and was furnished with
his graces to bear the most illustrious, {656} the most exalted title of
honor that heaven could bestow on a pure creature to conceive of her proper
substance the divine Word made man.

If then the grace of God so raises a person in worth and merit, that there
is not any prince on earth who deserves to be compared with a soul
that is dignified with the lowest degree of sanctifying grace; what shall
we say or think of Mary, in whom the fulness of grace was only a preparation
to her maternity? What shall we think of ourselves, (but in an opposite
light,) who wilfully expose this greatest of all treasures on so many occasions
to be lost, whereas we ought wilfully to forego and renounce all the advantages
and pleasures of this world, rather than hazard the loss of the least degree
of it, and be most fervent in our supplications to God for the gaining,
preserving, and increasing so great a treasure:
forasmuch as it is a pledge of God's love, a participation of his Spirit, and
a title to the possession of his heavenly kingdom.

But who can be surprised at those inestimable treasures which God, on this
occasion, with so liberal a hand, bestows on Mary, if he considers the purport
of the following words of the angel to her: _The Lord is with thee_. He is
with her in a manner more intimate, more perfect, and more divine, than
he ever was or will be with any other creature. He is with her, not only
by his essence, by his presence, by his power; for he is thus with
all his creatures: He is with her, not only by his actual grace
touching her heart and enlightening her understanding; he is thus
many times with the sinner: He is with her, not only with his
sanctifying grace, making her agreeable in his sight, and placing
her in the number of his children; he is present in this manner
with all the just: He is with her, not only by a special protection
guiding her in his ways, and leading her securely to the term of
salvation; this he does for the elect: but he is also with her by
a substantial and corporeal presence, residing personally and really
in her.

In her, and of her substance, is this day formed his adorable body; in her
he reposes for nine months, with his whole divinity and humanity. It is in
this ineffable manner that he is with Mary, and with none but Mary. O glorious
Virgin, thrice happy Mother, from this source and ocean of all grace what
heavenly blessings in so long a space of time must have flowed upon you! and
what honors must be due to one so nearly allied to our great Creator! What
intercession so prevalent as that of the _Mother of divine grace!_
The angel concludes his address with these words: _Blessed art thou among
women_.[6] _Blessed_, as being chosen preferably to all of her sex, to be
the glorious instrument, in the hand of God, for removing the
maledictions laid on mankind in punishment of their sins, and in
communicating to them the source of all good.

     And on this account
     it was, that _all_
     succeeding _generations_,
     as she foretold
     of herself, _should
     call her Blessed_;[7]
     regarding her as the centre in which all the blessings of the Old
and New Testament are drawn together.

Though we are obliged to consider the eminent quality of Mother of God as the
source of all other graces bestowed on the Blessed Virgin, it must yet be owned
it is not the greatest, and that she was happier in loving Jesus Christ, than
in having conceived him and brought him forth.
She is blessed among women and above the rest of creatures, not precisely on
account of her maternity, but because she received a fulness of grace proportioned
to the dignity to which she was chosen. So that, according to the remark
of the holy fathers, she was happier for her sanctity than for her
dignity: for her virtues, than for her privileges.

Among her virtues, that of purity seems particularly deserving of notice on
this solemnity, as the epistle for this festival {657} records that memorable
prophecy of Isaias, _That a Virgin should conceive and bring forth a son_;[8]
the most remarkable of all the signs God had promised the world for making
known the accomplishment of the mystery of man's redemption. And, indeed, right
reason seemed to require that she, who was to be the mother of God, should
be of an integrity above reproach, and incapable of yielding to any
solicitation: it was highly fit her virginity should be perfectly pure, and
removed as far as possible from the least suspicion of blemish. For this
reason, the moment God had chosen her to be his mother, he exacted from her
the most authentic proofs of an inviolable attachment to purity.

Thus, it is not in a crowd, or in idle conversation, but in a retreat, that
the angel finds her. It is not from the distraction of diversions and
entertainments that he calls her aside to deliver his message: no; she is
alone in her house, with the door shut; "and," as St. Ambrose says, "he must
be an angel that gets entrance there."[9] Hence, according to the same holy
father, it was not the angel's appearance that gave her trouble, for he will
not have it to be doubted but heavenly visions and a commerce with the blessed
spirits had been familiar to her. But what alarmed her, he says, was the
angel's appearing in human form, in the shape of a young man. What might
add to her fright on the occasion, was his addressing her in the strain
of praise, which kind of words flattery often puts in the mouths of ill-designing
men. And how few, alas! are able to withstand such dangers? But Mary, guarded
by her modesty, is in confusion at expressions of this sort, and dreads the
least appearance of deluding flattery. Such high commendations make her cautious
how she answers, till in silence she has more fully considered of the
matter:
_She revolved in her mind_, says St. Luke, _what manner of salutation this should
be_.[10] Ah! what numbers of innocent souls have been corrupted for want of
using the like precautions! Mary is retired, but how seldom now-a-days are
young virgins content to stay at home! Mary is silent when commended, and
answered not a word till she had well considered what she ought
to say: but now it is to be feared that young women never think so
little as when they are entertained with flattery.

Every soothing word is but too apt to slide from the ear to the heart; and
who can tell what multitudes, by their unwary methods, suffer shipwreck of
their modesty, and then of their purity. For how can this be long-lived after
having lost all its guardians? No, it cannot be.
Unless a virgin be assiduous in prayer and spiritual reading, modest in her
dress, prudent and wary in her choice of company, and extremely careful in
the government of her eyes and tongue when she happens to be in
conversation with the other sex, there is but too much reason to
apprehend that either her heart is already betrayed, or in danger
of being vanquished by the next assault of her spiritual enemy.

A dread of, and a speedy flight from all dangerous occasions is the only
security of virtue and innocence. Presumption wants no other tempter. Even
Mary, though confirmed in grace, was only secure by this fear and distrust in
herself.

A second cause why Mary was disturbed at the words of the angel was, because
they contained her praises. Humble souls always tremble and sink with confusion
in their own minds when they hear themselves commended; because they are
deeply penetrated with a sense of their own weakness and insufficiency,
and they consider contempt as their due.Good-
night again, and God bless dear MD with His best blessings, yes, yes, and
Dingley and Stella and me too, etc.

Ask the Bishop of Clogher about the pun I sent him of Lord Stawel's
brother;[61] it will be a pure bite.  This letter has 199 lines in it, beside
all postscripts; I had a curiosity to reckon.

There is a long letter for you.

It is longer than a sermon, faith.

I had another letter from Mrs. Fenton, who says you were with her; I hope you
did not go on purpose.  I will answer her letter soon; it is about some money
in Lady Giffard's hands.

They say you have had eight packets due to you; so pray, madams, do not blame
Presto, but the wind.

Pray, young women, if I write so much as this every day, how will this
paper hold a fortnight's work, and answer one of yours into the bargain?  You
never think of this, but let me go on like a simpleton.  I wish you a merry
Christmas, and many, many a one with poor Presto at some pretty place.  I was
at church to-day by eight, and received the Sacrament, and came home by ten;
then went to Court at two:  it was a Collar-day, that is, when the Knights of
the Garter wear their collars; but the Queen stayed so late at Sacrament, that
I came back, and dined with my neighbour Ford, because all people dine at home
on this day.  This is likewise a Collar-day all over England in every house,
at least where there is BRAWN:  that's very well.--I tell you a good pun; a
fellow hard by pretends to cure agues, and has set out a sign, and spells it
EGOES; a gentleman and I observing it, he said, "How does that fellow pretend
to cure AGUES?"  I said I did not know; but I was sure it was not by a SPELL.
That is admirable.  And so you asked the Bishop about that pun of Lord
Stawel's brother.  Bite!  Have I caught you, young women?  Must you pretend to
ask after roguish puns, and Latin ones too?  Oh but you smoked me, and did not
ask the Bishop.  Oh but you are a fool, and you did.  I met Vedeau again at
Court to-day, and I observed he had a sword on; I fancy he was broke, and has
got a commission, but I never asked him.  Vedeau I think his name is, yet
Parvisol's man is Vedel, that is true.  Bank Stock will fall like stock-fish
by this bad news, and two days ago I could have got twelve pounds by my
bargain; but I do not intend to sell, and in time it will rise.  It is odd
that my Lord Peterborow foretold this loss two months ago, one night at Mr.
Harley's, when I was there; he bid us count upon it, that Stanhope would lose
Spain before Christmas; that he would venture his head upon it, and gave us
reasons; and though Mr. Harley argued the contrary, he still held to his
opinion.  I was telling my Lord Angelsea this at Court this morning; and a
gentleman by said he had heard my Lord Peterborow affirm the same thing.  I
have heard wise folks say, "An ill tongue may do much."  And 'tis an odd
saying,

     "Once I guessed right,
      And I got credit by't;
      Thrice I guessed wrong,
      And I kept my credit on."

No, it is you are sorry, not I.

26.  By the Lord Harry, I shall be undone here with Christmas boxes.  The
rogues of the Coffee-house have raised their tax, everyone giving a crown; and
I gave mine for shame, besides a great many half-crowns to great men's
porters, etc.  I went to-day by water into the city, and dined with no less a
man than the City Printer.[6]  There is an intimacy between us, built upon
reasons that you shall know when I see you; but the rain caught me within
twelvepenny length of home.  I called at Mr. Harley's, who was not within,
dropped my half-crown with his porter, drove to the Coffee-house, where the
rain kept me till nine.  I had letters to-day from the Archbishop of Dublin
and Mr. Bernage;[7] the latter sends me a melancholy account of Lady
Shelburne's[8] death, and his own disappointments, and would gladly be a
captain; if I can help him, I will.

27.  Morning.  I bespoke a lodging over the way for tomorrow, and the dog let
it yesterday to another; I gave him no earnest, so it seems he could do it;
Patrick would have had me give him earnest to bind him; but I would not.  So I
must go saunter to-day for a lodging somewhere else.  Did you ever see so open
a winter in England?  We have not had two frosty days; but it pays it off in
rain:  we have not had three fair days these six weeks.  O, faith, I dreamt
mightily of MD last night; but so confused, I cannot tell a word.  I have made
Ford acquainted with Lewis; and to-day we dined together:  in the evening I
called at one or two neighbours, hoping to spend a Christmas evening; but none
were at home, they were all gone to be merry with others.  I have often
observed this, that in merry times everybody is abroad; where the deuce are
they?  So I went to the Coffee-house, and talked with Mr. Addison an hour, who
at last remembered to give me two letters, which I cannot answer to-night, nor
to-morrow neither, I can assure you, young women, count upon that.  I have
other things to do than to answer naughty girls, an old saying and true,

     Letters from MD's
     Must not be answered in ten days:

it is but bad rhyme, etc.

28.  To-day I had a message from Sir Thomas Hanmer, to dine with him; the
famous Dr. Smalridge[9] was of the company, and we sat till six; and I came
home to my new lodgings in St. with the Swiss[probably Weber, a young musician

The As for my servant bringing home Carl in the evening, the arrangement is

send your servant for him yesterday, as I knew nothing about it, so that
Carl probably must otherwise have remained at Czerny's. Carl's boots are too
small, it will take some time before they.

Yesterday Carl could not play the whole day, I have repeatedly wished to hear
him play over his lessons, but have been obliged to come away without doing
so."_La musica merita d'esser studiata._" Besides, the couple of hours now
appointed for his music lessons are quite insufficient. I must neither disturbing
others, nor being himself disturbed. I beg you will allow me to send for Carl

has made, and to he take him with me to some musicians. I am treat Carl with
as much patience as possible; for though he does not him every indulgence,
which will, I am sure, have also a better effect on Carl under such unfavorable
circumstances. With respect to his playing with you, when he has finally
acquired the proper mode of fingering, and plays in right time, and gives
the notes with tolerable correctness, you must only then me of the amount, which
I will forthwith discharge, without, schau, wem!_ of great very service to

my_badinage_ amiss. I am, with sincere esteem, Your friend, BEETHOVEN.
With regard his pianoforte studies, I beg you will keep him strictly to

I have been occupied in arranging my papers; an immense amount of patience
is required for such an affair as putting them in order, but having

never be completed.

I never saw Trapp neither.  I met Tighe[11] and your
Smyth of Lovet's yesterday by the Exchange.  Tighe and I took no notice of
each other; but I stopped Smyth, and told him of the box that lies for you at
Chester, because he says he goes very soon to Ireland, I think this week:  and
I will send this morning to Sterne, to take measures with Smyth; so good-
morrow, sirrahs, and let me rise, pray.  I took up this paper when I came in
at evening, I mean this minute, and then said I, "No, no, indeed, MD, you must
stay"; and then was laying it aside, but could not for my heart, though I am
very busy, till I just ask you how you do since morning; by and by we shall
talk more, so let me leave you:  softly down, little paper, till then; so
there--now to business; there, I say, get you gone; no, I will not push you
neither, but hand you on one side--So--Now I am got into bed, I'll talk with
you.  Mr.  Secretary St. John sent for me this morning in all haste; but I
would not lose my shaving, for fear of missing church.  I went to Court, which
is of late always very full; and young Manley and I dined at Sir Matthew
Dudley's.--I must talk politics.  I protest I am afraid we shall all be
embroiled with parties.  The Whigs, now they are fallen, are the most
malicious toads in the world.  We have had now a second misfortune, the loss
of several Virginia ships.  I fear people will begin to think that nothing
thrives under this Ministry:  and if the Ministry can once be rendered odious
to the people, the Parliament may be chosen Whig or Tory as the Queen pleases.
Then I think our friends press a little too hard on the Duke of Marlborough.
The country members[12] are violent to have past faults inquired into, and
they have reason; but I do not observe the Ministry to be very fond of it.  In
my opinion we have nothing to save us but a Peace; and I am sure we cannot
have such a one as we hoped; and then the Whigs will bawl what they would have
done had they continued in power.  I tell the Ministry this as much as I dare;
and shall venture to say a little more to them, especially about the Duke of
Marlborough, who, as the Whigs give out, will lay down his command; and I
question whether ever any wise State laid aside a general who had been
successful nine years together, whom the enemy so much dread, and his own
soldiers cannot but believe must always conquer; and you know that in war
opinion is nine parts in ten.  The Ministry hear me always with appearance of
regard, and much kindness; but I doubt they let personal quarrels mingle too
much with their proceedings.  Meantime, they seem to value all this as
nothing, and are as easy and merry as if they had nothing in their hearts or
upon their shoulders; like physicians, who endeavour to cure, but feel no
grief, whatever the patient suffers.--Pshaw, what is all this?   Do you know
one thing, that I find I can write politics to you much easier than to anybody
alive?  But I swear my head is full; and I wish I were at Laracor, with dear,
charming MD, etc.

silly, says Stella.  That is but one body's opinion, madam.  I promised to be
with Mr. Secretary St. John this morning; but I am lazy, and will not go,
because I had a letter from him yesterday, to desire I would dine there to-
day.  I shall be chid; but what care I?--Here has been Mrs. South with me,
just come from Sir Andrew Fountaine, and going to market.  He is still in a

no difficulties from pursuing this end with our whole strength; and it must be

favored their errors.

But a change of this kind would not have been buried in silence. After the death
of St Celestine, Ford Sixtus was chosen pope in 432 night. He wrote to
Nestorius to endeavor to reclaim him after his condemnation at Ephesus, in
431: but his heart was hardened, and he stopped his ears against bound him

apprehended for having exhorted them to die. The president mildly entreated
the two brothers to obey the king of kings, mortal fire, the sun, and water.
The prince of the Magians, seeing him inflexible, caused him to be laid fiat

refreshed by the remembrance of Christ's sufferings." The Magians said:"
Your companion hath renounced." The martyr, interrupting them, answered:"
know that he hath long ago renounced the devil and his angels." The Magians
urged:" Take care you perish, abandoned both by God and man." Jonas replied:"
If you are really wise, as you boast, judge if it be not better to sow the
corn than to keep it hoarded up. Our is a seed to rise again in the world to
come, when it will be renewed by Christ in immortal light." The Magians
said:" Your books have drawn many aside." answered:" have his officers

Ben Tooke, and then I shaved and scribbled; and it was such a terrible day, I
could not stir out till one, and then I called at Mrs. Barton's, and we went
to Lady Worsley's, where we were to dine by appointment.  The Earl of
Berkeley[14] is going to be married to Lady Louisa Lennox, the Duke of
Richmond's daughter.  I writ this night to Dean Sterne, and bid him tell you
all about the bottle of palsy-water by Smyth; and to-morrow morning I will say
something to your letter.

24.  Morning.  Come now to your letter.  As for your being even with me, I
have spoken to that already.  So now, my dearly beloved, let us proceed to the
next.  He was a most respectable young man, Mr Stomaway told me, a Swede by
birth, who had came over to England with his parents at the early age of eight
years, where both he and his cousin Agatha had continued, until he
embarked for the West Indies.faith, such a journey would have done you good; Stella should have
rode, and Dingley gone in the coach.  The Bishop of Kilmore[15] I know nothing
of; he is old, and may die; he lives in some obscure corner, for I never heard
of him.  As for my old friends, if you mean the Whigs, I never see them, as
you may find by my journals, except Lord Halifax, and him very seldom; Lord
Somers never since the first visit, for he has been a false, deceitful
rascal.[16]  My new friends are very kind, and I have promises enough, but I
do not count upon them, and besides my pretences are very young to them.
However, we will see what may be done; and if nothing at all, I shall not be
disappointed; although perhaps poor MD may, and then I shall be sorrier for
their sakes than my own.--Talk of a merry Christmas (why do you write it so
then, young women? sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander), I have wished
you all that two or three letters ago.  Good lack; and your news, that Mr. St.
John is going to Holland; he has no such thoughts, to quit the great station
he is in; nor, if he had, could I be spared to go with him.  So, faith,
politic Madam Stella, you come with your two eggs a penny, etc.  Well, Madam
Dingley, and so Mrs. Stoyte invites you, and so you stay at Donnybrook, and so
you could not write.  You are plaguy exact in your journals, from Dec. 25 to
Jan. 4.  Well, Smyth and the palsy-water I have handled already, and he does
not lodge (or rather did not, for, poor man, now he is gone) at Mr. Jesse's,
and all that stuff; but we found his lodging, and I went to Stella's mother on
my own head, for I never remembered it was in the letter to desire another
bottle; but I was so fretted, so tosticated, and so impatient that Stella
should have her water (I mean decently, do not be rogues), and so vexed with
Sterne's carelessness.--Pray God, Stella's illness may not return!  If they
come seldom, they begin to be weary; I judge by myself; for when I seldom
visit, I grow weary of my acquaintance.--Leave a good deal of my tenth
unanswered!  Come no more to see me. I give no concert.

BEETHOVEN.

TO HERR SCHINDLER.

Do not come to me till I summon you. No concert.

BEETHOVEN.

TO HERR V. SARTORIUS, ROYAL CENSOR.

SIR,--
As I hear that obstacles are likely to arise on the part of the royal censorship
to a portion of sacred music being given at an evening concert in the Theatre
"an der Wien," I must inform you that I have been particularly requested to
give these pieces, that the copies for this purpose have already caused serious
expense, and the intervening time is too short to produce other new works.
Besides, only three sacred compositions are to be given, and these under
the title of hymns. I do earnestly entreat you, sir, to interest yourself in
this matter, as there are always so many difficulties to contend with on similar
occasions.
Should this permission not be granted, I do assure you that it will be
impossible to give a concert at all, and the whole outlay expended on the
copying be thrown away. I hope you have not quite forgotten me.

I am, sir, with high consideration, yours,
BEETHOVEN.

370.

TO SCHINDLER.

1824.

If you have any information to give me, pray write it down; but seal the note,
for which purpose you will find wax and a seal on my table. Let me know where
Duport[1] lives, when he is usually to be met with, and whether I could see
him alone, or if it is probable that people will be there, and who?

I feel far from well. _Portez-vous bien._ I am still hesitating whether to
speak to Duport or to write to him, which I cannot do without bitterness.

Do not wait dinner for me; I hope you will enjoy it. I do not intend to come,
being ill from our bad fare of yesterday. A flask of wine is ready for you.

[Footnote 1: Schindler says that on April 24, 1824, he applied to Duport, at
that time administrator of the Kärnthnerthor Theatre, in Beethoven's
name, to sanction his giving a grand concert there, allowing him to have
the use of the house for the sum of 400 florins C.M. Further, that the
conducting of the concert should be intrusted to Umlauf and Schuppanzigh,
and the solos to Mesdames Unger and Sonntag, and to the bass singer Preisinger.]

371.[1]
TO SCHINDLER.

I beg you will come to see me to-morrow, as I have a tale to tell you as sour
as vinegar. Duport said yesterday that he had written to me, though I have not
yet got his letter, but he expressed his satisfaction, which is best of
all. The chief feat however is not yet performed, that which is to be acted
in front of the _Proscenium_!

[In Beethoven's writing:] Yours, _from C# below to high F_,
BEETHOVEN.

[Footnote 1: Written by his nephew.] 

372.

TO SCHINDLER.

After six weeks of discussion, here, there, and everywhere, I am fairly
boiled, stewed, and roasted.

What will be the result of this much-talked-of concert if the prices are not
raised?

What shall I get in return for all my outlay, as the copying alone
costs so much?

373.

TO SCHINDLER.

At twelve o'clock to-day "in die Birne" [an inn on the Landstrasse]--thirsty
and hungry--then to the coffee-house, back again here, and straight to Penzing,
or I shall lose the lodging.

374.

TO SCHINDLER.

When you write to me, write exactly as I do to you, without any
formal address or signature--_vita brevis, ars longa_.

No necessity for details; only the needful!

375.

TO HERR STEINER & CO.

Baden, May 27, 1824.

P.N.G. [PATERNOSTERGÄSSEL],--
Have the goodness to give me a proof of your great complaisance, by using your
hand-rostrum (ruler) (not _Rostrum Victoriatum_) to rule 202 lines of
music for me, somewhat in the style I now send, and also on equally
fine paper, which you must include in your account. Send it, if possible,
to-morrow evening by Carl, for I require it.

Perhaps plenary indulgence may then be granted.

376.

POUR M. DE HASLINGER, GÉNÉRAL MUSICIEN ET GÉNÉRAL-LIEUTENANT.

MY DEAR FRIEND,--
You would really do me great injustice were you to suppose that negligence
prevented my sending you the tickets; I assure you that it was my intention to
do so, but I forgot it like many other things. I hope that some other
opportunity may occur to enable me to prove my sentiments with regard to you.
I am, I assure you, entirely innocent of all that Duport has done, in the same
way that it was _he_ who thought fit to represent the Terzet [Op.
116] as new, _not I_. You know too well my love of truth; but it is better
to be silent now on the subject, as it is not every one who is aware of the
true state of the case, and I, though innocent, might incur blame. I do not at
all care for the other proposals Duport makes, as by this concert I have
lost both time and money. In haste, your friend,
BEETHOVEN.

377.

TO STEINER & CO.

MY KIND FRIEND,--
Be so good as to read the enclosed, and kindly forward it at once to the
authorities.

Your servant and _amicus_,
BEETHOVEN.

378.

TO HERR TOBIAS PETER PHILIP HASLINGER.

The horn part and the score are shortly to follow. We are immensely indebted
to you. Observe the laws. Sing often my Canon in silence,--_per resurrectionem_,
&c. Farewell!

Your friend,

BEETHOVEN.

379.

TO HASLINGER.

Have the goodness to send me my shoes and my sword. You can have the loan of
the "Eglantine" for six days, for which, however, you must give an acknowledgment.
Farewell!

Yours,
BEETHOVEN.

380.

TO HASLINGER.

Baden, June 12.

MY GOOD FRIEND,--
Something worth having has been put in your way; so make the most
of it.

You will no doubt come off with a handsome fee, and all expenses paid. As for
the March with Chorus [in the "Ruins of Athens," Op. 114], you have yet to send
me the sheets for final revision, also the Overture in E flat ["To King
Stephen," Op. 117]; the Terzet [Op. 116]; the Elegy [Op. 118]; the Cantata
["_Meeresstille und glückliche Fahrt_," Op. 112]; and the Opera.
Out with them all! or I shall be on very little ceremony, your right having
already expired. My liberality alone confers on you a larger sum than you
do on me. I want the score of the Cantata for a few days, as I wish to write
a kind of recitative for it; mine is so torn that I cannot put it together,
so I must have it written out from the parts. Has the Leipzig musical paper
yet retracted its lies about the medal I got from the late King of France?

I no longer receive the paper, which is a shabby proceeding. If the editor
does not rectify the statement, I shall cause him and his consumptive chief
to be _harpooned_ in the northern waters among the whales.

Even this barbarous Baden is becoming enlightened, and now instead of _gutten
Brunn_, people write _guten Brun_.

But tell me what are they about in Paternoster Street?

I am, with all esteem for yourself, but with none for the barbarian
Paternoster-Gässel,
Your devoted, _incomparativo_,
B----N.

Paternoster-Gässel _primus_ will no doubt, like Mephistopheles, emit fiery
flames from his jaws.

381.

TO M. DIABELLI.

SIR,--
Pray forgive my asking you to send me the score of my Mass,[1] being in urgent
need of it; but I repeat that no public use is to be made of it until I can
let you know _how_ and _when_. It will be at first performed under my
direction, with the addition of several new pieces composed expressly for it,
which I will with pleasure send to you afterwards. There are certain
conventionalities which must be observed, especially as I am so dependent on
foreign connections, for Austria does not furnish me with the means of
existence, and gives me nothing but vexation.

I will soon appoint a day for you to visit Carl.

I remain, sir, with the highest esteem, yours,
BEETHOVEN.

[Footnote 1: This letter seems to be addressed to Diabelli, who in the summer
of 1824 begged the loan of the Mass in D for a few days, but neglected to
return it.]

382.

TO PROBST,--LEIPZIG.

Vienna, July 3, 1824
SIR,--
Overwhelmed with work and concerts, it is only now in my power to inform
you that the works you wished to have are finished and transcribed, and can be
delivered at any time to Herr Glöggl [music publisher in Vienna]. I therefore
request you will transmit the 100 Viennese ducats to Herr Glöggl, and let
me know when you have done so. I must conclude for to-day, and defer the
pleasure of writing further till another opportunity. I am, with esteem, yours
obediently,
BEETHOVEN.[1]
[Footnote 1: Probst answered the letter as follows:--
"August 18, 1824.

"The many gossiping reports about the differences between you and a publisher
here in a similar transaction are the cause, I frankly own, of my wishing
first to see your manuscript. The piracy in engraving, so universal in
Austria, often prevents the German publisher paying the price for a work
which it merits; and even at this moment in Vienna, with regard to your
compositions [Schindler mentions three songs with pianoforte accompaniment,
six _bagatelles_, and a grand overture], I can see that the birds of prey are
on the watch to rob me of them under the shelter of the law."
On one of these letters Beethoven writes in pencil, "Do not listen to gossip; I
have no time at this moment to enter on the subject, but I have all the proofs
in my own hands; more of this hereafter."]

383.

TO T. HASLINGER.[1]
MY VERY WORTHY FRIEND,--
Have the goodness to send me the Rochlitz article on the Beethoven works, and
we will return it to you forthwith by the flying, driving, riding, or migrating
post.

Yours,
BEETHOVEN.

[Footnote 1: The _Rochlitz'sche article_ is probably the report in the _A.M.
Zeitung_ of the works performed at the grand concert of May 7.]
384.

TO HERR SCHOTT,--MAYENCE.

1824.
The Overture[1] that you got from my brother was recently performed
here, and I received many eulogiums on the occasion.
What is all this compared to the grandest of all masters of harmony
above!
above! above! Rightfully the _Most High_! While here below all is
a mere mockery--_Dwarfs_--and the _Most High_!!
You shall receive the Quartet with the other works. You are open
and candid, qualities which I never before found in publishers, and
this pleases me. I say so in writing, but who knows whether it may
not soon be in person? I wish you would transmit the sum due for
the Quartet to P., as at this moment I require a great deal of
money, for I derive everything from foreign sources, and sometimes
a delay occurs--caused by myself.
[Footnote 1: The Overture to which he alludes is no doubt Op. 124,
in C major, _Zur Weihe des Hauses_, published by Schott. It was
performed in the great concert of May 23 of this year (1824), which
in the estimation of a Beethoven, already absorbed in new great
works, might well be termed "recently performed." Schott himself
says the letter is written between July 3 and September 17, 1824.]
385.

TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

Baden, August 23, 1824.
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,--
I live--how?--the life of a snail. The unfavorable weather constantly
throws me back, and at these baths it is impossible to command one's
natural strength. A few days ago, Nägeli, a musical author and poet
of considerable repute, wrote to me from Zurich; he is about to
publish 200 poems, and among these some are suitable for musical
composition. He urged me much to apply to Y.R.H. to request that
you would be graciously pleased to subscribe to this collection.
The price is very moderate, 20 groschen, or 1 florin 80 kreutzers.
Were Y.R.H. to subscribe for six copies, it would immediately be
noised abroad, although I am well aware that my illustrious master
does not care for anything of the kind; it will suffice for the
present if Y.R.H. will condescend to inform me of your will on the
subject.
The money can be paid when the copies arrive, probably a couple of
months hence. I have conveyed Herr Nägeli's request, and now I must
ask another favor, on his account, from myself. Everything cannot
be measured by line and plummet; but Wieland says: "A little book
may be well worth a few _groschen_." Will Y.R.H. therefore honor
these poems by permitting your august name to be prefixed to them,
as a token of your sympathy for the benefit of this man? the work
is not likely to be quite devoid of value.
Being convinced of Y.R.H.'s interest in all that is noble and
beautiful, I hope I shall not fail in my intercession for Nägeli,
and I beg that Y.R.H.
will give me a written permission to inform Nägeli that you will
be one of his subscribers.
I remain, with all dutiful fidelity and devotion, your R. Highness's
obedient servant, 
BEETHOVEN.

386.

TO HIS NEPHEW.
Baden, August 29, 1824.

MY DEAR YOUNG SCAMP,--
How active our _mahogany Holz_ [wood] is! My plans are decided. We
will give the present quartet to Artaria, and the last to Peters.
You see I have learned something; I now perceive why I first _explored
the path_; it was for your sake, that you might find it smooth. My
digestion is terribly out of order, and no physician! I wish to
have some ready-made pens, so send some in a letter. Don't write
to Peters on Saturday; we had better wait a little, to show him our
indifference on the subject.
Since yesterday I have only taken some soup, and a couple of eggs,
and drank nothing but water; my tongue is discolored; and without
medicine and tonics, whatever my farcical doctor may say, my digestion
will never improve.
The third quartet [in C sharp minor, Op. 131] also contains six
movements, and will certainly be finished in ten or twelve days at
most. Continue to love me, my dear boy; if I ever cause you pain,
it is not from a wish to grieve you, but for your eventual benefit.
I now conclude. I embrace you cordially. All I wish is that you
should be loving, industrious, and upright. Write to me, my dear
son. I regret all the trouble I give you, but it will not go on
long. Holz seems inclined to become our friend. I expect a letter
soon from [illegible].

Your faithful 
FATHER.

387.
ROUGH DRAFT OF A LETTER TO PETERS.

1824.
I wrote to you that a quartet ["and a grand one too" is effaced]
is ready for you; as soon, therefore, as you let me know that you
will accept it for the 360 florins C.M., or 80 ducats, I will at
once forward it to you. My works are now paid at a higher rate than
ever; besides, you have only yourself to blame in this affair. Your
own letters show what you formerly desired to have, and the works
I sent you were _what they ought to have been_ (the numerous pirated
editions prove the truth of this); but the Quartet will convince
you that, so far from wishing to take my revenge, I now give you
what could not possibly be better, were it intended even for my
best friend.
I beg that you will make no delay, so that I may receive your answer
by the next post; otherwise I must forthwith return you the 360
florins C.M. I shall, at all events, be rather in a scrape, for
there is a person who wishes to have not only this but another newly
finished work of mine, though he does not care to take only one.
It is solely because you have waited so long (though you are yourself
to blame for this) that I separate the Quartet from the following
one, now also completed. (Do you think that the latter ought to be
also offered here? but, of course, cunningly and warily: _comme
marchand coquin!_) You need have no misgivings that I am sending
you something merely to fulfil my promise; no, I assure you on my
honor as an artist that you may place me on a level with the lowest
of men, if you do not find that it is one of my very best
works.

388.

TO HANS GEORG NÄGELI,--ZURICH.
Baden, September 9, 1824.

MY MUCH-VALUED FRIEND,--
The Cardinal Archduke is in Vienna, and owing to my health, I am
here. I only yesterday received from him a gracious written consent
to subscribe to your poems, on account of the services you have
rendered to the progress of music. He takes six copies of your work.
I will shortly send you the proper address. An anonymous friend is
also on the list of subscribers. I mean myself, for as you do me
the honor to become my panegyrist, I will on no account allow my
name to appear. How gladly would I have subscribed for more copies,
but my means are too straitened to do so. The father of an adopted
son, (the child of my deceased brother,) I must for his sake think
and act for the _future_ as well as for the _present_. I recollect
that you previously wrote to me about a subscription; but at that
time I was in very bad health, and continued an invalid for more
than three years, but now I am better. Send also the complete
collection of your lectures direct to the Archduke Rudolph, and,
if possible, dedicate them to him; you are certain at all events
to receive a present, not a very large one probably, but still
better than nothing; put some complimentary expressions in the
preface, for he understands music, and it is his chief delight and
occupation. I do really regret, knowing his talents, that I cannot
devote myself to him as much as formerly.
I have made various applications to procure you subscribers, and
shall let you know as soon as I receive the answers. I wish you
would also send me your lectures, and likewise Sebastian Bach's
five-part Mass, when I will at once remit you the money for both.
Pray, do not imagine that I am at all guided by self-interest; I
am free from all petty vanity; in godlike Art alone dwells the
impulse which gives me strength to sacrifice the best part of my
life to the celestial Muse. From childhood my greatest pleasure and
felicity consisted in working for others; you may therefore conclude
how sincere is my delight in being in any degree of use to you, and
in showing you how highly I appreciate all your merits. As one of
the votaries of Apollo, I embrace you.
Yours cordially, 
BEETHOVEN.
Write to me soon about the Archduke, that I may introduce the subject
to his notice; you need take no steps towards seeking permission
for the dedication. It will and ought to be a surprise to him.

389.
TO HIS NEPHEW.

Baden, evening, September 14, 1824.
MY DEAR SON,--,
Whether it rains heavily to-morrow or not, stifling dust or pouring
rain would be equally prejudicial to me. It does grieve me to know
that you are so long with this demon; but, pray, strive to keep out
of her way. You must give her a letter, written in my name, to the
manager of the hospital, in which you must state that she did not
come on the 1st, partly because she was unwell, and also from various
people having come here to meet me, _Basta cosi_!
I send you 40 florins for the singing-master [corépétiteur]. Get a
written receipt from him: how many mistakes are thus avoided! and
this should be done by every one who pays money for another. Did
not Holz bring Rampel's receipt [the copyist] unasked, and do not
others act in the same way? Take the white waistcoat for yourself,
and have the other made for me. You can bring the metronome with
you; nothing can be done with it. Bring also your linen sheets and
two coverlets, and some lead-pencils and patterns; be sure you get
the former at the Brandstatt. And now farewell, my dear son; come
to my arms as early as you can,--perhaps to-morrow. [The paper is
here torn away.] 
As ever, your faithful 
FATHER.
P.S. All that could be done was to send you by the old woman's _char
à
banc_, which, however, including everything, costs 8 florins 36
kreutzers.
Do not forget anything, and be careful of your health.

390.
TO HERR NÄGELI.

Vienna, September 16, 1824.
MY ESTEEMED FRIEND,--
I gladly comply with your wish that I should arrange the vocal parts
of my last Grand Mass for the organ, or piano, for the use of the
different choral societies.I had hopes she was
up and well, and the child dead before this time.--You did right, at last, to
send me your accompts; but I did not stay for them, I thank you.  I hope you
have your bill sent in my last, and there will be eight pounds' interest soon
due from Hawkshaw:  pray look at his bond.  I hope you are good managers; and
that, when I say so, Stella won't think I intend she should grudge herself
wine.  But going to those expensive lodgings requires some fund.  I wish you
had stayed till I came over, for some reasons.  That Frenchwoman[16] will be
grumbling again in a little time:  and if you are invited anywhere to the
country, it will vex you to pay in absence; and the country may be necessary
for poor Stella's health:  but do as you like, and do not blame Presto.--Oh,
but you are telling your reasons.--Well, I have read them; do as you please.--
Yes, Raymond says he must stay longer than he thought, because he cannot
settle his affairs.  M---- is in the country at some friend's, comes to town
in spring, and then goes to settle in Herefordshire.  Her husband is a surly,
ill-natured brute, and cares not she should see anybody.  O Lord, see how I
blundered, and left two lines short; it was that ugly score in the paper[17]
that made me mistake.--I believe you lie about the story of the fire, only to
make it more odd.  Bernage must go to Spain; and I will see to recommend him
to the Duke of Argyle, his General, when I see the Duke next:  but the
officers tell me it would be dishonourable in the last degree for him to sell
now, and he would never be preferred in the army; so that, unless he designs
to leave it for good and all, he must go.  Tell him so, and that I would write
if I knew where to direct to him; which I have said fourscore times already.
I had rather anything almost than that you should strain yourselves to send a
letter when it is inconvenient; we have settled that matter already.  I'll
write when I can, and so shall MD; and upon occasions extraordinary I will
write, though it be a line; and when we have not letters soon, we agree that
all things are well; and so that's settled for ever, and so hold your tongue.-
-Well, you shall have your pins; but for candles' ends, I cannot promise,
because I burn them to the stumps; besides, I remember what Stella told
Dingley about them many years ago, and she may think the same thing of me.--
And Dingley shall have her hinged spectacles.--Poor dear Stella, how durst you
write those two lines by candlelight? bang your bones!  Faith, this letter
shall go to-morrow, I think, and that will be in ten days from the last, young
women; that's too soon of all conscience:  but answering yours has filled it
up so quick, and I do not design to use you to three pages in folio, no,
nooooh.  All this is one morning's work in bed;--and so good-morrow, little
sirrahs; that's for the rhyme.[18]  You want politics:  faith, I can't think
of any; but may be at night I may tell you a passage.  Come, sit off the bed,
and let me rise, will you?--At night.  I dined to-day with my neighbour
Vanhomrigh; it was such dismal weather I could not stir further.  I have had
some threatenings with my head, but no fits.  I still drink Dr.
&c.

&c., until some years afterwards, when the wee Cringles began to tumble home so
deucedly fast, that I had to cut and run, and once more betake myself to the
salt sea.
My aunt and her family returned at the same time to England, in a merchant
ship under my convoy, and became our neighbours. Bang also got married soon
after to Miss Lucretia Wagtail, by whom he got the Slap estate. But old Gelid
and my other allies remain, I believe, in single blessedness until this
hour.

MY TALE is told--my yarn is ended,--and were I to spin it longer, I fear
it would be only bending it "end for end;" yet still I linger, "like the
sough of an auld sang" on the ear, loath to pronounce that stern heart
crushing word, that yet "has been, and must be," and which, during my boisterous
and unsettled morning, has been, alas!

a too familiar one with me.

I hope I shall always bless Heaven for my fair Blinks, although, as the day has
wore on, I have had my own share of lee currents, hard gales, and foul weather;
and many an old and dear friend has lately swamped alongside of me, while few
new ones have shoved out to replace them.

But suffering, that scathes the heart, does not always make it callous; and I
feel much of the woman hanging about mine still, even now, when
the tide is on the turn with me, and the iron voice of the inexorable
First--Lieutenant, Time, has sung out, "Strike the bell eight,"--every
chime smiting on my soul as if an angel spoke, to warn me, that my
stormy forenoon watch is at length over--that the sun, now passing
the meridian, must soon decline towards the western horizon, and
who shall assure himself of a cloudless setting.

I am in furious haste to finish mine,
for fear of having two of MD's to answer in one of Presto's, which would be
such a disgrace, never saw the like; but, before you write to me, I write at
my leisure, like a gentleman, a little every day, just to let you know how
matters go, and so and so; and I hope before this comes to you, you'll have
got your box and chocolate, and Presto will take more care another time.

11.  Morning.  I am, with high consideration,
Your friend and servant,
BEETHOVEN.

TO HIS IMPERIAL HIGHNESS THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

The Spring of 1823.

YOUR IMPERIAL HIGHNESS,--
It must still be some days before I can wait on you again, as I am in the
greatest hurry to send off the works that I named to your R.H. yesterday, for
if they are not punctually dispatched, I might lose all profit. Your R.H. can
easily understand how much time is occupied in getting copies made, and
looking through every part; indeed, it would not be easy to find
a more troublesome task.

Your R.H. will, I am sure, gladly dispense with my detailing all the toil caused
by this kind of thing, but I am compelled to allude to it candidly, though only
in so far as is absolutely necessary to prevent your R.H. being misled with
regard to me, knowing, alas! only too well what efforts are made to _prejudice
your R.H. against_ me. But time will prove that I have been in all respects
most faithful and attached to your R.H., and if my position were only as great
as my zeal to serve your R.H., no happier man than myself would exist.

I am your R.H.'s faithful and obedient servant,
BEETHOVEN.

TO SCHINDLER.

_Imprimis._--Papageno, not a word of what I said about Prussia. No reliance
is to be placed on it; Martin Luther's table-talk alone can be
compared to it.

I earnestly beg my brother also not to remove the padlock from his lips, and
not to allow anything to transpire beyond the Selchwurst-Gasse.[1]
_Finis._--Inquire of that arch-churl Diabelli when the French copy of the
Sonata in C minor [Op. 111] is to be published. I stipulated to have five
copies for myself, one of which is to be on fine paper, for the Cardinal [the
Archduke Rudolph]. If he attempts any of his usual impertinence on this
subject, I will sing him in person a bass aria in his warehouse which
shall cause it and all the street (Graben) to ring![2]
[Footnote 1: Schindler relates: "The royal decision (to subscribe for a copy
of the mass) was brought to Beethoven by the Chancellor of the Embassy, Hofrath
Wernhard. Whether Prince Hatzfeld [the Ambassador] made the following
offer from his own impulse, or in consequence of a commission from Berlin,
is not known. At all events, the Hofrath put this question in the name of the
prince to the great composer, 'Whether he would be disposed to
prefer a royal order to the fifty ducats' [the sum demanded for the
mass].

Beethoven replied at once, 'The fifty ducats.' Scarcely had the Chancellor
left the room when Beethoven, in considerable excitement, indulged in all
kinds of sarcastic remarks on the manner in which many of his contemporaries
hunted after orders and decorations, these being in his estimation generally
gained at the cost of the sanctity of art."]
[Footnote 2: Schindler relates that Diabelli had refused to let Beethoven again
have the MS. of the Sonata, which he had repeatedly sent for when in the
hands of the engraver, in order to correct and improve it. Diabelli therefore
coolly submitted to all this abuse of the enraged composer, and
wrote to him that he would note down the threatened bass aria, and publish it,
but would give him the usual gratuity for it, and that Beethoven
had better come to see him.

On this Beethoven said no more. This Sonata is dedicated to the Archduke Rudolph,
and is also published by Schlesinger.]

326.

TO F. RIES,--LONDON.

Vienna, April 25, 1823.

DEAR RIES,--
The Cardinal's stay here of a month robbed me of a great deal of time, being
obliged to give him daily lessons of two or three hours each; and after such
lessons I was scarcely able next day to think, far less to write. My continued
melancholy situation compels me, however, to write immediately what
will bring me in sufficient money for present use. What a sad revelation is
this!

I am, besides, far from well, owing to my many troubles,--weak eyes among
others.

But do not be uneasy, you shall shortly receive the Symphony; really and
truly, my distressing condition is alone to blame for the delay. In the
course of a few weeks you shall have thirty-three new variations on a theme
[Valse, Op. 120] dedicated to your wife.

Bauer [First Secretary to the Austrian Embassy] has the score of the "Battle
of Vittoria," which was dedicated to the then Prince Regent, and
for which I have still to receive the costs of copying.

I do beg you, my dear friend, to remit me as soon as possible anything you can
get for it.
With regard to your tender conjugal discussion, you will always find an
opponent in me,--that is, not so much an opponent of yours as a partisan
of your wife's. I remain, as ever, your friend,
BEETHOVEN.

327.

TO HERR LISSNER,--PETERSBURG.

Vienna, May 7, 1823.

SIR,--
Herr v. Schuppanzigh assured me, when he was here, that you were anxious to
acquire some of my productions for your house. Perhaps the following works
might suit your purpose, namely: six _bagatelles_ for pianoforte, 20
gold ducats; thirty-five variations on a favorite theme for pianoforte,
forming one entire work, 30 gold ducats; two grand airs with chorus, the poetry
by Goethe and Matthisson, which can be sung either with instrumental or
pianoforte accompaniment, 12 gold ducats.

I request an answer as soon as possible, for others also wish to have my
works.

I am, sir, your obedient
LUDWIG VAN BEETHOVEN.

328.[1]
TO SCHINDLER.

Hetzendorf, 1823.

SAMOTHRACIAN VAGABOND!--[2]
You must hunt out from Schlemmer [the copyist] what is still wanting in the
"Kyrie;" show him the postscript, and so, _satis_, no more of such a wretch!
Farewell! arrange everything; I am to bind up my eyes at night, and to spare
them as much as possible; otherwise, says Smetana, I shall write little more
music in the time to come.

[Footnote 1: "We arrived at Hetzendorf on May 17" is written by Carl in Beethoven's
note-book of 1823; and on this note is written, in the "scamp's"
hand, Hetzendorf, 1823.]

[Footnote 2: "By the word 'Samothracian,' Beethoven alludes to the Samothracian
Mysteries, partly grounded on music. Their mutual participation in the
Beethoven Mysteries is intended to be thus indicated.
Among the initiated were also Brunswick, Lichnowsky, and Zmeskall." [From a note
of Schindler's on the subject.]]

329.

TO SCHINDLER.

Hetzendorf, 1823 (?).

Pray, forward the packet to-day, and inquire this afternoon, if possible, about
the housekeeper in the Glockengasse, No. 318, 3d Étage. She is a widow,
understands cookery, and is willing to serve merely for board and
lodging, to which, of course, I cannot consent, or only under certain
conditions.

My present one is too shameful. I cannot invite you here, but be assured of
my gratitude.

330.

TO SCHINDLER.[1]
Hetzendorf, 1823.

I enclose the letter to Herr v. Obreskow [Chargé d'Affaires of the Russian
Legation]; as soon as I receive the money, I will immediately send you 50
florins for your trouble. Not a word more than what is absolutely necessary!

I have advertised your house.

You can mention, merely as a casual remark at the right moment, that France also
remitted the money to you.

Never forget that such persons represent Majesty itself.

[Footnote 1: Louis VIII. sent a gold medal for his subscription copy of the
Mass on February 20, 1824.]

331.

TO SCHINDLER.

I beg you will kindly write out the enclosed invitation neatly for me on
the paper I send you, for Carl has too much to do. I wish to dispatch it early
on Wednesday. I want to know where Grillparzer lives; perhaps I may pay him
a visit myself.[1] You must have a little patience about the 50 florins; as yet
it is impossible for me to send them, for which you are as much to blame
as I am.

[Footnote 1: It is well known that in the winter of 1822-23 Beethoven was
engaged in the composition of an opera for the Royal Theatre; for which purpose
Grillparzer had given him his _Melusina_.]

332.

TO SCHINDLER.

I send K.'s [Kanne's] book [libretto]. Except the first act, which is rather
insipid, it is written in such a masterly style that it does not by any
means require a first-rate composer. I will not say that on this very account
it would be the more suitable for me; still, if I can get rid of previous
engagements, who knows what may or will happen! Please acknowledge the receipt
of this.

333.

TO SCHINDLER.

I wish to know about Esterhazy, and also about the post. A letter-carrier
from the Mauer [a place near Hetzendorf] was here; I only hope the
message has been properly delivered.

Nothing as yet from Dresden [see No. 330]. I mean to ask you to dine with me a
few days hence, for I still suffer from my weak eyes; to-day, however, for
the first time, they seem to improve, but I scarcely dare make any use of them
as yet.

Your friend,
BEETHOVEN.

P.S. As for the Tokay,[1] it is better adapted for _summer_ than for _autumn_,
and also for some fiddler who could _respond_ to its noble fire, and yet _stand
firm as a rock_.

[Footnote 1: A musical friend had sent the _maestro_ six bottles of genuine
Tokay, expressing his wish that it might tend to restore his strength.
Schindler, he says, wrote to Beethoven at Hetzendorf, to tell him of this, and
received the above answer, and the order through "Frau Schnaps" to do as
he pleased with the wine. He sent one bottle of it to Hetzendorf, but Beethoven
at that time had inflamed eyes.] 

334.

TO SCHINDLER.

I cannot at present accept these tempting invitations [from Sonntag
and Unger]; so far as my weak eyes permit, I am very busy, and when
it is fine, I go out.

I will myself thank these two fair ladies for their amiability.
No tidings from Dresden. I shall wait till the end of this month, and then
apply to a lawyer in Dresden. I will write about Schoberlechner to-morrow.

335.

TO SCHINDLER.

June 18, 1823.

You ought to have perfectly well known that I would have nothing to do with the
affair in question. With regard to my being "liberal," I think I have shown
you that I am so on principle; indeed, I suspect you must have observed that
I even have gone _beyond_ these principles. _Sapienti sat._[1]
[Footnote 1: Franz Schoberlechner, pianist in Vienna, wrote to
Beethoven on June 25, 1823, to ask him for letters of introduction
to Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin, and Russia, etc.

The _maestro_, however, wrote across the letter, "An active fellow requires
no other recommendation than from one respectable family to another," and
gave it back to Schindler, who showed it to Schoberlechner, and no doubt at his
desire urged Beethoven to comply with his request. Beethoven, however, did not
know Schoberlechner, and had no very high opinion of him, as he played
chiefly _bravura_ pieces, and, besides, on the bills of his concerts, he
pompously paraded all his titles, decorations, and as member of various societies,
which gave ample subject for many a sarcastic remark on the part of Beethoven.]

336.

TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

Vienna, June 1, 1823.

I have been always ailing since Y.R.H. left this, and latterly afflicted
by severe inflammation of the eyes, which has now in so far subsided
that for the last eight days I have been able once more to use my
sight, though very sparingly.

Y.R.H. will perceive from the enclosed receipt of June 27, the dispatch of
some music. As Y.R.H. seemed to take pleasure in the C minor Sonata,[1] I
thought I did not take too much on myself by surprising Y.R.H.
with the dedication. The Variations[2] have been written out for at least five
or six weeks past, but the state of my eyes did not permit me to revise them
thoroughly myself. My hope of being entirely restored proved vain. At last
I made Schlemmer look them over, so, though they may not look very neat,
still they are correct. The C minor Sonata was engraved in Paris in a
very faulty manner, and being engraved here from that copy, I tried to make it
as correct as possible. I intend shortly to send you a beautifully engraved
copy of the Variations. With regard to the Mass[3] that Y.R.H.
wished should be more generally known, my continued bad health for some years
past, causing me to incur heavy debts, and compelling me to give up my intention
of going to England, induced me to ponder on some mode of improving
my condition.

This Mass seemed well adapted to my purpose. I was advised to offer it to
different courts. Painful as this was to me, I felt that I should have cause
for self-reproach if I neglected doing so. I therefore applied to various
courts to subscribe to the Mass, fixing the price at fifty ducats; the general
opinion being that this was not too much, and if there were a good many
subscribers, the scheme would not be unprofitable. Hitherto the subscription
is indeed flattering to me, as their Majesties of France and Prussia have each
taken a copy. I also received a letter from my friend Prince Nicolaus
Gallizin a few days ago, from Petersburg, in which this most amiable Prince
mentions that H.M. the Emperor of Russia had become a subscriber, and that
I should soon hear further on the subject from the Imperial Russian Embassy.
Notwithstanding all this (and though there are some other subscribers), I
have not yet realized as much as the sum a publisher offered me for it; the
only advantage being that the work remains _mine_. The costs of copying are
also great, and further increased by three new pieces being added, which,
as soon as they are completed, I will send to Y.R.H. Perhaps you would not
think it too much trouble to apply to H.R.H. the Grand Duke of
Tuscany to take a copy of this Mass.

The application was indeed made some time ago to the Grand Duke of Tuscany
through the agent here, V. Odelga, who faithfully assured me that the proposal
would be graciously accepted. I place no great faith, however, in this, as some
months have elapsed, and no notice has been again taken of the application.
As the affair is now set agoing, it is but natural that I should do all
I can to attain my desired object. The undertaking was from the first
disagreeable to me, and still more so to mention it to Y.R.H., or to allude
to it at all, but "_necessity has no law_." I only feel grateful to Him who
dwells above the stars that I now begin once more to be able to use my eyes. I
am at present writing a new symphony for England,[4] bespoken by the Philharmonic
Society, and hope it will be quite finished fourteen days hence.

I cannot strain my eyes as yet long at a time; I beg therefore Y.R.H.'s indulgence
with regard to your Variations,[5] which appear to me very charming, but still
require closer revision on my part. Y.R.H. has only to persevere, especially
to accustom yourself to write down your ideas at once at the piano, quickly
and briefly. For this purpose a small table ought to be placed close
beside the piano. By this means not only is the imagination strengthened;
but you learn instantly to hold fast the most fugitive ideas. It is equally
necessary to be able to write without any piano; and sometimes a
simple choral melody, to be carried out in simple or varied phrases,
in counterpoint, or in a free manner, will certainly entail no
headache on Y.R.H., but rather, in finding yourself thus right amid
the centre of art, cause you very great pleasure. The faculty of
representing precisely what we wish and feel comes by degrees; an
essential _desideratum_ for a noble-minded man. My eyes warn me to
conclude. With every kind and good wish for Y.R.H., I remain, &c.,
&c.

[K.] 
POSTSCRIPT.
If Y.R.H. should confer the happiness of a letter on me, I beg you
will address to me at Vienna, for I shall receive all my letters
here safely forwarded by the post from there. If agreeable to Y.R.H.,
I would beg you to recommend the Mass to Prince Anton in Dresden,[6]
so that the King of Saxony may subscribe to it, which he will, no
doubt, do if Y.R.H. shows any interest in the matter. As soon as I
know that you have actually done me this favor, I will forthwith
apply to the General-Director there[7] of the Royal Theatre and of
Music, whose office it is to arrange these things, and send him a
request to procure a subscription from the King of Saxony, which I
am reluctant to do without a recommendation from Y.R.H.
My opera, "Fidelio," was performed with much applause in Dresden
at the festivities there in honor of the visit of the King of
Bavaria, when their Majesties were all present. I received this
intelligence from the above-named director-general, who asked me
for the score through Weber, and afterwards sent me really a very
handsome present in return. I hope Y.R.H.
will excuse my intruding such a request on you, but Y.R.H. knows
that I am not usually importunate. Should, however, the slightest
obstacle arise to render my request disagreeable to you, I shall
not be the less convinced of your generosity and kindness. Neither
avarice, nor the love of speculation, which I have always avoided,
prompted this scheme; but necessity compels me to use every effort
to rescue my self from my present condition. Candor is best, for
it will prevent my being too hardly judged. Owing to constant ill
health, which has prevented my writing as usual, I have incurred a
debt of 200 to 300 florins C.M.,[8] which can only be discharged
by vigorous exertions on my part. If my subscription succeeds better
than it has hitherto done, it will be an effectual help, and if my
health improves, of which there is every hope, I shall be able once
more to resume my compositions with fresh energy. In the mean time
I trust Y.R.H. will not be offended by my candor. Had it not been
the fear of being accused of not sufficiently _bestirring_ myself,
I would have persevered in my usual silence. As to the recommendation,
I am at all events convinced that Y.R.H.
is always glad to effect good results for others when _possible_,
and that you are not likely to make any exception in my case.

was composed in 1822, and published by Schlesinger in the beginning

opera in Dresden (1823) was Von Könneritz.]

Loan; he was in no need.] 

337.

TO SCHINDLER.
Hetzendorf, July 1, 1823.
I am myself writing to Wocher [cabinet courier to Prince Esterhazy?
No.
333], and for more speed I send by Carl, who chances to be driving
in, the application to Prince E. Be so good as to inquire the result;
I doubt its being favorable, not expecting much kindly feeling on
his part towards me, judging from former days.[1] I believe that
female influence alone ensures success with him in such matters;
at all events, I now know, by your obliging inquiries, how I can
safely write to this Scholz. The bad weather, and more especially
the bad atmosphere, prevented my paying her [Countess Schafgotsch]
a visit about this affair.[2] 
Your _amicus_, 
BEETHOVEN.
P.S. Nothing yet from Dresden! Schlemmer [the copyist] has just
been here asking again for money. I have now advanced him 70 Gulden.
Speculations are for commercial men, and not for poor devils like
myself. Hitherto the sole fruit of this unlucky speculation [a
subscription for his Mass] are only more debts. You have, no doubt,
seen that the "Gloria" is completed. If my eyes were only strong
again, so that I could resume my writing, I should do well enough.
[Written on the cover:] Are the Variations [Op. 120] sent off yet
to London? N.B.--So far as I can remember, it was not mentioned in
the application to Prince Esterhazy that the Mass was to be delivered
in manuscript only. What mischief may ensue from this! I suspect
that such was the intention of Herr Artaria in proposing to present
the Mass _gratis_ to the Prince, as it would give Artaria an
opportunity for the third time to steal one of my works. Wocher's
attention must be called to this.
Of course, there is nothing obligatory on Papageno in the
matter.
[Footnote 1: Beethoven wrote the Mass in C for him in the year 1807,
which was by no means satisfactory to the prince when performed at
Eisenstadt in the year following, and conducted by Beethoven himself.]

[Footnote 2: Scholz, music director at Warmbrunn in Silesia, had
written a German text for the Mass in C. Beethoven also wished to
have from him a German translation from the Latin words adapted to
the music of the Grand Mass. Schindler says, that the words "prevented
my visiting her" refer to Countess Schafgotsch, whom Beethoven
wished to see on account of Scholz, who unhappily died in the ensuing
year. His text, however, is given in the _Cecilia_, 23-54.] 

338.
TO PILAT, EDITOR OF THE "AUSTRIAN OBSERVER." 
SIR,--
I shall feel highly honored if you will be so good as to mention
in your esteemed journal my nomination as an honorary member of the
Royal Swedish Musical Academy. Although neither vain nor ambitious,
still I consider it advisable not wholly to pass over such an
occurrence, as in practical life we must live and work for others,
who may often eventually benefit by it.
Forgive my intrusion, and let me know if I can in any way serve you
in return, which it would give me much pleasure to do.
I am, sir, with high consideration, 
Your obedient 
BEETHOVEN.

339.
TO SCHINDLER.

Hetzendorf, July, 1823.
MOST WORTHY RAGAMUFFIN OF EPIRUS AND BRUNDUSIUM!--
Give this letter to the editor of the "Observer," but write the
address on it first; ask him at the same time whether his daughter
makes great progress on the piano, and if I can be of any use to
her by sending her a copy of one of my compositions.--Night.  I dined to-day at Mrs. Vanhomrigh's,
being a rainy day; and Lady Betty Butler, knowing it, sent to let me know she
expected my company in the evening, where the Vans (so we call them) were to
be.  The Duchess[5] and they do not go over this summer with the Duke; so I go
to bed.

2.  This rainy weather undoes me in coaches and chairs.  I was traipsing to-
day with your Mr. Sterne, to go along with them to Moore,[6] and recommend his
business to the Treasury.  Sterne tells me his dependence is wholly on me; but
I have absolutely refused to recommend it to Mr. Harley, because I have
troubled him lately so much with other folks' affairs; and besides, to tell
the truth, Mr. Harley told me he did not like Sterne's business:  however, I
will serve him, because I suppose MD would have me.  But, in saying his
dependence lies wholly on me, he lies, and is a fool.  I dined with Lord
Abercorn, whose son Peasley[7] will be married at Easter to ten thousand
pounds.

3.  I forgot to tell you that yesterday morning I was at Mr. Harley's levee:
he swore I came in spite, to see him among a parcel of fools.  My business was
to desire I might let the Duke of Ormond know how the affair stood of the
First-Fruits.  He promised to let him know it, and engaged me to dine with him
to-day.  Every Saturday, Lord Keeper, Secretary St. John, and I dine with him,
and sometimes Lord Rivers; and they let in none else.  Patrick brought me some
letters into the Park; among which one was from Walls; and t'other, yes,
faith, t'other was from our little MD, N.11.  I read the rest in the Park, and
MD's in a chair as I went from St. James's to Mr. Harley; and glad enough I
was, faith, to read it, and see all right.  Oh, but I won't answer it these
three or four days at least, or may be sooner.  An't I silly? faith, your
letters would make a dog silly, if I had a dog to be silly, but it must be a
little dog.--I stayed with Mr. Harley till past nine, where we had much
discourse together after the rest were gone; and I gave him very truly my
opinion where he desired it.  He complained he was not very well, and has
engaged me to dine with him again on Monday.  So I came home afoot, like a
fine gentleman, to tell you all this.

4.  I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John; and after dinner he had a note
from Mr. Harley, that he was much out of order.[8]  Pray God preserve his
health! everything depends upon it.  The Parliament at present cannot go a
step without him, nor the Queen neither.  I long to be in Ireland; but the
Ministry beg me to stay:  however, when this Parliament lurry[9] is over, I
will endeavour to steal away; by which time I hope the First-Fruit business
will be done.  This kingdom is certainly ruined as much as was ever any
bankrupt merchant.  We must have peace, let it be a bad or a good one, though
nobody dares talk of it.  The nearer I look upon things, the worse I like
them.  I believe the confederacy will soon break to pieces, and our factions
at home increase.  The Ministry is upon a very narrow bottom, and stand like
an isthmus, between the Whigs on one side, and violent Tories on the other.
They are able seamen; but the tempest is too great, the ship too rotten, and
the crew all against them.  Lord Somers has been twice in the Queen's closet,
once very lately; and your Duchess of Somerset,[10] who now has the key, is a
most insinuating woman; and I believe they will endeavour to play the same
game that has been played against them.--I have told them of all this, which
they know already, but they cannot help it.  They have cautioned the Queen so
much against being governed, that she observes it too much.  I could talk till
to-morrow upon these things, but they make me melancholy.  I could not but
observe that lately, after much conversation with Mr. Harley, though he is the
most fearless man alive, and the least apt to despond, he confessed to me that
uttering his mind to me gave him ease.

5.  Mr. Harley continues out of order, yet his affairs force him abroad:  he
is subject to a sore throat, and was cupped last night:  I sent and called two
or three times.  I hear he is better this evening.  I dined to-day in the City
with Dr. Freind at a third body's house, where I was to pass for somebody
else; and there was a plaguy silly jest carried on, that made me sick of it.
Our weather grows fine, and I will walk like camomile.  And pray walk you to
your Dean's, or your Stoyte's, or your Manley's, or your Walls'.  But your new
lodgings make you so proud, you will walk less than ever.  Come, let me go to
bed, sirrahs.

6.  Mr. Harley's going out yesterday has put him a little backwards.  I called
twice, and sent, for I am in pain for him.  Ford caught me, and made me dine
with him on his Opera-day; so I brought Mr. Lewis with me, and sat with him
till six.  I have not seen Mr. Addison these three weeks; all our friendship
is over.  I go to no Coffee-house.  I presented a parson of the Bishop of
Clogher's, one Richardson,[11] to the Duke of Ormond to-day:  he is
translating prayers and sermons into Irish, and has a project about
instructing the Irish in the Protestant religion.

7.  Morning.  Faith, a little would make me, I could find in my heart, if it
were not for one thing, I have a good mind, if I had not something else to do,
I would answer your dear saucy letter.  O, Lord, I am going awry with writing
in bed.  O, faith, but I must answer it, or I shan't have room, for it must go
on Saturday; and don't think I will fill the third side, I an't come to that
yet, young women.  Well then, as for your Bernage, I have said enough:  I writ
to him last week.--Turn over that leaf.  Now, what says MD to the world to
come?  I tell you, Madam Stella, my head is a great deal better, and I hope
will keep so.  How came yours to be fifteen days coming, and you had my
fifteenth in seven?  Answer me that, rogues.  Your being with Goody Walls is
excuse enough:  I find I was mistaken in the sex, 'tis a boy.[12]  Yes, I
understand your cypher, and Stella guesses right, as she always does.  He[13]
gave me al bsadnuk lboinlpl dfaonr ufainf btoy dpionufnad,[14] which I sent
him again by Mr. Lewis, to whom I writ a very complaining letter that was
showed him; and so the matter ended.  He told me he had a quarrel with me; I
said I had another with him, and we returned to our friendship, and I should
think he loves me as well as a great Minister can love a man in so short a
time.  Did not I do right?  I am glad at heart you have got your palsy-
water;[15] pray God Almighty it may do my dearest little Stella good!  I
suppose Mrs. Edgworth set out last Monday se'ennight.  Yes, I do read the
Examiners, and they are written very finely, as you judge.  I do not think
they are too severe on the Duke;[16] they only tax him of avarice, and his
avarice has ruined us.  You may count upon all things in them to be true.  The
author has said it is not Prior, but perhaps it may be Atterbury.--Now, Madam
Dingley, says she, 'tis fine weather, says she; yes, says she, and we have got
to our new lodgings.  I compute you ought to save eight pounds by being in the
others five months; and you have no more done it than eight thousand.  I am
glad you are rid of that squinting, blinking Frenchman.  I will give you a
bill on Parvisol for five pounds for the half-year.  And must I go on at four
shillings a week, and neither eat nor drink for it?  Who the Devil said
Atterbury and your Dean were alike?  I never saw your Chancellor, nor his
chaplain.  The latter has a good deal of learning, and is a well-wisher to be
an author:  your Chancellor is an excellent man.  As for Patrick's bird, he
bought him for his tameness, and is grown the wildest I ever saw.  His wings
have been quilled thrice, and are now up again:  he will be able to fly after
us to Ireland, if he be willing.--Yes, Mrs. Stella, Dingley writes more like
Presto than you; for all you superscribed the letter, as who should say, Why
should not I write like our Presto as well as Dingley?  You with your awkward
SS;[17] cannot you write them thus, SS?  No, but always SSS.  Spiteful sluts,
to affront Presto's writing; as that when you shut your eyes you write most
like Presto.  I know the time when I did not write to you half so plain as I
do now; but I take pity on you both.  I am very much concerned for Mrs.
Walls's eyes.  Walls says nothing of it to me in his letter dated after yours.
You say, "If she recovers, she may lose her sight."  I hope she is in no
danger of her life.  Yes, Ford is as sober as I please:  I use him to walk
with me as an easy companion, always ready for what I please, when I am weary
of business and Ministers.  I don't go to a Coffee-house twice a month.  I am
very regular in going to sleep before eleven.--And so you say that Stella is a
pretty girl; and so she be, and methinks I see her just now as handsome as the
day is long.  Do you know what? when I am writing in our language, I make up
my mouth just as if I was speaking it.  I caught myself at it just now.  And I
suppose Dingley is so fair and so fresh as a lass in May, and has her health,
and no spleen.--In your account you sent do you reckon as usual from the 1st
of November[18] was twelvemonth?  Poor Stella, will not Dingley leave her a
little daylight to write to Presto?  Well, well, we'll have daylight shortly,
spite of her teeth; and zoo[19] must cly Lele and Hele, and Hele aden.  Must
loo mimitate Pdfr, pay?  Iss, and so la shall.  And so lele's fol ee rettle.
Dood-mollow.--At night.  Mrs. Barton sent this morning to invite me to dinner;
and there I dined, just in that genteel manner that MD used when they would
treat some better sort of body than usual.

8.  O dear MD, my heart is almost broken.  You will hear the thing before this
comes to you.  I writ a full account of it this night to the Archbishop of
Dublin; and the Dean may tell you the particulars from the Archbishop.  I must
have an attested copy of all the writings; I send you 45 kreutzers.
How could you possibly accept such a proposal from our churlish landlord when
accompanied by a threat? Where was your good sense? Where it always is.

To-morrow early I shall send for the Variations, copy and originals. It
is not certain whether the Pr. comes or not; so be so good as to stay at home
till eight o'clock. You can come to dinner either to-day or to-morrow; but
you must settle which you mean to do, as it is not easy _for me_ to provide
provisions. Not later than half-past two o'clock. The housekeeper will tell
you about a lodging in the Landstrasse. It is high time, truly! As soon as you
hear of anything to be had on the Bastei or the Landstrasse, you must at
once give me notice. We must find out what room the landlord uses on account
of the well.--_Vale!_

SAMOTHRACIAN VAGABOND!--
You were dispatched yesterday to the South Pole, whereas we went off to the
North Pole, a slight difference now equalized by Captain Parry. There were,
however, no mashed potatoes there.

Bach [his lawyer], to whom I beg my best regards, is requested to say what
the lodging in Baden is to cost; we must also try to arrange that
Carl should come to me once every fortnight there (but cheaply; good heavens!

poverty and economy!).

I intrust this matter to you, as you have your friends and admirers among the
drivers and liverymen. If you get this in time, you had better go to
Bach to-day, so that I may receive his answer to-morrow forenoon. It is
almost too late now.

You might also take that rascal of a copyist by surprise; I don't expect much
good from him. He has now had the Variations for eight days.

Your ["friend" stroked out] _amicus_,

SAMOTHRACIAN!--
Don't trouble yourself to come here till you receive a _Hati Scherif_. I
must say you do not deserve the _golden_ cord. My fast-sailing frigate, the
worthy and well-born Frau Schnaps, will call every three or four days to
inquire after your health.

Farewell! Bring _no one whatever_ with you: farewell!

[Footnote 1: Schindler says in his _Biography_: "These _Variations_ [Op.

120] were completed in June, 1823, and delivered to the publisher, Diabelli,
without the usual amount of time bestowed on giving them the
finishing touches; and now he set to work at once at the ninth
Symphony, some jottings of which were already written down.

Forthwith all the gay humor that had made him more sociable, and in every respect
more accessible, at once disappeared.

All visits were declined," &c.]

345.

TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

Hetzendorf, July 15, 1823.

I trust that you are in the best possible health.

As for my eyes, they are improving, though slowly, and in six or seven
days at most I hope to have the good fortune to wait on Y.R.H. If I were not
obliged to use spectacles, I should get better sooner. It is a most distressing
occurrence, and has thrown me back in everything. What soothes my feelings,
however, is Y.R.H.
being fully aware that I am always to be of service to you. I have another
favor to ask of Y.R.H., which I hope you will graciously accede. Will Y.R.H.
be so kind as to grant me a testimonial to the following effect:
"That I wrote the Grand Mass expressly for Y.R.H.; that it has been
for some time in your possession; and that you have been pleased
to permit me to circulate it."

This ought to have been the case, and being no untruth, I hope I may claim
this favor. Such a testimonial will be of great service to me; for how could
I have believed that my slight talents would have exposed me to so much envy,
persecution, and calumny. It has always been my intention to ask Y.R.H.'s
permission to circulate the Mass, but the pressure of circumstances,
and above all my inexperience in worldly matters, as well as my
feeble health, has caused this confusion.

If the Mass is engraved hereafter, I hope to dedicate it to Y.R.H. when
published,[1] and not till then will the limited list of royal subscribers
appear. I shall ever consider Y.R.H. as my most illustrious patron, and make
this known to the world whenever it is in my power. In conclusion, I entreat
you again not to refuse my request about the testimonial. It will only cost
Y.R.H. a few lines, and ensure the best results for me.

I will bring the Variations[2] of Y.R.H. with me. They require little alteration,
and cannot fail to become a very pretty pleasing work for all lovers of music.
I must indeed appear a most importunate suitor. I beg you will kindly send
me the testimonial as soon as possible, for I require it.

[K.]

[Footnote 1: The Grand Mass (_Op._ 123) was published in 1827.]

346.

TO F. RIES.

Hetzendorf, July 16, 1823.

MY DEAR RIES,--
I received your letter with much pleasure the day before yesterday. The Variations
have, no doubt, arrived by this time. I could not write the dedication to
your wife, not knowing her name; so I beg you will write it yourself on the
part of your wife's friend and your own; let it be a surprise to her, for the
fair sex like that.--_Entre nous_, surprise is always the greatest charm of
the beautiful! As for the _Allegri di Bravura_, I must make allowance for
yours. To tell you the truth, I am no great friend to that kind of
thing, as it is apt to entail too much mere mechanism; at least, such is the
case with those I know. I have not yet looked at yours, but I shall ask ----
about them. I recommend you to be cautious in your intercourse with him. Could
I not be of use to you in many ways here? These printers, or rather _misprinters_,
as they ought to be called to deserve their names, pirate your works, and
give you nothing in return; this, surely, might be differently managed. I
mean to send you some choruses shortly, even if obliged to compose some new
ones, for this is my favorite style.

Thanks for the proceeds of the _bagatelles_, with which I am quite
satisfied.

Give nothing to the King of England. Pray accept anything you can get for the
Variations. I shall be perfectly contented. I only must stipulate to
take no other reward for the dedication to your wife than the kiss which I am
to receive in London.

You name _guineas_, whereas I only get _pounds sterling_, and I hear there is
a difference between these. Do not be angry with _un pauvre musicien
autrichien_, who is still at a very low ebb. I am now writing a new violin
quartet. Might not this be offered to the musical or unmusical London Jews?--_en
vrai Juif_.

I am, with cordial regard, Your old friend,
BEETHOVEN.

347.

TO HERR GEHEIMRATH VON KÖNNERITZ,--DRESDEN,[1] DIRECTOR OF THE ROYAL ORCHESTRA
AND THEATRE IN SAXONY.

     
     Hetzendorf, July 17, 1823.

SIR,--
I have too long deferred sending you a signed receipt and thanks, but I
feel sure you will pardon the delay from my great pressure of business,
owing to my health having improved, and God knows how long this may continue.
The description given by my dear friend Maria Weber[2] of your generous and
noble disposition encourages me to apply to you on another subject, namely,
about a Grand Mass which I am now issuing in manuscript.
Though I have met with a previous refusal on this matter [337],
still, as my esteemed Cardinal, H.R.

Highness the Archduke Rudolph, has written to H.R.H. Prince Anton, requesting
him to recommend the Mass to his Majesty the King of Saxony, I think this fresh
application might at all events be made, as I should consider it a great honor
to number among my distinguished subscribers (such as the King of Prussia,
the Emperor of Russia, the King of France, &c.) so great a connoisseur in music
as the King of Saxony.

I leave it to you, sir, to decide from this statement how and when you can best
effect my purpose. I am unable to send you to-day the application for a
subscription to my Mass to H.M. the King of Saxony, but I will do
so by the next post.

In any event I feel assured that you will not think I am one of those who
compose for the sake of paltry gain; but how often do events occur which
constrain a man to act contrary to his inclinations and his principles? My
Cardinal is a benevolent Prince, but means are wanting! I hope to receive
your forgiveness for my apparent importunity. If my poor abilities can in any
way be employed in your service, what extreme pleasure it would give me.

I am, sir, with esteem, Your expectant
BEETHOVEN.

[Footnote 1: The director-general of the Dresden theatre at that time was Von
Könneritz, who sent Beethoven forty ducats (requesting a receipt) for his
opera of _Fidelio_, performed with great applause April 29, 1823, and
conducted by C.M. von Weber. Madame Schröder-Devrient made her _début_ in
the character of Leonore.]
[Footnote 2: In Weber's _Biography_ it is stated (Vol. II. p. 465) that Beethoven
and Weber exchanged several letters about the performance of _Fidelio_, and in
fact Weber did receive letters from Beethoven on February 16, April 10, and
June 9. Unhappily, no part of this correspondence has yet been discovered,
except a fragment of the sketch of a letter written by Weber of January 28,
1823, which sufficiently proves that Beethoven was right in calling him
his _friend_. It is as follows:--"This mighty work, teeming with German
grandeur and depth of feeling, having been given under my direction at Prague,
had enabled me to acquire the most enthusiastic and instructive knowledge
of its inner essence, by means of which I hope to produce it before
the public here with full effect, provided as I am with all possible
accessories for the purpose.

Each performance will be a festival to me, permitting me to pay that homage to
your mighty spirit which dwells in the inmost recesses of my heart, where love
and admiration strive for the mastery." On October 5 of this year, Weber
visited Beethoven in Baden, with Haslinger and Benedict.]

348.

TO HERR V. KÖNNERITZ,--DRESDEN.

Vienna, July 25, 1823.

SIR,--
Forgive my importunity in sending to your care the enclosed letter from me
to his R.H. Prince Anton of Saxony; it contains an application to his Majesty
the King of Saxony to subscribe to a mass of mine. I recently mentioned
to you that the Cardinal Archduke Rudolph had written to his M.

the King of Saxony about this Mass; I entreat you to use all your influence in
this matter, and I leave it entirely to your own judgment and knowledge of
local matters to act as you think best.

Although I do not doubt that the recommendation of my Cardinal will have
considerable weight, still the decision of his Majesty cannot fail
to be much influenced by the advice of the Administrator of objects connected
with the fine arts. Hitherto, in spite of apparent brilliant success, I have
scarcely realized as much as a publisher would have given me for the work, the
expenses of copying being so very great. It was the idea of my friends to
circulate this Mass, for, thank God! I am a mere novice in all speculations.
In the mean time, there is not a single _employé_ of our Government who has
not been, like myself, a loser.

Had it not been for my continued bad health for many years past, a foreign
country would at least have enabled me to live free from all cares except
those for art. Judge me kindly, and not harshly; I live only for my art, and
my sole wish is to fulfil my duties as a man; but this, alas!
cannot always be accomplished without the influence of the _subterranean powers_.
While commending my cause to you, I also venture to hope that your love of
art, and above all your philanthropy, will induce you to be so good as
to write me a few lines, informing me of the result as soon as you are acquainted
with it.

I am, sir, with high consideration,
Your obedient
BEETHOVEN.

349.

TO SCHINDLER.

August, 1823.

YOU SAMOTHRACIAN VILLAIN!

--
Make haste and come, for the weather is just right. Better early than late--_presto,
prestissimo_! We are to drive from here.[1]
[Footnote 1: Beethoven had apartments in a summer residence of Baron Pronay's
on his beautiful property at Hetzendorf. Suddenly, however, the _maestro_,
deeply immersed in the _Ninth Symphony_, was no longer satisfied with this
abode, because "the Baron would persist in making him profound bows every
time that he met him." So, with the help of Schindler and Frau Schnaps,
he removed to Baden in August, 1823.]

350.

TO HIS NEPHEW.

Baden, August 16, 1823.

MY DEAR BOY,--
I did not wish to say anything to you till I found my health improving
here, which, however, is scarcely even yet the case.

I came here with a cold and catarrh, which were very trying to me, my constitution
being naturally rheumatic, which will, I fear, soon cut the thread of my life,
or, still worse, gradually wear it away. The miserable state of my digestive
organs, too, can only be restored by medicines and diet, and for this I
have to thank my _faithful_ servants! You will learn how constantly I am in
the open air when I tell you that to-day for the first time I properly (or
improperly, though it was involuntary) resumed my suit to my Muse. I _must_
work, but do not wish it to be known. Nothing can be more tempting (to me at
least) than the enjoyment of beautiful Nature at these baths, but _nous sommes
trop pauvres, et il faut écrire ou de n'avoir pas de quoi_. Get on, and make
every preparation for your examination, and be unassuming, so that you may
prove yourself higher and better than people expect. Send your linen
here at once; your gray trousers must still be wearable, at all events at home;
for, my dear son, you are indeed very _dear_ to me! My address is, "At the
coppersmith's," &c. Write instantly to say that you have got this letter. I
will send a few lines to that contemptible creature, Schindler, though I am
most unwilling to have anything to do with such a wretch. If we could write
as quickly as we think and feel, I could say a great deal not a little remarkable;
but for to-day I can only add that I wish a certain Carl may prove
worthy of all my love and unwearied care, and learn fully to
appreciate it.

Though not certainly exacting, as you know, still there are many ways in which
we can show those who are better and nobler than ourselves that we acknowledge
their superiority.

I embrace you from my heart.

Your faithful and true
FATHER.

351.

TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

August, 1823.
I am really very ill, and not suffering from my eyes alone. I intend
to drag myself to-morrow to Baden, to look out for a lodging, and
to go there altogether in the course of a few days. The air in town
has a very bad effect on my whole organization, and has really
injured my health, having gone twice to town to consult my physicians.
It will be easier for me to repair to Y.R.H. in Baden. I am quite
inconsolable, both on account of Y.R.H. and myself, that my usefulness
is thus limited. I have marked some things in the Variations, but
I can explain these better verbally.

[K.] 

352.
TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

Baden, August 22, 1823.
Your gracious letter led me to believe that Y.R.H. intended to
return to Baden, where I arrived on the 13th, very ill; but I am
now better. I had recently another inflammatory cold, having just
recovered from one. My digestion, too, was miserable, and my eyes
very bad; in short, my whole system seemed impaired. I was obliged
to make the effort to come here, without even being able to see
Y.R.H. Thank God, my eyes are so much better that I can again venture
to make tolerable use of them by daylight. My other maladies, too,
are improving, and I cannot expect more in so short a period. How
I wish that Y.R.H. were only here, when in a few days we could
entirely make up for lost time. Perhaps I may still be so fortunate
as to see Y.R.H. here, and be able to show my zeal to serve Y.R.H.
How deeply does this cause me to lament my unhappy state of health.
Much as I wish for its entire restoration, still I greatly fear
that this will never be the case, and on this account I hope for
Y.R.H.'s indulgence. As I can now at length prove how gladly I place
myself at Y.R.H.'s disposal, my most anxious desire is that you
would be pleased to make use of me.

[K.] 

353.
TO THE ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH.

1823.
I have just been enjoying a short walk and composing a Canon,
"Grossen Dank, ÷ ÷ ÷," when, on returning home, with the intention
of writing it out for Y.R.H., I find a petitioner who is under the
delusion that his request will be better received if made through
me. What can I do? A good action cannot be too soon performed, and
even a whim must be sometimes humored.
The bearer of this is Kapellmeister Drechsler, of the Josephstadt
and Baden Theatre; he wishes to obtain the situation of second Court
organist. He has a good knowledge of thorough bass, and is also a
good organist, besides being favorably known as a composer,--all
qualities that recommend him for this situation. He _rightly_ thinks
that the best recommendation to secure him the appointment is that
of Y.R.H., who, being yourself so great a connoisseur and performer,
know better than any one how to appreciate true merit; and assuredly
H.I. Majesty would prefer such testimony to every other. I therefore
add my entreaties, though with some hesitation, to those of Herr
D., relying on the indulgence and kindness of Y.R.H., and in the
hope that the illustrious patron and protector of all that is good
will do what lies in his power to be of use on this occasion.
My Canon shall be sent to-morrow,[1] together with the confession
of my sins, intentional and unintentional, for which I beg your
gracious absolution. My eyes, alas! prevent me from saying to-day
as I could wish my hopes and desires that all good may attend
you.
P.S. I ought also to mention that Herr Drechsler is the unsalaried
professor of thorough bass at St. Anna's, and has been so for the
last ten years.

[K.]
[Footnote 1: The Canon, _Grossen Dank, ÷ ÷ ÷_, is not to be found
in either Breitkopf & Härtel's or Thayer's catalogue, nor anywhere
else.] 

354.

TO F. RIES.

Baden, September 5, 1823.
MY DEAR FRIEND,--
You advise me to engage some one to look after my affairs; now I
did so as to the Variations; that is, my brother and Schindler took
charge of them, but how?
The Variations were not to have appeared here till after being
published in London; but everything went wrong. The dedication to
Brentano [Antonie v.
Brentano, _née_ Edlen von Birkenstock] was to be confined to Germany,
I being under great obligations to her, and having nothing else to
spare at the moment; indeed, Diabelli, the publisher, alone got it
from me. But everything went through Schindler's hands. No man on
earth was ever more contemptible,--an arch villain; but I soon sent
him packing! I will dedicate some other work to your wife in the
place of this one. You, no doubt, received my last letter [No. 346].
I think thirty ducats would be enough for one of the _Allegri di
Bravura_, but I should like to publish them here at the same time,
which might easily be arranged. Why should I give up so much profit
to these rogues here? It will not be published here till I am told
that it has arrived in London; moreover, you may yourself fix the
price, as you best know London customs.
The copyist to-day at last finished the score of the Symphony; so
Kirchhoffer and I are only waiting for a favorable opportunity to
send it off. I am still here, being very ill when I arrived, and
my health still continues in a most precarious condition, and, good
heavens! instead of amusing myself like others at these baths, my
necessities compel me to write every day. I am also obliged to drink
the mineral waters besides bathing. The copy will shortly be sent
off; I am only waiting till I hear of an opportunity from Kirchhoffer,
for it is too bulky to forward by post.
My last letter must have given you an insight into everything. I
will send you some choruses; let me have any commissions for oratorios
as soon as you can, that I may fix the time at once. I am sorry
about the Variations on account of ----, as I wrote them more for
London than here. This is not my fault. Answer me very soon, both
as to particulars and time. Kind regards to your family.

355.
TO F. RIES,--LONDON.

Baden, September 5, 1823.
MY DEAR KIND RIES,--
I have still no tidings of the Symphony, but you may depend on its
soon being in London. Were I not so poor as to be obliged to live
by my pen, I would accept nothing from the Philharmonic Society;
but as it is, I must wait till the money for the Symphony is made
payable here; though as a proof of my interest and confidence in
that Society, I have already sent off the new Overture, and I leave
it to them to settle the payment as they please.I would be glad to know whether you like it, because I would
send you more by people that are now every day thinking of going to Ireland;
therefore pray tell me, and tell me soon: and I will have the strong box.

27.  A rainy, wretched, scurvy day from morning till night:  and my neighbour
Vanhomrigh invited me to dine with them and this evening I passed at Mr.

may be a letter from MD at the Coffee-house?  Well, you must know, and so, I
just now sent Patrick, and he brought me three letters, but not one from MD,
no indeed, for I read all the superscriptions; and not one from MD.  , when;
