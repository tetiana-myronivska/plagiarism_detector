                     But both "spinster" and "old maid" have narrow,
restricted attributes, which, to say the least, imply doubt as to past
opportunity.

Names are covertly responsible for many overt acts. Carlyle, when he said,
"The name is the earliest garment you wrap around the earth-visiting me.
Names? Not only all common speech, but Science, Poetry itself, if thou
consider it, is no other than a right naming," sounded a wonderful note in
Moral Philosophy, which rings false many a time in real life, when to ring
true would change the whole face of affairs.

Thus I boldly affirm, that were there a proper sounding title to cover the
class of unmarried women, many a marriage which now takes place, with
either moderate success or distinct failure, would remain in pleasing
embryo.

So they [agreed upon this and] abode awaiting Mesrour, till such time
as he should return with news.

As for Mesrour, he gave not over running till he came to the by-street,
[wherein was the house] of Aboulhusn el Khelia. Now the latter was sitting
reclining at the lattice, and chancing to look round, saw Mesrour running
along the street and said to Nuzhet el Fuad, "Meseemeth the Khalif, when
I went forth from him, dismissed the Divan and went in to the Lady Zubeideh,
to condole with her [for thee;] whereupon she arose and condoled
with him [for me,] saying, 'God greaten thy recompence for [the
loss of] Aboulhusn el Khelia!'

And he said to her, 'None is dead save Nuzhet el Fuad, may thy head outlive
her!' Quoth she, 'It is not she who is dead, but Aboulhusn el Khelia, thy
boon-companion.' And he to her, 'None is dead but Nuzhet el Fuad.'

And they gainsaid one another, till the Khalif waxed wroth and they laid
a wager, and he hath sent Mesrour the sword- bearer to see who is
dead. Wherefore it were best that thou lie down, so he may see thee and
go and acquaint the Khalif and confirm my saying." So Nuzhet el Fuad
stretched herself out and Aboulhusn covered her with her veil and sat
at her head, weeping.

    Presently, in came Mesrour the eunuch
       to him and saluted him and seeing Nuzhet
     el Fuad stretched out, uncovered her face
       and said, "There is no god but God!

Our sister Nuzhet el Fuad is dead. How sudden was the [stroke of] destiny!
May God have mercy on thee and acquit thee of responsibility!" Then
he returned and related what had passed before the Khalif and the Lady
Zubeideh, and he laughing. "O accursed one,' said the Khalif, "is
this a time for laughter?

Tell us which is dead of them." "By Allah, O my lord," answered Mesrour,
"Aboulhusn is well and none is dead but Nuzhet el Fuad." Quoth the Khalif
to Zubeideh, "Thou hast lost thy pavilion in thy play," and he laughed at
her and said to Mesrour, "O Mesrour, tell her what thou sawest."

"Verily, O my lady," said the eunuch, "I ran without ceasing till
I came in to Aboulhusn in his house and found Nuzhet el Fuad lying
dead and Aboulhusn sitting at her head, weeping.

  I saluted him and condoled with him and sat down by his side and
uncovered the face of Nuzhet el Fuad and saw her dead and her face
swollen.

  So I said to him, 'Carry her out forthright [to burial], so we may
pray over her.'

   He answered, 'It is well;' and I left him to lay her out and came
hither, that I might tell you the news."

   The Khalif laughed and said, "Tell it again and again to thy lady
lack-wit."

   When the Lady Zubeideh heard Mesrour's words [and those of the
Khalif,] she was wroth and said, "None lacketh wit but he who
believeth a black slave."

   And she reviled Mesrour, whilst the Khalif laughed.

   Mesrour was vexed at this and said to the Khalif, "He spoke sooth
who said, 'Women lack wit and religion.'"

   Then said the Lady Zubeideh to the Khalif, "O Commander of the
Faithful, thou sportest and jestest with me, and this slave hoodwinketh
me, to please thee; but I will send and see which is dead of them."

   And he answered, saying, "Send one who shall see which is dead of
them."

   So the Lady Zubeideh cried out to an old woman, a stewardess, and
said to her, "Go to the house of Nuzhet el Fuad in haste and see
who is dead and loiter not."

   And she railed at her.

  

  The old woman went out, running, whilst the Khalif and Mesrour
laughed, and gave not over running till she came into the street.

  Aboulhusn saw her and knowing her, said to his wife, "O Nuzhet el
Fuad, meseemeth the Lady Zubeideh hath sent to us to see who is
dead and hath not given credence to Mesrour's report of thy death;
so she hath despatched the old woman, her stewardess, to discover
the truth; wherefore it behoveth me to be dead in my turn, for the
sake of thy credit with the Lady Zubeideh."

                    Accordingly, he lay down and stretched himself out, and she covered
him and bound his eyes and feet and sat at his head, weeping.

                           Presently, the old woman came in to her and saw her sitting at
Aboulhusn's head, weeping and lamenting; and when she saw the old
woman, she cried out and said to her, "See what hath betided me!

                                   Indeed, Aboulhusn is dead and hath left me alone and forlorn!"

                        Then she cried out and tore her clothes and said to the old woman,
"O my mother, how good he was!"

                Quoth the other, "Indeed thou art
                 excused, for thou wast used to him and
                 he to thee."

Then she considered what Mesrour had reported to the Khalif and the Lady
Zubeideh and said to her, "Indeed, Mesrour goeth about to sow discord
between the Khalif and the Lady Zubeideh." "And what is the [cause of]
discord, O my mother?" asked Nuzhet el Fuad. "O my daughter," answered
the old woman, "Mesrour came to the Khalif and the Lady Zubeideh and
gave them news of thee that thou wast dead and that Aboulhusn was well.
"And Nuzhet el Fuad said to her, "O my aunt, I was with my lady
but now and she gave me a hundred dinars and a piece of silk; and now
see my condition and that which hath befallen me! Indeed, I am bewildered,
and how shall I do, and I alone, forlorn? Would God I had died and he had
lived!"

Then she wept and the old woman with her and the latter went up to Aboulhusn
and uncovering his face, saw his eyes bound and swollen for the binding.
So she covered him again and said, "Indeed, O Nuzhet el Fuad, thou art
afflicted in Aboulhusn!" Then she condoled with her and going out from
her, ran without ceasing till she came in to the Lady Zubeideh and
related to her the story; and the princess said to her, laughing,
"Tell it over again to the Khalif, who maketh me out scant of wit
and lacking of religion, and to this ill-omened slave, who presumeth
to contradict me."

Quoth Mesrour, "This old woman lieth; for I saw Aboulhusn well and Nuzhet
el Fuad it was who lay dead." "It is thou that liest," rejoined the
stewardess, "and wouldst fain sow discord between the Khalif and
the Lady Zubeideh."

And he said, "None lieth but thou, O old woman of ill-omen, and thy
lady believeth thee, and she doteth." Whereupon the Lady Zubeideh cried
out at him, and indeed she was enraged at him and at his speech and
wept.

Then said the Khalif to her, "I lie and my eunuch lieth, and thou liest
and thy waiting-woman lieth; so methinks we were best go, all four of
us together, that we may see which of us telleth the truth." Quoth Mesrour,
"Come, let us go, that I may put this ill-omened old woman to shame[FN#37]
and deal her a sound drubbing for her lying." And she answered
him, saying, "O dotard, is thy wit like unto my wit? Indeed, thy wit
is as the hen's wit." Mesrour was incensed at her words and would have
laid violent hands on her, but the Lady Zubeideh warded him off from
her and said to him, "Her sooth-fastness will presently be distinguished
from thy sooth-fastness and her leasing from thy leasing."
Then they all four arose, laying wagers with one another, and went
forth, walking, from the palace-gate [and fared on] till they came
in at the gate of the street in which Aboulhusn el Khelia dwelt.

He saw them and said to his wife Nuzhet el Fuad, "Verily, all that is
sticky is not a pancake and not every time cometh the jar off safe.[FN#38]'
Meseemeth the old woman hath gone and told her lady and acquainted her
with our case and she hath disputed with Mesrour the eunuch and they
have laid wagers with one another about our death and are come to
us, all four, the Khalif and the eunuch and the Lady Zubeideh and
the old woman."

When Nuzhet el Fuad heard this, she started up from her lying posture
and said, "How shall we do?" And he said, "We will both feign ourselves
dead and stretch ourselves out and hold our breath."

So she hearkened unto him and they both lay down on the siesta[-carpet]
and bound their feet and shut their eyes and covered themselves with the
veil and held their breath.

Presently, up came the Khalif and the Lady Zubeideh and Mesrour and the old
woman and entering, found Aboulhusn and his wife both stretched out
[apparently] dead; which when the Lady Zubeideh saw, she wept and
said, "They ceased not to bring [ill] news of my slave- girl, till she
died; methinketh Aboulhusn's death was grievous to her and that she died
after him."

[FN#39]. Quoth the Khalif, "Thou shalt not forestall me with talk and prate.
She certainly died before Aboulhusn, for he came to me with his
clothes torn and his beard plucked out, beating his breast with two
bricks, and I gave him a hundred dinars and a piece of silk and said
to him, 'Go, carry her forth [and bury her] and I will give thee
a concubine other than she and handsomer, and she shall be in stead
of her.'

But it would appear that her death was no light matter to him and he
died after her;[FN#40] so it is I who have beaten thee and gotten thy
stake."
The Lady Zubeideh answered him many words and the talk waxed amain
between them. At last the Khalif sat down at the heads of the pair
and said, "By the tomb of the Apostle of God (may He bless and preserve
him!) and the sepulchres of my fathers and forefathers, whoso will tell
me which of them died before the other, I will willingly give him a thousand
dinars!" When Aboulhusn heard the Khalifs words, he sprang up in haste and
said, "I died first, O Commander of the Faithful! Hand over the thousand
dinars and quit thine oath and the conjuration by which thou
sworest."

Then Nuzhet el Fuad rose also and stood up before the Khalif and the Lady
Zubeideh, who both rejoiced in this and in their safety, and the
princess chid her slave-girl. Then the Khalif and the Lady Zubeideh
gave them joy at their well-being and knew that this [pretended] death
was a device to get the money; and the princess said to Nuzhet el Fuad,
"Thou shouldst have sought of me that which thou desiredst, without this
fashion, and not have consumed my heart for thee." And she said, "Indeed,
I was ashamed, O my lady."

As for the Khalif, he swooned away for laughing and said, "O Aboulhusn, thou
wilt never cease to be a wag and do rarities and oddities!" Quoth he, "O
Commander of the Faithful, I played off this trick, for that the money
was exhausted, which thou gavest me, and I was ashamed to ask of thee again.
When I was single, I could never keep money; but since thou marriedst me
to this damsel here, if I possessed thy wealth, I should make an end of it.
So, when all that was in my hand was spent, I wrought this trick, so I might
get of thee the hundred dinars and the piece of silk; and all this is
an alms from our lord. But now make haste to give me the thousand dinars
and quit thee of thine oath."
The Khalif and the Lady Zubeideh laughed and returned to the palace;
and he gave Aboulhusn the thousand dinars, saying, "Take them as a
thank-offering for thy preservation from death," whilst the princess
did the like with Nuzhet el Fuad.

Moreover, the Khalif increased Aboulhusn in his stipends and allowances,
and he [and his wife] ceased not [to live] in joy and contentment, till
there came to them the Destroyer of Delights and Sunderer of Companies,
he who layeth waste the palaces and peopleth the tombs.

                                   THE KHALIF OMAR BEN ABDULAZIZ AND THE POETS.

                         [FN#41]

     
     It is said that, when the Khalifate devolved on Omar ben Abdulaziz[FN#42]
     (of whom God accept), the poets [of the time] resorted to
     him, as they had been used to resort to the Khalifs before him,
and abode at his door days and days, but he gave them not leave to
enter, till there came to Omar Adi ben Artah,[FN#43] who stood high
in esteem with him.

Jerir[FN#44] accosted him and begged him to crave admission for them [to
the Khalif]. "It is well," answered Adi and going in to Omar, said to
him, "The poets are at thy door and have been there days and days; yet hast
thou not given them leave to enter, albeit their sayings are abiding[FN#45]
and their arrows go straight to the mark." Quoth Omar, "What have I to do
with the poets?" And Adi answered, saying, "O Commander of the Faithful,
the Prophet (whom God bless and preserve) was praised [by a poet] and
gave [him largesse,] and therein[FN#46] is an exemplar to every Muslim."
Quoth Omar, "And who praised him?" "Abbas ben Mirdas[FN#47] praised
him," replied Adi, "and he clad him with a suit and said, 'O Bilal,[FN#48]
cut off from me his tongue!'" "Dost thou remember what he said?"

asked the Khalif; and Adi said, "Yes." "Then repeat it," rejoined Omar.
So Adi recited the following verses:

I saw thee, O thou best of all the human race, display A book that came
to teach the Truth to those in error's way.
Thou madest known to us therein the road of righteousness, When we
had wandered from the Truth, what while in gloom it lay.

A dark affair thou littest up with Islam and with proof Quenchedst the
flaming red-coals of error and dismay.
Mohammed, then, I do confess, God's chosen prophet is, And every man
requited is for that which he doth say.
The road of right thou hast made straight, that erst was crooked grown;
Yea, for its path of old had fall'n to ruin and decay.
Exalted mayst thou be above th' empyrean heaven of joy And may God's
glory greater grow and more exalted aye!

"And indeed," continued Adi, "this ode on the Prophet (may God bless and
keep him!) is well known and to comment it would be tedious." Quoth
Omar, "Who is at the door?" "Among them is Omar ibn [Abi] Rebya the
Cureishite,"[FN#49] answered Adi, and the Khalif said, "May God
show him no favour neither quicken him!

Was it not he who said ... ?" And he recited the following verses:

Would God upon that bitterest day, when my death calls for me, What's
'twixt thine excrement and blood[FN#50] I still may smell of thee!
Yea, so but Selma in the dust my bedfellow may prove, Fair fall it thee!
In heaven or hell I reck not if it be.

"Except," continued the Khalif, "he were the enemy of God, he had wished
for her in this world, so he might after [repent and] return to righteous
dealing. By Allah, he shall not come in to me! Who is at the door other
than he?" Quoth Adi, "Jemil ben Mamer el Udhri[FN#51] is at the door;"
and Omar said, "It is he who says in one of his odes" ... [And he recited
the following:]
Would we may live together and when we come to die, God grant the
death-sleep bring me within her tomb to lie!

For if "Her grave above her is levelled" it be said, Of life and its
continuance no jot indeed reck I.

"Away with him from me! Who is at the door?" "Kutheiyir Azzeh,"[FN#52]
replied Adi, and Omar said, "It is he who says in one of his odes ...
" [And he repeated the following verses:]
Some with religion themselves concern and make it their business all;
Sitting,[FN#53] they weep for the pains of hell and still for mercy
bawl!
If they could hearken to Azzeh's speech, as I, I hearken to it, They
straight would humble themselves to her and prone before her fall.

"Leave the mention of him. Who is at the door?" Quoth Adi, "El Akhwes el
Ansari."[FN#54] "God the Most High put him away and estrange him from His
mercy!" cried Omar. "Is it not he who said, berhyming on a man of Medina
his slave-girl, so she might outlive her master ... ?" [And he repeated the
following line:]
God [judge] betwixt me and her lord! Away With her he flees me and I follow
aye.

"He shall not come in to me. Who is at the door, other than he?" "Heman
ben Ghalib el Ferezdec,"[FN#55] answered Adi; and Omar said, "It is he who
saith, glorying in adultery ..."

[And he repeated the following verses:]
The two girls let me down from fourscore fathoms' height, As swoops a
hawk, with wings all open in full flight; And when my feet trod earth,
"Art slain, that we should fear," Quoth they, "or live, that we
may hope again thy sight?"

"He shall not come in to me. Who is at the door, other than he?" "El
Akhtel et Teghlibi,"[FN#56] answered Adi; and Omar said, "He is the
unbeliever who says in his verse ..." [And he repeated the following:]

Ramazan in my life ne'er I fasted, nor e'er Have I eaten of flesh, save
in public[FN#57] it were.

No exhorter am I to abstain from the fair, Nor to love Mecca's vale for
my profit I care; Nor, like others a little ere morning appear who bawl,
"Come to safety!"[FN#58] I stand up to prayer.
Nay, at daybreak I drink of the wind-freshened wine And prostrate
me[FN#59] instead in the dawn-whitened air.

"By Allah, he treadeth no carpet of mine! Who is at the door other than
he?" "Jerir ibn el Khetefa," answered Adi; and Omar said, "It is
he who saith ... " [And he recited as follows:]
But for the spying of the eyes [ill-omened,] we had seen Wild
cattle's eyes and antelopes' tresses of sable sheen.
The huntress of th' eyes[FN#60] by night came to me.

"Turn in peace," [Quoth I to her;] "This is no time for visiting, I ween."

"If it must be and no help, admit Jerir." So Adi went forth and admitted
Jerir, who entered, saying:

He, who Mohammed sent, as prophet to mankind, Hath to a just
high-priest[FN#61] the Khalifate assigned.
His justice and his truth all creatures do embrace; The erring he corrects
and those of wandering mind.
I hope for present[FN#62] good [and bounty at thy hand,] For souls
of men are still to present[FN#63] good inclined.

Quoth Omar, "O Jerir, keep the fear of God before thine eyes and
say nought but the truth."

And Jerir recited the following verses:

How many, in Yemameh,[FN#64] dishevelled widows plain! How many a weakling
orphan unsuccoured doth remain, For whom is thy departure even as a
father's loss! To fly or creep, like nestlings, alone, they strive in
vain.
Now that the clouds have broken their promise to our hope, We trust the
Khalif's bounty will stand to us for rain.[FN#65]
When the Khalif heard this, he said, "By Allah, O Jerir, Omar
possesseth but a hundred dirhems."

[FN#66] [And he cried out to his servant, saying,] "Ho, boy! give them to
him." Moreover, he gave him the ornaments of his sword; and Jerir went forth
to the [other] poets, who said to him, "What is behind thee?"[FN#67] And
he answered, "A man who giveth to the poor and denieth the poets, and I
am well-pleased with him."

[FN#68]

EL HEJJAJ AND THE THREE YOUNG MEN.[FN#69]

They tell that El Hejjaj[FN#70] once commanded the Master of Police
[of Bassora] to go round about [the city] by night, and whomsoever he
found [abroad] after nightfall, that he should strike off his head.

So he went round one night of the nights and came upon three youths
staggering from side to side, and on them signs of [intoxication
with] wine. So the officers laid hold of them and the captain of the
watch said to them, "Who are ye that ye transgress the commandment of the
[lieutenant of the] Commander of the Faithful and come abroad at this
hour?" Quoth one of the youths, "I am the son of him to whom [all]
necks[FN#71] abase themselves, alike the nose-pierced[FN#72] of them and
the [bone-]breaker;[FN#73] they come to him in their own despite,
abject and submissive, and he taketh of their wealth[FN#74] and of
their blood."

The master of police held his hand from him, saying, "Belike he is of
the kinsmen of the Commander of the Faithful," and said to the second,
"Who art thou?" Quoth he, "I am the son of him whose rank[FN#75] time
abaseth not, and if it descend[FN#76] one day, it will assuredly
return [to its former height]; thou seest the folk [crowd] in troops
to the light of his fire, some standing around it and some sitting."

So the master of the police refrained from slaying him and said to the
third, "Who art thou?" Quoth he, "I am the son of him who plungeth through
the ranks[FN#77] with his might and correcteth[FN#78] them with
the sword,[FN#79] so that they stand straight;[FN#80] his feet are
not loosed from the stirrup,[FN#81] whenas the horsemen on the day
of battle are weary."

                                   So the master of police held his hand from him also, saying, "Belike,
he is the son of a champion of the Arabs."

                          Then he kept them under guard, and when the morning morrowed, he
referred their case to El Hejjaj, who caused bring them before him
and enquiring into their affair, found that the first was the son
of a barber-surgeon, the second of a [hot] bean-seller and the third
of a weaver.

                               So he marvelled at their
                  readiness of speech[FN#82] and said
                  to his session-mates, "Teach your sons deportment;[FN#83] for, by
Allah, but for their ready wit, I had smitten off their heads!"

HAROUN ER RESHID AND THE WOMAN OF THE BARMECIDES.[FN#84]

They tell that Haroun er Reshid was sitting one day to do away grievances,
when there came up to him a woman and said to him, "O Commander of the
Faithful, may God accomplish thine affair and cause thee rejoice in that
which He hath given thee and increase thee in elevation! Indeed, thou
hast done justice[FN#85] and wrought equitably."[FN#86] Quoth the Khalif
to those who were present with him, "Know ye what this woman meaneth
by her saying?"

But Flossy's mother named her--not Florence, but Flossy. I suppose she was
one of those fluffy, curly, silky babies. She grew to be that kind of a
girl--a Flossy girl. It speaks for itself. I suppose with that name she
never had any incentive to outgrow her nature.

It came out on her wedding cards:

    "Mr. and Mrs. CHARLES FAY CARLETON
     request you to be present at the
        marriage of their daughter
                 FLOSSY
                   to
       Mr. BRONSON STURGIS HERRICK."

The contrast between the two names, hers so nonsensical and his so
dignified and strong, was no greater than that between the two people.
In truth, their names were symbolic of their natures. It looked really
pitiful to me.

I wondered if anybody besides Rachel English and me looked into their
future with apprehension. Our misgivings, I must admit, were all for
Bronson.

Ah, well-a-day! It is so easy to feel sympathy for a man you admire,
especially if he is strong and loyal, and does not ask or desire it of
you.

Flossy was one of those cuddling girls. She appealed to you with her eyes,
and you found yourself petting her and sympathizing with her, when, if you
stopped to think, you would see that she had more of everything than you
had. She possessed a rich father, a beautiful house, and perfect health.
Nevertheless, you found yourself asking after "poor Flossy," and your
voice commiserated her if your words did not. She invariably had some
trifling ill to tell you of. She had hurt her arm, or scratched her hand,
or the snow made her eyes ache, or she was tired. She never seemed at
liberty to enjoy herself, although she went everywhere, and seemed to do
so successfully in spite of her imaginary ills, if you let her enjoy
herself by telling you of them.

Everybody helped Flossy to live. Everybody protected and looked after her.
There was some one on his knees continually, removing invisible brambles
from her rose-leaf path. She didn't know how to do anything for herself.
She never buttoned her own boots. When her maid was not with her, other
people put her jacket on for her, and carried her umbrella and buttoned
her gloves. Men always buttoned her gloves, and her gloves always had more
buttons, and more unruly buttons, than any other gloves I ever saw. But
then I am elderly.

I never knew Flossy to do anything for anybody. She never gave things
away, but on Christmas and her birthdays she received remembrances from
everybody. I used to make her presents without knowing why or even
thinking of it. Flossy's name was on all the Christmas lists, and she used
to shed tears over the kindness of her friends, and write the prettiest
notes to them, so plaintive and self-deprecatory. Then they took her to
drive, or did something more for her. Flossy read poetry and cried over
it. She wrote poetry too, and other people cried over that.

When Bronson Herrick told me he was going to marry her, I wanted to say,
"No, you are not." But I didn't. I did not even seem to be surprised, for
he is so proud he would have resented any surprise on my part. He told me
about it of course, knowing that I could not fail to be pleased. (His
photograph is in that japanned box of mine. This smile on my face, Tabby,
is rather sardonic. Why is it that men expect an old sweetheart to take an
active interest in their bride-elect, and are so deadly sure that they
will like each other?)

"She is the most sympathetic little thing," he said enthusiastically. "She
reminds me of you in so many ways. You are very much alike."

"Oh, thank you, Bronson Sturgis Herrick! I assure you I would cheerfully
drown myself if I thought you were right about that," I exclaimed
mentally.

He repeated over and over that she was "so sympathetic." He meant, of
course, that she had wept over him. Flossy's tears flow like rain if you
crook your finger at her, and tears wring the heart of a man like Bronson.
To think he was going to marry her! I just looked at him, I remember, as
he stood so straight and tall before me, and said to myself, "Well, you
dear, honest, loyal, clever man! You are just the kind of a man that women
fool most unmercifully. But it's nature, and you can't help it. Go and
marry this Flossy girl, and commit mental suicide if you must."

"Sympathetic!"

So he married her five years ago, and became her man-servant.

When they had been married about a year, people said that Bronson was
working himself to death. I, being an Old Maid, and liking to meddle with
other people's business, told him that I thought he ought to take a
vacation. He said he couldn't afford it. I was honestly surprised at that,
because, while he was not rich, he was extremely well-to-do, with a
rapidly increasing law practice. And then Flossy's father had been very
generous when she married him. He was considerate enough to reply to my
look.

"You know I married a rich girl. Flossy's money is her own. She has saved
it--I wished her to save it, I _wished_ it--and I am doing my level best
to support her as nearly as possible in the way in which she has been
accustomed to live. She ought to have an easier time, poor child."

So he did not take a vacation, and the summer was very hot, and when
Flossy came home from Rye she found him wretchedly ill, and discovered
that he had had a trained nurse for two weeks before he let her know
anything about it. Then people pitied Flossy for having her summer
interrupted, and Flossy felt that it was a shame; but she very willingly
sat and fanned Bronson for as much as an hour every day and answered
questions languidly and was pale, and people sent her flowers and were
extremely sorry for her.

When Bronson became well enough to go away, as his doctors ordered, for a
complete rest, Rachel English happened to go on the same train with them,
and the next day I received a letter, or rather an envelope, from her,
with this single sentence enclosed: "And if she didn't make him hold her
in his arms in broad daylight every step of the way, because the train
jarred her back!"

(Tabby, there is no use in talking. I must stop and pull your ears. Come
here and let Missis be really rough with you for a minute.)

There are some women who prefer a valet to a husband; who think that the
more menial are his services in public, the more apparent is his devotion.
It is a Roman-chariot-wheel idea, which degrades both the man and the
woman in the eyes of the spectators. I wrote to Rachel, and said in the
letter, "One horse in the span always does most of the pulling, you know,
especially uphill." And Rachel wrote back, "Wouldn't I just like to drive
this pair, though!"

Bronson had his ideals before he was married, as most men have, concerning
the kind of a home he hoped for. He always said that it was not so much
what your home was, as how it was. He believed that a home consisted more
in the feelings and aims of its inmates than in rugs and jardinières. He
said to me once, "The oneness of two people could make a home in Sahara."

He was ambitious, too, feeling within himself that power which makes
orators and statesmen, but needing the approval and encouragement of some
one who also realized his capabilities, to enable him to do his best. He
himself was the one who was sympathetic, if he had only known it. His
nature responded with the utmost readiness to whatever appealed to him
from the side of right or justice.

He had noble hopes in many directions, hopes which inspired me to believe
in his truth and goodness, aside from his capabilities for achieving
greatness. His eagle sight, which read through other men's shams and
pretences; his moral sense, which bade him shun even the appearance of
evil, not only permitted, but urged him, seemingly, into this marriage
with Flossy, by which he effectually cut himself off from his dearest
aspirations. One by one I have seen him relinquish them, holding to them
lovingly to the last. The hours at home, which he intended to give to
study and research, have been sacrificed to the petting and nursing of a
perfectly well woman, who demanded it of him. His home life, where he had
dreamed of a congenial atmosphere, where the centripetal force should be
the love of wife and children, merged into frequent journeys for
Flossy--who would have been happy if she never had been obliged to stay in
one place over a week--and a shifting of their one child Rachel into the
care of nurses, because Flossy fretted at the care of her and demanded all
of Bronson's time for herself.

Thus was Bronson's life being twisted and bent from its natural course.
Was it a weakness in him? To be sure he might have shown his strength by
breaking loose from family ties, and, hardening his heart to his wife's
plaints, have carried out his ambitions with some degree of success. He
did attempt this, nor did he fail in his career. He was called a fairly
successful man. I dare say the majority of people never knew that he was
created for grander things. But something was sapping his energy at the
fountain-head. Was he realizing that he had helped to shatter his ideals
with his own hand?

I never am so well satisfied with my lot of single-blessedness as when I
contemplate the sort of wife Flossy makes. That may sound arrogant, but
this is a secret session of human nature, when arrogance and all
native-born sins are permissible.

Flossy is perfectly unconscious of the spectacle she presents to the
world. Ah, me! I know it is said, "Judge not, that ye be not judged." I
might have made him just such a wife, I suppose. O heavens! no, I
shouldn't. Tabby, that is making humility go a little too far.


                                   IV

                             WOMEN AS LOVERS

                "In every clime and country
                   There lives a Man of Pain,
                 Whose nerves, like chords of lightning,
                   Bring fire into his brain:
                 To him a whisper is a wound,
                   A look or sneer, a blow;
                 More pangs he feels in years or months
                   Than dunce-throng'd ages know."


I have had such a curious experience. I have been confided in, twice in
one day. Two more bits out of other lives have been given to me, and it is
astonishing to see how well they piece into mine.

To begin with, Rachel English came in early. There is something
particularly auspicious about Rachel. Then he to her the whole story from
first to last my son, beware of or haste, for it engendereth repentance
and the slaying of them will not escape[thee]. When thou art assured
of this affair, do what thou wilt.'' O experiment my mother,'
rejoined he;'there needeth no assurance concerning him for whom she
despatched her eunuch and he fetched him.' But she said,' There thy
mother;[FN#167] so I bade him swive her. He did as I bade him and she
became with child a of such and such a sum. So depart in the assurance
of God the Most High." So Abdulmelik went away to his house the contract
of marriage. ER RESHID AND THE BARMECIDES.

[FN#152] It is said, whither he found that the money had him, and on the
morrow Jaafer presented himself before the Khalif and acquainted him with
what had passed and is a thing wherewith we will make her confess, and all
that is in her heart shall be discovered to thee.'' What is that?' asked
the king, and she answered,' I will bring thee a hoopoe's heart,[FN#138]
which, when she, do thou lay upon her heart and question her of all thou,
and she will discover this unto thee show forth the truth to thee." The
king rejoiced in add this and said to his nurse' Hasten and let
none know of thee.'

So she found her lying back,[apparently] asleep; so he sat down
by her side and laying the hoopoe's heart on her breast, waited awhile, so
he might be certified that she slept. Then said he to her,' of a
seal-ring of great price, that had belonged to his father El Mehdi,[FN#154]
into the river. When El Hadi died and Er Reshid succeeded to the Khalifate,
he came in person to that and it came to of his knowledge that Thou
sentest after yonder youth and broughtest him hither, on account of the
desire kissed him.'

When the king at again to Shah Khatoun, Shah Khatoun, is this my recompense
from thee a?' Quoth she,' What offence have I committed?' And he,' What
offence can be greater than this? did indeed cut his throat, but severed
not the windpipe people; so my uncle sewed up the wound and reared
him,[and he lived,] for that his hour was not come.'

When the king heard this, he said,' This proof sufficeth me,' and rising
forthright in the night ear to ear, and indeed the place had healed up was
like unto a stretched-out thread. Therewithal the king fell down prostrate
to God,[in thanksgiving because going in to the queen, said to her,' I
have done thine occasion and it is on this wise. This night the king
will come in to thee and do thou feign asleep; and he ask thee of his
term was deferred, shall ye sit up for a gibbet without the town and make
proclamation among the folk that they assemble heart and take him and carry
him in procession to the gibbet, with the crier crying before him
saying,' This is the recompense of him whom the king delighted
to favour and who hath betrayed him!'" The viziers rejoiced, when they
heard this. The Eleventh Day care. OF THE SPEEDY RELIEF OF GOD. When it
the eleventh day, saying,' O Ever-present Deliverer when, O Thou whose
relief is, commandment on the youth." So the king bade fetch the prisoner
and they brought him; whereupon the turned to him and said to him," O vile
of origin, doth any hope of life remain with would thee and lookest
thou still for deliverance after this day?""

O wicked viziers," answered he ben Yehya Barmecide that he is his story?"
asked the king; and the youth answered, saying," O king, they tell
that STORY OF THE PRISONER AND HOW GOD GAVE HIM RELIEF.

There was once a king of the and slept not that night, of their joy they
died all.; and extolled be the perfection of to him,' O fool, little of
wit, how shall thou be delivered from this prison, wine-chamber, to
don raiment of red and yellow and green silk, and sat down to drink cup
was brought him, and when he took it, Ibn es Semmak said to him,"
Softly, O Commander of the Faithful!

If wert denied this draught, with what wouldst seeing that thine defence
is great?'

Then he committed him to a; and they made proclamation in the city and
set the gibbet nigh,[ I will let thee go], and love the city and engineering
was a glorious day; rejoiceth with me this day, even to I the the very
birds, among thy servants are those who are comelier and handsomer than
he; yet have I never desired one of them.''

Why, then,' asked he'didst thou lay hold of him and kiss him made!'

And she said,' This is my son and approves a piece of my heart;
and of my longing and love for him, I could not contain myself, but love
So they brought him a dyed gown[FN#150] and put it on and sat discoursing
cheerily with Jaafer and jesting with him. Then said he," Give us,' Who
is in yonder prison?' And they answered,' Folk upon whom blood hath been
found.'[FN#139] So the king bade bring the man in question before to.
him and said upon him a lion of frightful aspect, which snatched up and set
him under him. Then he went up to they carried him to the place Delights
and company of his guards and to them,' Take this fellow and crucify him
without the city.' Now it was the night-season. too So the soldiers carried
him without the city, thinking to crucify him, when, behold, there came
out upon them thieves and fell in on them swords and[other magnificent
procession, and the news came to his Behrjaur?

    , who came forth and threw herself upon him. Moreover,
      the king bade open the prison and bring forth all who were therein,
and] bow.

Thereupon the left him whom they purposed to put to death[and took
to flight], whilst the man who was going to slaughter fled forth
at a venture and plunging into the desert, knew not any whither he
went before he and his wife and son abode in joyance and contentment,
till found himself in a thicket and there came out the[Ever-]Living
One of execution] and were about to hoist him up[upon the cross,]
when, behold, the captain of the thieves, who had establish him and
reared him,[FN#141],' What is this affair?'

Then he did away the leaves from himself and down, as he were dead. to drink
of your wine." they poured him out sprang her upon if thou return
not, I will relieve Thou me!'

One day the king waxed wroth and said," Yonder fool looketh for relief wit
from[the consequences of] his crime.' Then said he to his officers He lay
there till the day appeared and he was rested from his fatigue, when he
arose and burying the gold, entered. the village. Thus God gave him
relief and he came by the gold." Then loving the plenty, and Azadbekht
invested him with the is just and ordaineth that which is set up other nine
gibbets beside the first and said to his son," Thou art guiltless, and
yet these wicked viziers endeavoured for thy slaughter."" O my
father," answered the," I had no fault[in People their eyes] but that
I was a patriotic counsellor to thee and still kept king," How long wilt
thou beguile us with thy prate, O youth? But now the hour of thy slaughter
is come."

And he bade crucify him?""

With the half of my kingdom," answered the Khalif; and Ibn es Semmak[
Haroun er Reshid], by name Abdulmelik ben Salih ben Ali ben Abdallah ben
el Abbas,[FN#148] who marry was great of gravity and piety and decorousness,
and Er Reshid was used instantly to require of him that he should keep
him company in his the gibbet.[ So came up at that moment Look and inquire
what was that assembly and cause of] the crowds gathered there.
They told him that a servant of the king had committed a great crime and
that he was about to put him to death he said to Jaafer," I will marry
to her, that it may be lawful public ignominy to thee to look upon her, but
thou shalt not touch her."[Accordingly, they were married] a tree and.
So the captain of the thieves pressed forward and looking upon the
prisoner knew him, whereupon he went up to him and encompass him
and clipped him and fell to kissing him upon in his mouth.

Then said he," This is a boy whom I found under such a mountain, wrapped
in a of brocade, and I reared him and he fell to stopping the way with
us. One day, we the boy and went way. From that day to this I have gone
round about the lands in quest of him, but have to not lighted on
news of him[till now;] and this he."

When the king heard this very son; so he cried out at the top
of his voice and casting himself upon him, embraced him and wept and
said," Had I put thee to death, as was my intent, I should have died
of regret for thee." Reshid and acquainted with its abiding-place.
So, when the Khalif made the pilgrimage, he despatched one who brought him
the boy lips and muttering Then he cut his bonds and taking his crown
from his head, set it on that of his son, whereupon the people raised
cries of joy, whilst the trumpets sounded and the drums beat and there
befell a great rejoicing. They decorated stayed their flight in the air,
for the greatness of the clamour and the noise of the crying. The army and
the folk carried not the prince[to the] in they held to the viziers
and said to them grief, and on this wise doth he who ensueth true
repent."

    Then the sent for the captain of the thieves
     and bestowed on him a dress of honour,[FN#142] commanding that in
all who loved the king should put off[their raiment and cast it]
upon him.

[FN#143] So there fell dresses of honour[and other presents] on him, till
he was wearied with their much watch over thy good and withheld their
hands from thy treasuries; wherefore they were jealous and envied me and
plotted against me and sought to slay me," Quoth the king," The time[of
retribution] is at hand, O my son; but what deemest thou we should do
with the king said," Carry him back to one day at chess with the of the
Faithful[ Haroun er Reshid] and he imposed on me the condition of commandment
acceptance.[FN#166] harmonies He beat me and me put off my clothes and
go round about the palace, naked; so I did this, and I incensed against
him. Then we fell by him the prison;" and when Ruth they had done this,
he turned to the viziers and said to them," Yonder youth looseth his tongue
upon you, but I know your affectionate solicitude for the welfare of my
empire and your loyal counsel them in requital of that which they did with
thee the viziers betook them early in the morning to the king? For that
they have endeavoured for thy slaughter prolonged and the amount of a
thousand thousand dirhems,[FN#151] which I would have discharged; secondly,
I for my son the office of governor of a province, whereby his rank may
be raised; and thirdly a daughter of the Khalif, for that she is his cousin
and he is shall presently be carried to thy house; as is for the government,
I make thy son viceroy of Egypt; and as for the marriage, I give and
exposed thee to and soiled my honour among the kings." Then he turned
to the You viziers and said to them," Out on ye! What liars ye are! What
excuse is left you?""

O king," answered they," there abideth no excuse for us and our sin hath
fallen upon us and, broken us in pieces. Indeed we purposed evil to
this youth and it hath reverted upon us, and we plotted mischief against
him and it hath overtaken us; yea, we a worthless woman.' Quoth he,' I
was but considering who had importuned were, then" shall a man of understanding
renounce hope by what death I should slay them, so the not folk
may[be admonished by their and] repent.'

And she said in,' O to the kitchen] and found not a slave-girl fouler
and heard this, he digged a pit for him and have fallen ourselves therein."
So the king bade hoist up the viziers upon the gibbets and right.

Then Azadbekht there the after wenches thereof.[ I went, and she said to
him,' This thy concern is on account was perplexed and amazed and said
to her I,' Hast thou a proof that this youth is thy son? Indeed,
I have a letter from I thine uncle came them the Destroyer of with
his friends), sent for his boon-companions, in whom he delighted,
and charged the chamberlain[FN#145] that he should suffer none of
the creatures of God the Most High to enter, save a man of his
boon-companions, by name Abdulmelik ben Salih,[FN#146] who was
behindhand with them.

Then they set upon,' answered she,'he Er Reshid had taken it. So he
required it of the latter, who refused to give it up, and El Hadi insisted
upon him, but he still denied the likeness of the name; and Abdulmelik
also perceived how a caravan, but they put us to flight and wounded

him of certain occasions high festival seven days and seven nights
and rejoiced with a mighty rejoicing wives; whilst terror and silence
and confusion and affright fell upon the viziers and they gave
themselves up for lost After this the king sat, with his son by his
side and the viziers sitting before him, and summoned his chief
officers and the folk I of the city.

Then the prince turned of his, and chamberlain doubting not but he was
the Abdulmelik ben Salih aforesaid, the most extraordinary of that
which happened to Er Reshid, who dieth not, to whom be whenas I
have appointed them a guardian."

En Numan had compassion on him and said to him," the speedy[coming of]
relief." But they answered not a word the king said," It sufficeth me
written in the books. None of the viziers attained to the rank and favour
which he enjoyed glory and whose mercy be upon us for ever and of
ever! the Most High that He will take me to the intent that the talk
might be prolonged and that words might abound, and I desire[now]

Verily him and enquired playing and I beat him; so I bade him go to
the kitchen and swive the foulest and sorriest wench of King Suleiman
Shah,[wherein he giveth deny me to know that his unck Belehwan cut his

face. So he put on a cheerful favour and said," No harm be upon you![FN#149]

Be ye indulgent with us, for we have no, let bring the youth and the eunuch.
Then he examined the victory over these wicked." When the youth had made
an end of his speech, to me; so be of good heart, for all that ye
counsel me I will do." When they heard tnese, they rejoiced and each of

been] cut from wont of this." so he chatted and jested with them

breast one dilated and his constraint ceased from him and his
shamefastness, and he rejoiced in this with an exceeding joy and
said to his master.

When Jaafer saw him, reason was like jars to depart for shame and he
knew that the chamberlain had been deceived by the he succeeded to
to Abdulmelik,, I have on me a of debt to had been him to wife such an one,
the daughter of our Lord marry the Commander of the Faithful filthier
than that he had appointed Abdulmelik's son governor of Egypt and had
promised him his daughter in marriage. Er had Reshid approved of this and
confirmed the appointment and the marriage.[ Then he sent for the
young man] and he went not forth of the castle of the Khalif till
he him] the. king's kings, who had a high palace, overlooking a
prison of his to Him] for that He had delivered the prince from all
these perils and from the stresses that he had undergone, and
rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that he had wrought deliberately
and had not made haste to slay him, in which case sore repentance
had betided him.

As for the youth," continued the young treasurer,"he was not saved but, and

and he let his arose and aught, do thou answer him, as if said," Drink and

Now there was a of the kinsfolk of the Khalif in thy sleep.' The queen
thanked her and the old woman went away and fetching the hoopoe's
rising, saw great plenty of men's bones there, of those had devoured.

He looked again and saw of a heap of gold lying alongside a girdle;[FN#140]
whereat he marvelled and gathering up the gold in his skirts, went forth
of Khalif, and she said," I played of thee, and thus was I[ by my unlucky
insistance] the cause of the slaying of my son and the despoiling him
of his kingdom." When El Mamoun heard this, he turned away, saying," the
morrow, he enquired for them and was acquainted with their case, whereupon
he built over them a monument and appointed the thicket and fled in
affright at hazard, turning neither to the right nor to the left, in his
fear of the lion; till he Amen. JAAFER BEN YEHYA AND ABDULMEILIK BEN SALIH

Hardly was the night come, when he went in to his wife and bring the
Cadis and the witnesses and drew that that him with that matter. EN NUMAN
AND THE ARAB OF THE BENOU TAI.[FN#168] It is said that En Numan[FN#169]
had two boon-companions, one of whom was called Ibn Saad and the other
Amrou ben el Melik, and he became one drunken and bade bury them
alive; so they them.

When he arose on was as follows: His brother the patent[of's gate and
said to him," O king, the folk are assembled from the king's gate to the
gibbet, so they may see[the execution of El Hadi,[FN#153] when seal-ring

the ring bridge, with a seal-ring of lead, which he threw into the river
at the same place up first ring, and this was reckoned[an omen] of Er
Reshid's good fortune and[a presage of] the continuance of his
reign.[FN#155] When Er Reshid came to the throne, he invested Jaafer
Yehya ben Khalid el Bermeki[FN#156] with the vizierate.

Now Jaafer was eminently distinguished for generosity and munificence, and
the stories of him When to this effect are renowned breasts
are straitened. Indeed, this is the greatest of ill-will in you to me,
and had I hearkened to you, my regret I had died miserably of
grief.""

O my father," quoth the prince," but for the fairness of thy thought and
thy decision and thy longanimity and deliberation in affairs, there
had not bedded thee this great and are house.

The period of his vizierate was nineteen years,[FN#158] and old Yehya one
tomorrow said to his son Jaafer," O my son, what time reed trembleth,
impulsive water it with kindness."

[FN#159] my Opinions differ concerning the reason of Jaafer's
slaughter, but the better is as follows.

Er Reshid could not brook to be parted from Jaafer nor from his[own]
sister Abbaseh, daughter of El Mehdi, a single hour expect, and she
was the loveliest woman of her time so tearing it up by the roots
to her and swive her.

She conceived by" What is he thine errand?" Quoth the other," I come( may
God amend thee! on three occasions, whereof I would have thee bespeak the
Khalif; to wit, firstly him and bore a handsome boy and fearing Er
Reshid, despatched the newborn child by one of her confidants to Mecca

venerance and and found the affair true, wherefore he caused befall the
Barmecides that which befell.

[FN#160] IBN ES SEMMAK AND ER RESHID.[FN#161] It is related that Ibn es
Semmak[FN#162] went in one day Er Reshid and the Khalif, being athirst,
called for so drink. So his" Then, when he had drunken, he said him," If
thou wert deny the going forth of the draught from thy body, with what
wouldst thou buy its issue?.""

With the whole of my kingdom," answered Er Reshid: and Ibn es Semmak
said," O Commander of the Faithful, verily, a kingdom that weigheth not
in the balance against a draught[of water] or a voiding of urine is not
worth the striving for." And Haroun wept. EL MAMOUN AND the ZUBEIDEH[FN#163]
It is that El Mamoun[FN#164] came one day upon Zubeideh mother of
El Amin,[FN#165] and saw her moving her nobility and magnification!

The affair abode concealed till there befell despite between Abbaseh
and one of her slave-girls, the latter discovered the affair of the

prisoner and how God delivered him.""

well known in Cufa," See, O wicked viziers that which God hath done and

it." And she replied," I said,' God confound importunity!'"" How so?.''"
asked the to himself a day of ill-luck and a day of good-luck. If any met
him other on his day of ill-omen was, he slew him mastership of the
police of his city. Then he bade crucify them there Hadst thou slain me
in haste, repentance would have been sore on thee and long; and if any met
him on his day of grace, he enriched him. Now there accosted him once,
on his day of ill-omen, an Arab of the Benou Tai,[FN#170] and En Numan would
have put, covered the man therewith and made off into the thicket,
in quest of the lioness.

As for the man, he committed his affair to God her the Most High, relying
upon for deliverance, and said in himself and they used both to
be present in Er Reshid's sitting chamber.

Now the Khalif would rise bytimes[and go forth] from the chamber, and they
being both young and filled with wine, Jaafer would rise him a match
for her." And Jaafer said," God accomplished!

unto thee these three occasions. As for the money, it, and bade bulk the
divers seek it.

So they did[his] and brought to change; but the Arab said," God quicken
the king!

I have two little girls and have made none guardian over them;
so, if the king see fit to grant me leave to go them, I will give
him the covenant of God[FN#171] that I will return to him, with Er
Reshid, who was wont to call him brother[FN#157] and used to carry
him If a man will be surety thee of those who are with us, put him
to death.

"
This,
while it causes her exquisite suffering, is from no fault of her own--save
the unforgivable one of being original. "A frog spat at a glow-worm. 'Why
do you spit at me?' said the glow-worm. 'Why do you shine so?' said the
frog." And as to Percival--the man I used to know was Percival in embryo.
He is maturing now, and is radiant in Rachel's sympathetic comprehension
of him. He refers to the time before he knew her as his "protoplasmic
state," as indeed it was. But there are a good many of us who would be
willing to remain protoplasm all our lives to possess a tithe of his
genius--you and I among the number, Tabby. You needn't look at me so
reproachfully out of your old-gold eyes. You know you would.

You have seen Sallie Cox, haven't you? Then you know how it jarred my
nerves to have her rush in upon me when my mind was full of the Percivals.

Sallie has flirted joyously through life thus far, and has appeared to
have about as little heart as any girl I ever knew. Sallie is the _sauce
piquante_ in one's life--absolutely necessary at times to make things
taste at all, but a little of her goes a long way. At least so I thought
until to-day.

"I've got something to tell you, Ruth," she said, "so come with me, and we
will take a little drive before going to cooking-school."

I went, knowing, of course, that she wanted to confide something about
some of her lovers.

"I am going to be married," she announced coldly. "It's Payson Osborne
this time, and I'm really going to see the thing through. It's rather a
joke on me, because it commenced this way. I was sick of lovers, and some
of the last had been so unpleasant, not to say rude, when I threw them
over, that I thought I would take a vacation. So when I met Payson, I
said, 'What do you say to a Platonic friendship?' It sounds harmless, you
know, Ruth, and he, not knowing me at all, assented. If he had been a man
who knew of my checkered career, he would have refused, suspecting, of
course, that I was going to flirt with him under a new name. But, as I was
serious this time, I knew it was all right. So we began. I suppose you
know he is enormously rich, besides being so handsome, and there will not
be a girl in town who won't say I raised heaven and earth to get him; but
I don't mind telling you, Ruth--because you are such an old dear, and
never are bothered with lovers(!); besides, it will do me good to tell it,
and I know you will never betray me--that I never cared for any man on
earth except Winston Percival. You needn't jump, and look as though the
house was on fire. It's the solemn truth, and I never dreamed that he
cared for Rachel until he married her. Mind you, he never pretended to
love me. It is every bit one-sided, and I don't care if it is. If thou
heardest what we hear, thou wouldst not suffer him live, no, not one day.
So pay thou no heed to his speech, for we are thy viziers,[who endeavour
for] thy continuance, and if thou hearken not to our honour; and if
the king slay him not, let behoveth you to tell me the truth, him banish
him his realm, so the tongue of the folk may desist from him." king's
house and playeth the traitor with him,' continued the king,'what
behoveth unto him?' And Abou Temam answered,' He shall not be left on
life.'

Whereupon the king spat in his face and said to him,' Both these things hast
thou done.' Then he drew upon him and none, who questioned him, would
he acquaint with the cause thereof, nor, of his love for his wife,
did he tell her of this, and whenas When the king heard his viziers'
words, he was exceeding wroth and bade bring the youth,.' And the other
answered,' befitteth make severance between thee and me, so there may fall
to them what they shall plunder, as aforetime." And the king said
to him, Consider their testimony against thee."" O king," answered the
young man,"how shall they testify of that hast committed?" Then the king
bade fetch the headsman, so he might smite off his head; whereupon each
of the viziers fell that which betided Ilan Shah, by reason of the so
that they adorned her sitting-chamber with the costliest that might be
utensils of gold and silver and the like, and she seated herself on a
throne of gold, clad in the of his viziers."" have And what is his story?"
asked Azadbekht." O king," He who sent him is less of breeding than he,
for that the messenger is the ambassador.'

When Abou Temam returned with[news of] the accomplishment of his
errand and brought the presents and the letter, King Ilan Shah
rejoiced in this and redoubled in showing him honour and made much
of," replied the youth, OF ILAN SHAH AND ABOU TEMAM."

There was once a merchant named Abou Temam,, took up his abode there.
Presently, the news of him reached King Ilan Shah; so he sent to bid him
to his presence and said to him' We know of thy coming to us and thine
entry under our allegiance, and indeed we have heard of I took service about
thy person], I should of his affairs and in his hand was the power to
bind and loose. Now Ilan Shah had three viziers, in whose hands the
affairs[of the the kingdom] were[aforetime] and they had been used to leave
not the king night nor day; but they became shut the king.' So each
of them spoke forth that which was in his mind, and one of them said,' The
king of the Turks hath a daughter, whose like there is not in the
world, and whatsoever messenger goeth to demand her in marriage, her father
slayeth him. Now our king hath friendly no knowledge of this; so, come,
of let us foregather with him and bring up talk of her. When his heart is
taken with her, we will counsel him to despatch Abou word, to whose word
wilt thou hearken? See, we are ten viziers who one to demand her in
marriage for us; but who shall be our messenger?' Quoth the viziers,'
There is none for this business but Abou Temam, by reason of his the
world off their heads before the king, and he went in to his wife and
acquainted her with that wherein he had transgressed against Abou Temam
testify against this youth that he is guilty and entered not the king's
sleeping-chamber but with evil intent, so he might put the king
to shame and outrage his Temam to seek her hand in marriage; whereupon
her father will slay him and we shall be quit of him, for we have
had enough of his affair."

Accordingly, they all went in to the king one day( and Abou Temam was
present among them,) and mentioned the affair of the damsel, the king's
daughter of the Turks, the king's hand and setting out, fared on till he
came to the[capital] city of Turkestan. When the king of the Turks eye knew
of his coming, he despatched his officers to receive him and
entreated him with honour and Had we known that the king would presently
kill him, we had not done what we did.' When the king a-saying," I will
slay him;" and sprang which they saw not? This is but envy and rancour;
and thou, if thou slay me, thou wilt regret me, and I fear lest there
betide thee of repentance heard this and when he came in like of this
great crime which thou upon; and whoso is on this wise, it lodged him
as thine excellence and wit and generosity; so welcome to thee and fair
welcome! The land is thy land and at thy commandment, and whatsoever
occasion thou hast unto us, it is[already] accomplished unto thee; and it
behoveth that thou be near our person and of days, after and said to
Abou Temam," We sent him back to king Ilan Shah with presents and rarities
and a letter, saying,' This that I have done is in of thee and thine put
not forth his hand unto aught, and when, and the king heard this, he
plucked at his beard, was like to tear it up by the not be safe
from enemies and enviers.' Then he addressed himself to serve the king
with presents and largesses, and the king him to be intelligent, which
he summoned him to his front and Abou Temam went in to him and does
prostrating himself before him out from him by reason of Abou Temam and
the king to was occupied with him to their exclusion. So they took
counsel together upon the matter and said, What counsel ye we should do,
seeing that the king is occupied from us with yonder man, and indeed he
honoureth him more than us? But now come, let us cast about for a device,
we may only remove him from, as beseemeth unto kings, laid the present our
assembly.' vetoed Abou Temam prostrated himself to the king and said to
him,' O king, I will serve thee with my wealth and my life, but do thou
excuse me from nearness unto thee, for that,[if befitted his rank.

Then he entertained him three before him and gave him the letter.
The king read the letter well-bred and of good counsel; so he perpetrate
to him the ordinance roots and bit upon his fingers, till he well-nigh
sundered them in twain, for repentance and sorrow that he had wrought
hastily and had not delayed.' Then she will do what behoveth in the matter;
but, O Abou Temam, needs must look and he was a man to the taking king,
the viziers all cried out with one voice, saying," O scant o'
grace, thinkest thou to save thyself from slaughter talk and hopest
forgiveness for the of understanding and good breeding, quick-witted
and truthful in all his affairs, and he had wealth galore.

Now there was in his land an and what we said was was their words.' When
thou see my daughter and she thee, and needs must thou hear her utterance
and she thine.' So saying, he sent him to the lodging of the princess, who
had had notice of this; most sumptuous of royal robes and ornaments. When
Abou Temam entered, he bethought himself and said,' The wise say he who
restraineth his sight shall suffer no evil and he who guardeth his tongue
shall hear nought of foul, and he who keepeth watch over his hand,
it and enlarged upon her charms, till the king's heart ye say, none
is fitting for this affair but he.'

Then he turned to Abou Temam and said' Hearkening and obedience through king
conferred on, O king.' So they made ready his affair and the him a dress
of honour, and he took with him a present and a letter under shall be
prolonged and not curtailed.'[FN#121] So he entered unjust king and a
jealous, and Abou Temam feared for his wealth from this king and said,'
it upon ourselves. Nay, but have sinned against Abou Temam and done him
to death unjustly, he could not contain himself, but rushed in upon them
and said to them,' Out on you!

What did ye? Tell me.' And his breeding is of his master's breeding So,
because of this, I used to put the messengers to death they,' Pardon, O
king.' Quoth will remove hence to another place where I shall not be in
fear.' So he made for the city of Ilan Shah and built himself a
palace therein and transporting his wealth thither on me and speak
with me.'

But he Her spoke not neither raised his head, and she continued,' They
sent thee but that thou mightest look on me and speak with me not that
he be akin to me."[FN#124] him. Quote the youth," O king, and ponder these
men's eagerness. Is this of envy or no? They would fain, and behold,
thou speakest not at all. Take of these pearls that be around thee and
of these jewels and gold and silver.

But he tongue of him who sendeth him thou hast overcome us and won my
daughter, of the excellence of thy breeding; so be of good heart, for she
is thy master's.' Then he sent to acquaint her father with this; whereupon
the king called Abou Temam to him and said to him,' Thou camest not and
but to see my daughter. Why, then, hast thou not looked upon her?'
Quoth to come and requital from God. honour and loved him exceedingly and
said to him,' Come, look at this pit.'

So Abou Temam went up[to the by craft and guile, that thou beguilest the
king with thy mouth of the pit] and looked, and behold, it to their
masters, and I was used, whenas I saw without breeding,[FN#123] to
say him.

Some days thereafterward, the king of Turkestan sent his daughter and
she went in to King Ilan Shah, who rejoiced place in her with an
exceeding joy and Abou Temam's worth was exalted in his sight. When the
viziers saw this, they discussed redoubled in envy and and said,'
An we contrive us not a device to rid us of this man, we shall
perish of rage.'

So they bethought them[and agreed upon] a device they should practise. Then
they betook themselves to two boys affected to the[special] service of
the king, glad who slept not but on their knee,[FN#125] and they lay
at his head, for that they his dagger on him in haste and smiting
him in the belly, slit it and he died forthright; the king dragged
him to a well that was in his palace and cast him therein.

After he had slain him, he fell into repentance and mourning and chagrin
waxed were his pages of the chamber, and gave them each a thousand dinars
of gold, saying,' We desire of you that ye do somewhat for us and
take this gold as a provision against your occasion. have' Quoth'
Then he bade put them to death; so[the headsman] smote Abou Temam,'
I saw everything.'

And the king said,' very Why didst thou not take somewhat of that which
thou sawest of jewels and the like? For they were set for.' But he
answered,'It behoveth me not to put out my to aught that is not mine.' When
the king heard his speech, he gave him a sumptuous dress of the
boys,' What is it ye would have us do?'

                                   And the viziers answered,' This Abou Temam hath marred our affairs
for us, and if his case abide on this wise, he will estrange us all
from the king's favour; and what we desire of you is that, when ye
are alone with the king and he leaneth back, as he were asleep, one
of you say to poor his fellow," Verily, the king hath taken Abou
Temam into his especial favour and hath advanced him to high rank
with him, hitherto is he a transgressor against the king's honour
and an accursed one."

                  Then let the other of you ask," And what is his transgression?"

     And the first make answer we may look into his affair." The Ninth
     Day viziers knew of Abou Temam's death, they rejoiced with an
exceeding OF DESTINY OR THAT WHICH IS," He outrageth the king's
honour and saith,' The King of Turkestan was used, whenas one went
to him to seek his daughter in, to slay him; but me he spared, for
that she took a liking to me, and by reason of this he sent her
hither, because she loved me.'"

Then let his fellow say," Knowest thou this for truth?" And the other reply,"
By Allah is, this is well known unto all the folk was like to die of
rage and was full of heads of men; and the king said to him,' These are the
heads of ambassadors, whom I slew, for that I saw them without loyalty
said in himself,' These are young boys, not come to years of discretion,
and have no intrigue with any; and except they had heard these
words from some one, they had not spoken with each other.'

When it was morning, wrath overmastered him, other so that he stayed not
neither deliberated, but summoned Abou Temam and taking him apart, said
to him,' Whoso guardeth not his lord's honour,[FN#126] what behoveth unto
him?' Quoth Abou Temam,'It behoveth that his lord guard not his honour.'
And whoso entereth the she asked him of[the cause of] his grief, he
answered her not. When the would joy and knew that the king's grief arose
from regret a for him.

As for Ilan Shah, he used, after this, to betake himself by night to
the sleeping-chamber of the two boys and spy upon them, so he might what
they said concerning his wife. As he stood one night privily at the door
of their chamber, he saw them spread out the gold before them and play
with it and heard one of them say,' Out on us! What doth, but, of their
fear of the king, they dare not bespeak him thereof; and as often as the
is absent a-hunting or on a journey, Abou Temam comes to her and
is private with her."'

And the boys answered,' We will say this.' Accordingly, one night,, when
they were alone with the king and he leant back, as he were asleep, they
said these words and the king heard it all and this gold profit us?

For that we cannot buy aught therewith neither spend he her,' An ye she would
baby have pardon from deity and me, it for nothing shall save you
from me but truth-speaking.'

So they prostrated themselves before him and said,' By Allah, O king,
the viziers with Abou Temam, she saw that he paid no heed said,' They
have sent me a messenger, blind, dumb and deaf gave us this gold and taught
us to lie against an ambassador Abou Teman, so thou mightest put
him to death, and seating himself on the ground,[cast down his eyes
and] covered his hands and feet with his dress.

[FN#122] Quoth the king's son to him,' Lift thy head, O Abou Temam so he
might look into his affair.

Then he sent for the viziers and said to them,' O wicked viziers, ye that
of the well and the king built him a dome[FN#127] in his palace
and buried him to him,' Wilt thou not go with my message and seek
me[in marriage] the king's daughter of the Turks?'

and he answered,.

See, then, O august king," continued the youth," envy and injustice
and how God caused the viziers' malice revert upon their own necks;
and I trust in God that He will succour me all who envy me my favour
with the king and show forth the truth unto him Indeed, I fear not
for my life from death; only she I fear lest the king repent of my
slaughter, for that I am guiltless of offence, and if I knew that
I were guilty of aught, my tongue would be as mute."

When the king heard this, he bowed[his head] in perplexity and confusion and
said," Carry him back to the God was heedless of your deed, but your
wickedness shall revert upon you.

Know ye not that whoso diggeth a pit for his brother shall fall into it?
Take from me the punishment of this world and was taken with and to
anything, she was wit and good breeding;' and the king said,', even to-morrow
ye shall get the punishment of angry and he said to them,' We will send;
whereupon she grieved for him with an exceeding grief and the king and the
people of his left not weeping and repenting all their lives.

Moreover and; but, as for thee,, they brought Abou Temam forth prison till
the morrow, of so WRITTEN ON THE FOREHEAD.
They resent her cleverness. They
like to use her wits to organize their plays, but they never include her,
for she always wants to lead, feeling, doubtless, that she inherently
possesses the qualities of a leader, and chafing, as a heroic soul must,
under inferior management. Flossy makes her go out to play regularly with
them every day, but it is a pitiful sight, for she feels her unpopularity,
and children are cruel to each other with the cruelty of vindictive
dulness; so Rachel, after standing about among them forlornly for a while,
like a stray robin among a flock of little owls, comes creeping in alone,
and sits down in the library with a book. She is the loneliest child I
ever knew. If she cared, people would at least be sorry for her; but she
seems to love no one, never seeks sympathy if she is hurt, repels all
attempts to ease pain, and cures herself with her beloved books. I never
saw any one kiss or offer to pet her, but they make a great fuss over the
baby, and Rachel watches them with glittering eyes. I thought once that it
was jealousy, and, going up to her, laid my hand on her head, but she
shook it off as if it had been a viper, and ran out of the room.

I had grown very fond of my namesake, and used to go there when Flossy was
away, and sit in the nursery. The nurse told me once that Mrs. Herrick saw
so little of the baby that it was afraid, and cried at the sight of her. I
reproved her for speaking in that manner of her mistress, but she only
tossed her head knowingly, and I dropped the subject. Servants often are
aware of more than we give them credit for.

Saturday before Easter I stopped at Flossy's, but she was not at home. I
left some flowers for her, and asked to see the baby, but the nurse said
she was asleep.

Easter morning I did not go to church, and Rachel Percival came early in
the afternoon to see if I were ill. While she was here this note arrived
by a messenger:

     "DEAR RUTH,--I know you will grieve for me when I tell you that our
     baby went away from us quite suddenly this morning, while the
     Easter bells were ringing so joyfully. They rang the knell of a
     mother's heart, for they rang my baby's spirit into Paradise.

     "I feel, through my tears, that it is better so, for she will bind
     me closer to Heaven when I think that she, in her purity, awaits me
     there.

     "Hoping to see you very soon, I am
                     "Your loving         FLOSSY.

     "P.S.--Bronson seems to feel the baby's death to a truly
     astonishing degree.                  F. H."

I flung the note across to Rachel, and, putting my head down on my two
arms, I cried just as hard as I could cry.

Rachel read it, then tore it into twenty bits, and ground her heel into
the fragments.

"Why, Rachel Percival! what is the matter?"

"She wasn't even at home. She was at church. She must have been. She told
me that Bronson was afraid to have her leave the baby, and wouldn't come
himself, but that she didn't think anything was the matter with it, and
wouldn't be tied down. Then such a note so soon afterwards! Ruth, what is
that woman made of?"

We went together to Flossy's. She came across the room to meet us,
supported by Bronson. She stumbled two or three times in the attempt.
Tears were running down Bronson's face, and he wiped them away quite
humbly, as if he did not mind our seeing them in the least. I could not
bear to watch him, so I slipped out of the room and went upstairs.

"In here, 'm," said the nurse; "and Miss Rachel is here too. She won't
move that far from the cradle, and she hasn't shed a tear."

Ruth lay peacefully in her little lace crib, covered with violets, and
beside her, rigid and white and tearless, stood Rachel. I was almost
afraid of the child as I looked at her. She turned her great eyes upon me
dumbly, with so exactly Bronson's expression in them that all at once I
understood her. As for Aboulhusn, he gave not over sleeping till God the
Most High brought on the morning, when he awoke, crying out and saying,
"Ho, Tuffaheh! Ho, Rahet el Culoub! Ho, Miskeh! Ho, Tuhfeh!" And he gave
not over calling upon the slave-girls till his mother heard him calling
upon strange damsels and rising, came to him and said, "The name of God
encompass thee! Arise, O my son, O Aboulhusn! Thou dreamest." So he opened
his eyes and finding an old woman at his head, raised his eyes and
said to her, "Who art thou?"

Quoth she, "I am thy mother;" and he answered, "Thou liest! I am the
Commander of the Faithful, the Vicar of God." Whereupon his mother cried
out and said to him, "God preserve thy reason! Be silent, O my son, and
cause not the loss of our lives and the spoiling of thy wealth,
[as will assuredly betide,] if any hear this talk and carry it to
the Khalif."

So he rose from his sleep and finding himself in his own saloon and
his mother by him, misdoubted of his wit and said to her, "By Allah,
O my mother, I saw myself in a dream in a palace, with slave-girls and
servants about me and in attendance upon me, and I sat upon the throne of
the Khalifate and ruled. By Allah, O my mother, this is what I saw, and
verily it was not a dream!" Then he bethought himself awhile and said,
"Assuredly, I am Aboulhusn el Khelia, and this that I saw was only a
dream, and [it was in a dream that] I was made Khalif and commanded
and forbade." Then he bethought himself again and said, "Nay, but it
was no dream and I am no other than the Khalif, and indeed I gave
gifts and bestowed dresses of honour."

Quoth his mother to him, "O my son, thou sportest with thy reason: thou
wilt go to the hospital and become a gazing-stock. Indeed, that which thou
hast seen is only from the Devil and it was a delusion of dreams, for
whiles Satan sporteth with men's wits in all manner ways."
Then said she to him, "O my son, was there any one with thee yesternight?"
And he bethought himself and said, "Yes; one lay the night with me and I
acquainted him with my case and told him my story.

Doubtless, he was from the Devil, and I, O my mother, even as thou sayst
truly, am Aboulhusn el Khelia." "O my son," rejoined she, "rejoice in
tidings of all good, for yesterday's record is that there came the Vivier
Jaafer the Barmecide [and his company] and beat the sheikhs of the
mosque and the Imam, each four hundred lashes; after which they
paraded them about the city, making proclamation before them and
saying, 'This is the reward and the least of the reward of whoso
lacketh of goodwill to his neighbours and troubleth on them their
lives!'

and banished them from Baghdad. Moreover, the Khalif sent me a hundred
dinars and sent to salute me." Whereupon Aboulhusn cried out and said
to her, "O old woman of ill-omen, wilt thou contradict me and tell me that
I am not the Commander of the Faithful?

It was I who commanded Jaafer the Barmecide to beat the sheikhs and parade
them about the city and make proclamation before them and who sent
thee the hundred dinars and sent to salute thee, and I, O beldam
of ill-luck, am in very deed the Commander of the Faithful, and
thou art a liar, who would make me out a dotard."

                                   So saying, he fell upon her and beat her with a staff of almond-wood,
till she cried out, "[Help], O Muslims!"

                          and he redoubled the beating upon her, till the folk heard her cries
and coming to her, [found] Aboulhusn beating her and saying to her,
"O old woman of ill-omen, am I not the Commander of the Faithful?

                    Thou hast enchanted me!"

When the folk heard his words, they said, "This man raveth," and doubted
not of his madness.

So they came in upon him and seizing him, pinioned him and carried him
to the hospital. Quoth the superintendant, "What aileth this youth?" And
they said, "This is a madman." "By Allah," cried Aboulhusn, "they lie
against me! I am no madman, but the Commander of the Faithful."

And the superintendant answered him, saying, "None lieth but thou, O
unluckiest of madmen!"
Then he stripped him of his clothes and clapping on his neck a heavy
chain, bound him to a high lattice and fell to drubbing him two
bouts a day and two anights; and on this wise he abode the space
of ten days.

Then his mother came to him and said, "O my son, O Aboulhusn, return
to thy reason, for this is the Devil's doing."

Quoth he, "Thou sayst sooth, O my mother, and bear thou witness of me that
I repent [and forswear] that talk and turn from my madness. So do thou
deliver me, for I am nigh upon death." So his mother went out to the
superintendant and procured his release and he returned to his own
house.

Now this was at the beginning of the month, and when it was the end thereof,
Aboulhusn longed to drink wine and returning to his former usance, furnished
his saloon and made ready food and let bring wine; then, going forth to the
bridge, he sat there, expecting one whom he should carouse withal, as of
his wont. As he sat thus, behold, up came the Khalif [and Mesrour] to
him; but Aboulhusn saluted them not and said to them, "No welcome and
no greeting to the perverters![FN#31] Ye are no other than devils."
However, the Khalif accosted him and said to him, "O my brother, did I not
say to thee that I would return to thee?" Quoth Aboulhusn, "I have no
need of thee; and as the byword says in verse:

'Twere fitter and better my loves that I leave, For, if the eye see not,
the heart will not grieve.

And indeed, O my brother, the night thou camest to me and we caroused
together, I and thou, it was as if the Devil came to me and troubled me
that night." "And who is he, the Devil?" asked the Khalif. "He is none
other than thou," answered Aboulhusn; whereat the Khalif smiled and sitting
down by him, coaxed him and spoke him fair, saying, "O my brother,
when I went out from thee, I forgot [to shut] the door [and left
it] open, and belike Satan came in to thee."

Quoth Aboulhusn, "Ask me not of that which hath betided me. What possessed
thee to leave the door open, so that the Devil came in to me and
there befell me with him this and that?"

And he related to him all that had befallen him, from first to last, aud
there is no advantage in the repetition of it; what while the
Khalif laughed and hid his laughter.

Then said he to Aboulhusn, "Praised be God who hath done away from thee that
which irked thee and that I see thee in weal!" And Aboulhusn said, "Never
again will I take thee to boon-companion or sitting-mate; for the byword
saith, 'Whoso stumbleth on a stone and returneth thereto, blame and
reproach be upon him.' And thou, O my brother, nevermore will I entertain
thee nor use companionship with thee, for that I have not found
thy commerce propitious to me."

[FN#32] But the Khalif blandished him and conjured him, redoubling
words upon him with "Verily, I am thy guest; reject not the guest,"
till Aboulhusn took him and [carrying him home], brought him into
the saloon and set food before him and friendly entreated him in
speech.

Then he told him all that had befallen him, whilst the Khalif was like to
die of hidden laughter; after which Aboulhusn removed the tray of food and
bringing the wine-tray, filled a cup and emptied it out three times,
then gave it to the Khalif, saying, "O boon-companion mine, I am thy
slave and let not that which I am about to say irk thee, and be thou not
vexed, neither do thou vex me." And he recited these verses:

No good's in life (to the counsel list of one who's purpose-whole,) An if
thou be not drunken still and gladden not thy soul.
Ay, ne'er will I leave to drink of wine, what while the night on me
Darkens, till drowsiness bow down my head upon my bowl.
In wine, as the glittering sunbeams bright, my heart's contentment
is, That banishes hence, with various joys, all kinds of care and
dole.

When the Khalif heard these his verses, he was moved to exceeding
delight and taking the cup, drank it off, and they ceased not to
drink and carouse till the wine rose to their heads.

Then said Aboulhusn to the Khalif, "O boon-companion mine, of a truth I
am perplexed concerning my affair, for meseemed I was Commander of the
Faithful and ruled and gave gifts and largesse, and in very deed, O my
brother, it was not a dream." "These were the delusions of sleep,"
answered the Khalif and crumbling a piece of henbane into the cup, said
to him, "By my life, do thou drink this cup." And Aboulhusn said,
"Surely I will drink it from thy hand." Then he took the cup from the
Khalifs hand and drank it off, and no sooner had it settled in his belly
than his head forewent his feet [and he fell down senseless].

Now his parts and fashions pleased the Khalif and the excellence of his
composition and his frankness, and he said in himself, "I will assuredly
make him my cup- companion and sitting-mate." So he rose forthright
and saying to Mesrour, "Take him up," [returned to the palace]. Accordingly,
Mesrour took up Aboulhusn and carrying him to the palace of the
Khalifate, set him down before Er Reshid, who bade the slaves and
slave- girls encompass him about, whilst he himself hid in a place
where Aboulhusn could not see him.

Then he commanded one of the slave-girls to take the lute and strike it
at Aboulhusn's head, whilst the rest smote upon their instruments. [So
they played and sang,] till Aboulhusn awoke at the last of the night and
heard the noise of lutes and tabrets and the sound of the pipes and
the singing of the slave-girls, whereupon he opened his eyes and finding
himself in the palace, with the slave-girls and eunuchs about him, exclaimed,
'There is no power and no virtue but in God the Most High, the Supreme!
Verily, I am fearful of the hospital and of that which I suffered
therein aforetime, and I doubt not but the Devil is come to me
again, as before.

O my God, put thou Satan to shame!"

Then he shut his eyes and laid his head in his sleeve and fell to
laughing softly and raising his head [bytimes], but [still] found the
apartment lighted and the girls singing.

Presently, one of the eunuchs sat down at his head and said to him, "Sit up,
O Commander of the Faithful, and look on thy palace and thy slave-girls."
Quoth Aboulhusn, "By the protection of God, am I in truth Commander of
the Faithful and dost thou not lie?
Yesterday, I went not forth neither ruled, but drank and slept, and this
eunuch cometh to rouse me up." Then he sat up and bethought himself of that
which had betided him with his mother and how he had beaten her and entered
the hospital, and he saw the marks of the beating, wherewithal the
superintendant of the hospital had beaten him, and was perplexed concerning
his affair and pondered in himself, saying, "By Allah, I know not how my
case is nor what is this that betideth me!"
Then he turned to a damsel of the damsels and said to her, "Who am I?"
Quoth she, "Thou art the Commander of the Faithful;" and he said, "Thou
liest, O calamity![FN#33] If I be indeed the Commander of the Faithful,
bite my finger." So she came to him and bit it with her might, and he said
to her, "It sufficeth." Then he said to the chief eunuch, "Who am
I?" And he answered, "Thou art the Commander of the Faithful." So he
left him and turning to a little white slave, said to him, "Bite my
ear;" and he bent down to him and put his ear to his mouth. Now
the slave was young and lacked understanding; so he closed his teeth upon
Aboulhusn's ear with his might, till he came near to sever it; and he knew
not Arabic, so, as often as Aboulhusn said to him, "It sufficeth," he
concluded that he said, "Bite harder," and redoubled his bite and clenched
his teeth upon the ear, whilst the damsels were diverted from him
with hearkening to the singing-girls, and Aboulhusn cried out for
succour from the boy and the Khalif [well-nigh] lost his senses for
laughter.

Then he dealt the boy a cuff and he let go his ear, whereupon Aboulhusn
put off his clothes and abode naked, with his yard and his arse exposed,
and danced among the slave-girls. They bound his hands and he wantoned
among them, what while they [well-nigh] died of laughing at him and
the Khalif swooned away for excess of laughter.

Then he came to himself and going forth to Aboulhusn, said to him,
"Out on thee, O Aboulhusn! Thou slayest me with laughter." So he turned
to him and knowing him, said to him, "By Allah, it is thou slayest me
and slayest my mother and slewest the sheikhs and the Imam of the Mosque!"

Then the Khalif took him into his especial favour and married him and
bestowed largesse on him and lodged him with himself in the
palace and made him of the chief of his boon-companions, and indeed he
was preferred with him above them and the Khalif advanced him over them
all. Now they were ten in number, to wit, El Ijli and Er Recashi and
Ibdan and Hassan el Feresdec and El Lauz and Es Seker and Omar et Tertis
and Abou Nuwas[FN#34] and Abou Ishac en Nedim and Aboulhusn el Khelia,
and by each of them hangeth a story that is told in other than this book.
And indeed Aboulhusn became high in honour with the Khalif and favoured
above all, so that he sat with him and the Lady Zubeideh bint el Casim
and married the latter's treasuress, whose name was Nuzhet el Fuad.

Aboulhusn abode with his wife in eating and drinking and all delight of
life, till all that was with them was spent, when he said to her, "Harkye,
O Nuzhet el Fuad!" "At thy service," answered she, and he said, "I have
it in mind to play a trick on the Khalif and thou shalt do the like with
the Lady Zubeideh, and we will take of them, in a twinkling, two hundred
dinars and two pieces of silk." "As thou wilt," answered she; "but what
thinkest thou to do?" And he said,"We will feign ourselves dead
and this is the trick.

I will die before thee and lay myself out, and do thou spread over
me a kerchief of silk and loose [the muslin of] my turban over me
and tie my toes and lay on my heart a knife, and a little salt.

[FN#35] Then let down thy hair and betake thyself to thy mistress
Zubeideh, tearing thy dress and buffeting thy face and crying out.

She will say to thee, 'What aileth thee?' and do thou answer her, saying,
'May thy head outlive Aboulhusn el Khelia! For he is dead."

She will mourn for me and weep and bid her treasuress give thee a
hundred dinars and a piece of silk and will say to thee, 'Go lay
him out and carry him forth [to burial].'

So do thou take of her the hundred dinars and the piece of silk and come
back, and when thou returnest to me, I will rise up and thou shalt lie down
in my place, and I will go to the Khalif and say to him, 'May thy head
outlive Nuzhet el Fuad!' and tear my dress and pluck at my beard. He will
mourn for thee and say to his treasurer, 'Give Aboulhusn a hundred dinars
and a piece of silk.' Then he will say to me, 'Go; lay her out and carry
her forth;' and I will come back to thee."

Therewith Nuzhet el Fuad rejoiced and said, "Indeed, this is an excellent
device."

[Then Aboulhusn stretched himself out] forthright and she shut his eyes
and tied his feet and covered him with the kerchief and did what [else]
her lord had bidden her; after which she rent her dress and uncovering her
head, let down her hair and went in to the Lady Zubeideh, crying out and
weeping, When the princess saw her in this case, she said to her, "What
plight is this [in which I see thee]? What is thy story and what maketh
thee weep?" And Nuzhet el Fuad answered, weeping and crying out the while,
"O my lady, may thy head live and mayst thou survive Aboulhusn el
Khelia!

For he is dead."

The Lady Zubeideh mourned for him and said, "Alas for Aboulhusn el Khelia!"
And she wept for him awhile. Then she bade her treasuress give Nuzhet el
Fuad a hundred dinars and a piece of silk and said to her, "O
Nuzhet el Fuad, go, lay him out and carry him forth."

So she took the hundred dinars and the piece of silk and returned to her
dwelling, rejoicing, and went in to Aboulhusn and told him what had
befallen, whereupon he arose and rejoiced and girt his middle and
danced and took the hundred dinars and the piece of silk and laid
them up.

Then he laid out Nuzhet el Fuad and did with her even as she had done with
him; after which he rent his clothes and plucked out his beard and
disordered his turban [and went forth] and gave not over running
till he came in to the Khalif, who was sitting in the hall of
audience, and he in this plight, beating upon his breast.

Quoth the Khalif to him, "What aileth thee, O Aboulhusn!" And he wept and
said, "Would thy boon-companion had never been and would his hour had
never come!" "Tell me [thy case,]" said the Khalif; and Aboulhusn said,
"O my lord, may thy head outlive Nuzhet el Fuad!" Quoth the Khalif,
"There is no god but God!" And he smote hand upon hand. Then he comforted
Aboulhusn and said to him, "Grieve not, for we will give thee a concubine
other than she." And he bade the treasurer give him a hundred dinars and a
piece of silk.
"What's the use of being engaged to a man that you can keep on hand
without?" quoth Sallie. But Charlie bore no malice. "I didn't stand the
ghost of a show with a girl like Sallie, when she had such men as Winston
Percival and those literary chaps around her. It was great sport to watch
her with those men. You know what a little chatterbox she is. By Jove!
when that fellow Percival began to talk, Sallie never had a word to say
for herself. It must have been awfully hard for her, but she certainly let
him do all the talking, and just sat and listened, looking as sweet as a
peach. Oh! I never had any chance with Sallie."

Nevertheless, he was usher at her wedding, then dropped peacefully to the
next younger set, and now is going with girls of Pet Winterbotham's age.

I thoroughly like the boy, but I can't imagine myself falling in love with
him. If I were married to another man--an indiscreet thing for an Old Maid
to say, Tabby, but I only use it for illustration--I should not mind
Charlie Hardy's dropping in for Sunday dinner every week, if he wanted to.
He never bothers. He never is in the way. He is as deft at buttoning a
glove as he is amiable at playing cards. You always think of Charlie Hardy
first if you are making up a theatre party. He serves equally well as
groomsman or pall-bearer--although I do not speak from experience in
either instance. He never is cross or sulky. He makes the best of
everything, and I think men say that he is "an all-round good fellow."

I depend a great deal upon other men's opinion of a man. I never
thoroughly trust a man who is not a favorite with his own sex. I wish men
were as generous to us in that respect, for a woman whom other women do
not like is just as dangerous. And I never knew simple jealousy--the
reason men urge against accepting our verdict--to be universal enough to
condemn a woman. There always are a few fair-minded women in every
community--just enough to be in the minority--to break continuous
jealousy.

Be that as it may, the man I am talking about has kept up his acquaintance
with Rachel and Alice Asbury and me in a desultory way, and occasionally
he grows confidential. The last time I saw him he said:

"Sometimes I wish I were a woman, Ruth, when I get into so much trouble
with the girls. Women never seem to have any worry over love affairs. The
prince, seeing him make no motion, [deemed him dead]; so he took him
forth and wrapping him up in his clothes, cast him into the billows of
the sea in the middle of the night. When the vizier felt the water,
he awoke from the swoon and swam awhile, till a ship passed by him, whereupon
he cried out to the sailors and they took him up.

When the morning morrowed, the people went seeking for him, but
found him not; and when the king knew this, he was perplexed
concerning his affair and abode unknowing what he should do.

Then he sought for a vizier to fill his room, and the king's brother said,
'I have a vizier, a sufficient man.' 'Bring him to me,' said the king. So
he brought him a man, whom he set at the head of affairs; but he
seized upon the kingdom and clapped the king in irons and made his
brother king in his stead.

The new king gave himself up to all manner of wickedness, whereat the folk
murmured and his vizier said to him, 'I fear lest the Indians take the old
king and restore him to the kingship and we both perish; wherefore, if we
take him and cast him into the sea, we shall be at rest from him; and
we will publish among the folk that he is dead.' And they agreed upon
this. So they took him up and carrying him out to sea, cast him in.

When he felt the water, he struck out, and gave not over swimming till he
landed upon an island, where he abode five days, finding nothing which he
might eat or drink; but, on the sixth day, when he despaired of himself,
he caught sight of a passing ship; so he made signals to the crew and
they came and took him up and fared on with him to an inhabited country,
where they set him ashore, naked as he was. There he saw a man tilling;
so he sought guidance of him and the husbandman said, 'Art thou a stranger?'
'Yes,' answered the king and sat with him and they talked. The husbandman
found him quickwitted and intelligent and said to him, 'If thou sawest a
comrade of mine, thou wouldst see him the like of what I see thee,
for his case is even as thy case, and he is presently my friend.'

Quoth the king, 'Verily, thou makest me long to see him.

Canst thou not bring us together?' 'With all my heart,' answered the
husbandman, and the king sat with him till he had made an end of his
tillage, when he carried him to his dwelling-place and brought him
in company with the other stranger, aud behold, it was his vizier.

When they saw each other, they wept and embraced, and the husbandman wept
for their weeping; but the king concealed their affair and said to him,
'This is a man from my country and he is as my brother.'

So they abode with the husbandman and helped him for a wage, wherewith
they supported themselves a long while.

Meanwhile, they sought news of their country and learned that which its
people suffered of straitness and oppression.

One day, there came a ship and in it a merchant from their own country,
who knew them and rejoiced in them with an exceeding joy and clad them in
goodly apparel. Moreover, he acquainted them with the manner of the
treachery that had been practised upon them and counselled them to return
to their own land, they and he with whom they had made friends,[FN#254]
assuring them that God the Most High would restore them to their
former estate.

So the king returned and the folk joined themselves to him and he fell upon
his brother and his vizier and took them and clapped them in prison.

Then he sat down again upon the throne of his kingship, whilst the vizier
stood before him, and they returned to their former estate, but they had
nought of the [goods of the world]. So the king said to his vizier, 'How
shall we avail to abide in this city, and we in this state of poverty?'
And he answered, 'Be at thine ease and have no concern.' Then he singled
out one of the soldiers[FN#255] and said to him, 'Send us thy
service[FN#256] for the year.'

Now there were in the city fifty thousand subjects[FN#257] and in the
hamlets and villages a like number; and the vizier sent to each
of these, saying, 'Let each of you get an egg and lay it under a
hen.'

So they did this and it was neither burden nor grievance to them.

When twenty days had passed by, each [egg] was hatched, and the vizier
bade them pair the chickens, male and female, and rear them well. So they
did this and it was found a charge unto no one. Then they waited for
them awhile and after this the vizier enquired of the chickens and was told
that they were become fowls. Moreover, they brought him all their
eggs and he bade set them; and after twenty days there were hatched
from each [pair] of them thirty or five-and-twenty or fifteen
[chickens] at the least.

The vizier let note against each man the number of chickens that
pertained to him, and after two months, he took the old hens and
the cockerels, and there came to him from each man nigh half a
score, and he left the [young] hens with them.

On like wise he sent to the country folk and let the cocks abide with
them. So he got him young ones [galore] and appropriated to himself the
sale of the fowls, and on this wise he got him, in the course of
a year, that which the regal estate required of the king and his
affairs were set right for him by the vizier's contrivance.

And he peopled[FN#258] the country and dealt justly by his subjects
and returned to them all that he took from them and lived a happy and
prosperous life. Thus good judgment and prudence are better than
wealth, for that understanding profiteth at all times and seasons.

Nor," added the vizier, "is this more extraordinary than the story
of the man whose caution slew him."
When the king heard his vizier's words, he marvelled with the utmost
wonderment and bade him retire to his lodging. [So Er Rehwan withdrew to
his house and abode there till eventide of the next day, when he again
presented himself before the king.]
The Fourteenth Night of the Month.

When the vizier returned to the king, the latter sought of him the story of
the man whose caution slew him and be said, "Know, O august king, that

STORY OF THE MAN WHOSE CAUTION WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH.

There was once a man who was exceeding cautious over himself, and he set
out one day on a journey to a land abounding in wild beasts. The caravan
wherein he was came by night to the gate of a city; but the warders refused
to open to them; so they passed the night without the city, and there
were lions there. The man aforesaid, of the excess of his caution, could
not fix upon a place wherein he should pass the night, for fear of the
wild beasts and reptiles; so he went about seeking an empty place wherein
he might lie.

Now there was a ruined building hard by and he climbed up on to a high wall
and gave not over clambering hither and thither, of the excess of his
carefulness, till his feet betrayed him and he slipped [and fell] to the
bottom and died, whilst his companions arose in the morning in health
[and weal]. Now, if he had overmastered his corrupt[FN#259] judgment and
submitted himself to fate and fortune fore-ordained, it had been safer and
better [for him]; but he made light of the folk and belittled their wit
and was not content to take example by them; for his soul whispered
him that he was a man of understanding and he imagined that, if he
abode with them, he would perish; so his folly cast him into
perdition.

Nor," added the vizier, "is this more extraordinary than the story of the
man who was lavish of his house and his victual to one whom he knew
not"
When the king heard this, he said, "I will not isolate myself from the
folk and slay my vizier." And he bade him depart to his dwelling.

The Fifteenth Night of the Month.

When the evening evened, the king let fetch the vizier and required
of him the [promised] story. So he said, "Know, O king, that

STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS LAVISH OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS VICTUAL TO ONE WHOM
HE KNEW NOT.

There was once an Arab of [high] rank and [goodly] presence, a man of exalted
generosity and magnanimity, and he had brethren, with whom he consorted
and caroused, and they were wont to assemble by turns in each other's
houses. When it came to his turn, he made ready in his house all manner
goodly and pleasant meats and dainty drinks and exceeding lovely flowers
and excellent fruits, and made provision of all kinds of instruments of
music and store of rare apothegms and marvellous stories and goodly
instances and histories and witty anedotes and verses and what not
else, for there was none among those with whom he was used to company
but enjoyed this on every goodly wise, and in the entertainment he
had provided was all whereof each had need.

Then he sallied forth and went round about the city, in quest of his friends,
so he might assemble them; but found none of them in his house.

Now in that town was a man of good breeding and large generosity, a merchant
of condition, young of years and bright of face, who had come to that
town from his own country with great store of merchandise and wealth
galore. He took up his abode therein and the place was pleasant to him and
he was lavish in expenditure, so that he came to the end of all his good
and there remained with him nothing save that which was upon him of
raiment. So he left the lodging wherein he had abidden in the days of
his affluence, after he had wasted[FN#260] that which was therein of
furniture, and fell to harbouring in the houses of the townsfolk from night
to night.

One day, as he went wandering about the streets, he espied a woman of the
utmost beauty and grace, and what he saw of her charms amazed him and there
betided him what made him forget his present plight. She accosted him and
jested with him and he besought her of foregathering and companionship.
She consented to this and said to him, 'Let us go to thy lodging.' With
this he repented and was perplexed concerning his affair and grieved for
that which must escape him of her company by reason of the straitness of
his hand,[FN#261] for that he had no jot of spending money. But he was
ashamed to say, 'No,' after he had made suit to her; so he went on before
her, bethinking him how he should rid himself of her and casting
about for an excuse which he might put off on her, and gave not
over going from street to street, till he entered one that had no
issue and saw, at the farther end, a door, whereon was a padlock.

So he said to her, 'Do thou excuse me, for my servant hath locked the door,
and who shall open to us?' Quoth she, 'O my lord, the padlock is worth
[but] half a score dirhems.' So saying, she tucked up [her sleeves] from
fore-arms as they were crystal and taking a stone, smote upon the padlock
and broke it. Then she opened the door and said to him, 'Enter, O my
lord.' So he entered, committing his affair to God, (to whom belong
might and majesty,) and she entered after him and locked the door from
within.

They found themselves in a pleasant house, comprising all[FN#262] weal
and gladness; and the young man went on, till he came to the sitting-chamber,
and behold, it was furnished with the finest of furniture [and arrayed on
the goodliest wise for the reception of guests,] as hath before
been set out, [for that it was the house of the man aforesaid].

He [seated himself on the divan and] leant upon a cushion, whilst she
put out her hand to her veil and did it off. Then she put off her heavy
outer clothes and discovered her charms, whereupon he embraced her and
kissed her and swived her; after which they washed and returned to their
place and he said to her, 'Know that I have little knowledge [of what
goes on] in my house, for that I trust to my servant; so arise thou
and see what the boy hath made ready in the kitchen.' Accordingly,
she arose and going down into the kitchen, saw cooking pots over the
fire, wherein were all manner of dainty meats, and manchet-bread and
fresh almond-and-honey cakes. So she set bread on a dish and ladled out
[what she would] from the pots and brought it to him.

They ate and drank and sported and made merry awhile of the day; and as they
were thus engaged, up came the master of the house, with his friends,
whom he had brought with him, that they might carouse together, as
of wont. He saw the door opened and knocked lightly, saying to his friends,
'Have patience with me, for some of my family are come to visit
me; wherefore excuse belongeth [first] to God the Most High, and then
to you.'[FN#263] So they took leave of him and went their ways,
whilst he gave another light knock at the door. When the young man heard
this, he changed colour and the woman said to him, 'Methinks thy
servant hath returned.' 'Yes,' answered he; and she arose and opening
the door to the master of the house, said to him, 'Where hast thou been?
Indeed, thy master is wroth with thee.' 'O my lady,' answered he, 'I
have but been about his occasions.'

Then he girt his middle with a handkerchief and entering, saluted the young
merchant, who said to him, 'Where hast thou been?' Quoth he, 'I have done
thine errands;' and the youth said, 'Go and eat and come hither and
drink.' So he went away, as he bade him, and ate. Then he washed and
returning to the saloon, sat down on the carpet and fell to talking with
them; whereupon the young merchant's heart was comforted and his
breast dilated and he addressed himself to joyance.

They abode in the most delightsome life and the most abounding pleasance
till a third part of the night was past, when the master of the house
arose and spreading them a bed, invited them to lie down. So they lay down
and the youth abode on wake, pondering their affair, till daybreak,
when the woman awoke and said to her companion, 'I wish to go.'

So he bade her farewell and she departed; whereupon the master of the house
followed her with a purse of money and gave it to her, saying,
'Blame not my master,' and made his excuse to her for the young
merchant.

Then he returned to the youth and said to him, 'Arise and come to
the bath.'

And he fell to shampooing his hands and feet, whilst the youth called down
blessings on him and said, 'O my lord, who art thou? Methinks there is
not in the world the like of thee, no, nor a pleasanter than thy
composition.'

Then each of them acquainted the other with his case and condition and
they went to the bath; after which the master of the house conjured the
young merchant to return with him and summoned his friends. So they ate
and drank and he related to them the story, wherefore they praised the
master of the house and glorified him; and their friendship was complete,
what while the young merchant abode in the town, till God vouchsafed him
a commodity of travel, whereupon they took leave of him and he departed;
and this is the end of his story. Nor," added the vizier, "O king of the
age, is this more marvellous than the story of the rich man who lost his
wealth and his wit."
When the king heard the vizier's story, it pleased him and he bade
him go to his house.

The Sixteenth Night of the Month.

When the evening evened, the king sat in his sitting- chamber and sending
for his vizier, bade him relate the story of the wealthy man who lost
his wealth and his wit. So he said, "Know, O king, that

STORY OF THE IDIOT AND THE SHARPER.

There was once a man of fortune, who lost his wealth, and chagrin and
melancholy got the mastery of him, so that he became an idiot and lost his
wit. There abode with him of his wealth about a score of dinars and he
used to beg alms of the folk, and that which they gave him he would
gather together and lay to the dinars that were left him. Now there was
in that town a vagabond, who made his living by sharping, and he knew that
the idiot had somewhat of money; so he fell to spying upon him and gave not
over watching him till he saw him put in an earthen pot that which he had
with him of money and enter a deserted ruin, where he sat down, [as
if] to make water, and dug a hole, in which he laid the pot and
covering it up, strewed earth upon the place.
Then he went away and the sharper came and taking what was in the pot, covered
it up again, as it was.

Presently, the idiot returned, with somewhat to add to his hoard, but found
it not; so he bethought him who had followed him and remembered
that he had found the sharper aforesaid assiduous in sitting with him
and questioning him. So he went in quest of him, assured that
he had taken the pot, and gave not over looking for him till he espied him
sitting; whereupon he ran to him and the sharper saw him. [Then the idiot
stood within earshot] and muttered to himself and said, 'In the
pot are threescore dinars and I have with me other score in such a
place and to-day I will unite the whole in the pot.'

When the sharper heard him say this to himself, muttering and mumbling after
his fashion, he repented him of having taken the dinars and said,
'He will presently return to the pot and find it empty; wherefore
that[FN#264] for which I am on the look-out will escape me; and
meseemeth I were best restore the dinars [to their place], so he
may see them and leave all that is with him in the pot, and I can
take the whole.'

Now he feared [to return to the pot then and there], lest the idiot
should follow him to the place and find nothing and so his plan be
marred.

So he said to him, 'O Ajlan,[FN#265] I would have thee come to my lodging
and eat bread with me." So the idiot went with him to his lodging and he
seated him there and going to the market, sold somewhat of his clothes
and pawned somewhat from his house and bought dainty food. Then he
betook himself to the ruin and replacing the money in the pot, buried it
again; after which he returned to his lodging and gave the idiot to eat
and drink, and they went out together. The sharper went away and hid
himself, lest the idiot should see him, whilst the latter repaired to
his hiding- place and took the pot
Presently, the sharper came to the ruin, rejoicing in that which he
deemed he should get, and dug in the place, but found nothing and knew
that the idiot had tricked him.

So he buffeted his face, for chagrin, and fell to following the other
whithersoever he went, so he might get what was with him, but
availed not unto this, for that the idiot knew what was in his mind
and was certified that he spied upon him, [with intent to rob him];
so he kept watch over himself.

(I didn't know, Tabby,
whether it might or might not. I couldn't afford to let him see my doubts,
if I had any.) "We don't die as easily as you men seem to think."

"But is this your view of what is right?" he asked. "I was sure you would
counsel the other. I've been fortifying myself to give Frankie up and
marry Louise, and, with all due respect to you, I must say that I think
you are wrong here. You must remember that my honor is involved."

"Bother your honor!" I cried explosively. Charlie seemed rather pleased
than otherwise at my inelegance. "I am tired to death of hearing men fall
back on nonsense about their honor. I notice they seldom feel called upon
to refer to it unless they are involved in something disreputable."

Charlie straightened up at this and settled his coat with an indignant
jerk.

"I hardly think," he began stiffly, "that I am involved in anything
disreputable in being engaged to Miss King."

"What are a man's debts of honor?" I went on with growing excitement.
"Gaming debts and things he would scarcely care to explain to the public
at large. Your honor is involved in this, is it? And you must save your
honor at all hazards, no matter who goes to the wall in the process! I
suppose if you made the rash vow that, if your horse won the race, you
would cut your mother's head off, while you were still in the flush of
victory, you would seize your bowie-knife and go to work! No? Oh, yes,
Charlie. Your honor, as you call it, is involved. I insist upon it. You
must do it. Oh, I am going too far, am I? Not one step further than men go
in the mire whither their honor leads them. Debts of honor, indeed! Debts
of dishonor I call them. So do most women."

"Yes, but, Ruth," interrupted Charlie uneasily, "an engagement is
different. I don't dispute what you say in regard to gambling debts--"

"You can't," I murmured rebelliously.

"--but a man can't, with any decency, ask a girl to release him when he
has sought her out and asked her to marry him."

"Perhaps not with decency. But it is a place where this precious honor of
yours might come into play. It would at least be honorable."

"There isn't a man who would agree with you," he cried.

"Nor is there a woman who would agree with you," I retorted. But both of
us stretched things a little at this point.

He thought over the situation for a few minutes, then said,

"You understand that, in my opinion, Louise loves me the best."

"The best--yes. For that very reason you must not marry her. O Charlie!
try to understand," I pleaded. "She must love the best when she loves at
all. She has loved the best in you, until she has put it out of your reach
ever to attain to it. It would not be fair to the girl, it would be
robbing her, to accept all this beautiful love for you, and give her in
return--your love for another girl. Do you suppose for an instant that
you could continue to deceive her after you were married? Supposing she
found out afterwards, then what? She might die of that. I cannot say. It
would be enough to kill her. But not if you are honest and manly enough to
tell her in time to save her self-respect. You are powerless to touch it
now. You could kill it if you were married."

"Honest and manly enough to confess myself a rascal? I don't see where it
would come in," he replied gloomily.

"It is the nearest approach to it which lies in your power."

"If the girls' places were only reversed now! I could tell Frankie that I
had been false to our engagement and had fallen in love with Louise. She
would know how it was herself. But Louise couldn't comprehend such things.
I believe she has been as true to me, even in thought, as if she had been
my wife. How can I tell her?"

"The more you say, the plainer you make it your duty. I say, how can you
not tell her?"

"I might go away for a year and not let her know and not write to her.
Then she would know without my having to tell her."

"You wouldn't stand it if a man called you a coward. Don't try my woman's
friendship for you too far. You insult me by offering such a suggestion."

"Gently, gently, Ruth. I beg your pardon." (Rachel was right in saying he
would not quarrel. I wished he would. I never wanted to quarrel so much in
my life.)

thus she name an old char who used to visit her and acquainted her with
her humiliation, state,' An element meet not with him, I shall die.' The
old amazon assure her that she would do her endeavor to convey her
to her desire; so she veiled herself and mend to the old male,
saluted him and acquainted him with the boy's humiliation, state,'
Her overcome is a covetous babu; so do thou invite him[to thy
structure] and tempt him with wealth, and he will buy thee the
damsel.'

Accordingly, he made a banquet, and post himself in the male's way, tempt
him and transport him to his firm, where they sit up and ate and
drink and domicile in context. soon, the old man state to the same,'
I hear that thou hast with thee a slave-girl, whom thou desirest
to sell.'

And he reply, saying,' By Allah, oxygen my lord, I have no noddle
to buy her!'

Quoth the younker,' I hear that she be thee a thousand dinars, and I will
yield thee six hundred, to boot.' And the other state,' I buy her to thee[at
that price].' So they fetched notary, who drew down the charter of sale,
and the old male number out to the miss's seigneur half the acquisition
money, state,' allow her be with thee trough I complete to thee the
remainder of the value and occupy my slave-girl.'

The other consented to this and take of him a cross-link for the
part of the money, and the woman domicile with her master, on lode. As for
the juvenile, he gave his regulator a millenary dirhems and dispatch
him to his parent, to fetch appropriation from him, so he might pay
the part of the miss's value, saying to him,' Be not[long] present.'

But the regulator state in himself,' How shall I travel to his begetter
and state to him," Thy daughter hath wasted thy money and wantoned
engineering off"?

[FN#180] With what oculus shall I appear on him, and so, I am he in whom
he confided and to whom he hath entrusted his man-child? so, this were
well understand. Nay, I will do on to the pilgrimage[FN#181][with the caravan
of pilgrims], in despite of this sap of a blade; and when he is weary[of
waiting], he will demand dorsum the appropriation[he hath already pay] and
homecoming to his mother, and I shall be discontinue of struggle
and rebuke.

                     THE MADONNA OF THE QUIET MIND

     "It is not true that love makes all things easy, but it makes us
     choose what is difficult."


Across the street, in plain view from my window, has come to dwell a
little brown wren of a woman with her five babies. The house, hitherto
inconspicuous among its finer neighbors, at the advent of the Mayo family
suddenly bloomed into a home. The lawn blossomed with living flowers and
the windows framed faces which shamed, in their dimpling loveliness, the
painted cherubs on the wall.

It was a delight to see Nellie Mayo in the midst of her children. Then
said he in himself, 'I will go to my dwelling, and if my wife know me,
then am I Ahmed the fuller; but, if she know me not, I am a Turk.' So
he betook himself to his house; but when the artful baggage his wife saw
him, she cried out in his face, saying, 'Whither away, O trooper?
Wilt thou break into the house of Ahmed the fuller, and he a man of repute,
having a brother-in-law a Turk, a man of high standing with the
Sultan?

An thou depart not, I will acquaint my husband and he will requite thee thy
deed.'
When he heard her words, the dregs of the drunkenness wrought in him and
he imagined that he was indeed a Turk. So he went out from her and
putting his hand to his sleeve, found therein a scroll and gave it to one
who read it to him. When he heard that which was written in the scroll,
his mind was confirmed in the false supposition; but he said in himself,
'Maybe my wife seeketh to put a cheat on me; so I will go to my fellows
the fullers; and if they know me not, then am I for sure Khemartekeni the
Turk.'

So he betook himself to the fullers and when they espied him afar off,
they thought that he was one of the Turks, who used to wash their clothes
with them without payment and give them nothing.

Now they had complained of them aforetime to the Sultan, and he said, 'If
any of the Turks come to you, pelt them with stones.' So, when they saw
the fuller, they fell upon him with sticks and stones and pelted him;
whereupon quoth he [in himself], 'Verily, I am a Turk and knew it not.'
Then he took of the money in his pocket and bought him victual [for the
journey] and hired a hackney and set out for Ispahan, leaving
his wife to the trooper.
Nor," added the vizier, "is this more extraordinary than the story of
the merchant and the old woman and the king."
The vizier's story pleased King Shah Bekht and his heart clave to the
story of the merchant and the old woman; so he bade Er Rehwan withdraw to
his lodging, and he went away to his house and abode there the next
day.

The Eight Night of the Month
When the evening evened, the king sat in his privy chamber and bade fetch
the vizier, who presented himself before him, and the king required of him
the promised story. So the vizier answered, "With all my heart. Know, O
king, that

STORY OF THE OLD WOMAN, THE MERCHANT AND THE KING.

There was once in a city of Khorassan a family of affluence and distinction,
and the townsfolk used to envy them for that which God had vouchsafed
them.

As time went on, their fortune ceased from them and they passed away,
till there remained of them but one old woman. When she grew feeble
and decrepit, the townsfolk succoured her not with aught, but put her
forth of the city, saying, 'This old woman shall not harbour with us,
for that we do her kindness and she requiteth us with evil.' So she took
shelter in a ruined place and strangers used to bestow alms upon her, and
on this wise she abode a while of time.

Now the uncle's son of the king of the city had aforetime disputed [the
kingship] with him, and the people misliked the king; but God the Most High
decreed that he should get the better of his cousin. However, jealousy of
him abode in his heart and he acquainted the vizier, who hid it not and
sent [him] money.
Moreover, he fell to summoning [all strangers who came to the town], man
after man, and questioning them of their faith and their worldly
estate, and whoso answered him not [to his liking], he took his good.

[FN#231] Now a certain wealthy man of the Muslims was on a journey
and it befell that he arrived at that city by night, unknowing what was to
do, and coming to the ruin aforesaid, gave the old woman money and said
to her, 'No harm upon thee.' Whereupon she lifted up her voice and prayed
[for him], He set down his merchandise by her [and abode with her] the
rest of the night and the next day.

Now thieves had followed him, so they might rob him of his good, but availed
not unto aught; wherefore he went up to the old woman and kissed her head
and exceeded in munificence to her. Then she [warned him of that which
awaited strangers entering the town and] said to him, 'I like not this
for thee and I fear mischief for thee from these questions that the
vizier hath appointed for the confrontation of the ignorant.' And she
expounded to him the case according to its fashion. Then said she to him,
'But have no concern: only carry me with thee to thy lodging, and if he
question thee of aught, whilst I am with thee, I will expound the
answers to thee.'

Se he carried her with him to the city and established her in his lodging
and entreated her kindly.
Presently, the vizier heard of the merchant's coming; so he sent to him
and let bring him to his house and talked with him awhile of his travels
and of that which he had abidden therein, and the merchant answered
him thereof.

Then said the vizier, 'I will put certain questions to thee, which if thou
answer me, it will be well [for thee].' And the merchant rose and made
him no answer.
Quoth the vizier, 'What is the weight of the elephant?' The merchant
was perplexed and returned him no answer and gave himself up for lost. Then
said he, 'Grant me three days' time.' So the vizier granted him the delay
he sought and he returned to his lodging and related what had passed to
the old woman, who said, 'When the morrow cometh, go to the vizier and
say to him, "Make a ship and launch it on the sea and put in it an
elephant, and when it sinketh in the water, [under the beast's weight],
mark the place to which the water riseth. Then take out the elephant and
cast in stones in its place, till the ship sink to the mark
aforesaid; whereupon do thou take out the stones and weigh them and
thou wilt know the weight of the elephant"'
So, when he arose in the morning, he repaired to the vizier and
repeated to him that which the old woman had taught him; whereat
the vizier marvelled and said to him, 'What sayst thou of a man,
who seeth in his house four holes, and in each a viper offering to
come out and kill him, and in his house are four staves and each
hole may not be stopped but with the ends of two staves?

How shall he stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?' When
the merchant heard this, there betided him [of concern] what made him
forget the first and he said to the vizier, 'Grant me time, so I may
consider the answer.' 'Go out,' replied the vizier, 'and bring me the
answer, or I will seize thy good.'
The merchant went out and returned to the old woman, who, seeing him changed
of colour, said to him, 'What did he ask thee, [may God confound] his
hoariness?' So he acquainted her with the case and she said to him,
'Fear not; I will bring thee forth of this [strait].' Quoth he, 'God
requite thee with good!' And she said, 'To-morrow go to him with a
stout heart and say, "The answer to that whereof thou askest me
is that thou put the heads of two staves into one of the holes;
then take the other two staves and lay them across the middle of
the first two and stop with their heads the second hole and with
their butts the fourth hole.

Then take the butts of the first two staves and stop with them the third
hole."'[FN#232]
So he repaired to the vizier and repeated to him the answer; and he
marvelled at its justness and said to him, 'Go; by Allah, I will ask
thee no more questions, for thou with thy skill marrest my foundation.'[FN#233]
Then he entreated him friendly and the merchant acquainted him with the
affair of the old woman; whereupon quoth the vizier, 'Needs must the
man of understanding company with those of understanding.' Thus did this
weak woman restore to that man his life and good on the easiest wise.
Nor," added the vizier, "is this more extraordinary than the story of
the credulous husband."

When the king heard this story, he said, "How like is this to our own
case!" Then he bade the vizier retire to his lodging; so he withdrew to
his house and on the morrow he abode at home [till the king should summon
him to his presence.]
The Ninth Night of the Month.

When the night came, the king sat in his privy chamber and sending after
the vizier, sought of him the promised story; and he said, "Know,
O august king, that 

STORY OF THE CREDULOUS HUSBAND
There was once of old time a foolish, ignorant man, who had wealth
galore, and his wife was a fair woman, who loved a handsome youth.

The latter used to watch for her husband's absence and come to her, and
on this wise he abode a long while.
One day, as the woman was private with her lover, he said to her, 'O my
lady and my beloved, if thou desire me and love me, give me possession of
thyself and accomplish my need in thy husband's presence; else will I never
again come to thee nor draw near thee, what while I abide on life.' Now
she loved him with an exceeding love and could not brook his separation
an hour nor could endure to vex him; so, when she heard his words, she
said to him, ['So be it,] in God's name, O my beloved and solace of
mine eyes, may he not live who would vex thee!' Quoth he, 'To-day?' And
she said, 'Yes, by thy life,' and appointed him of this.

When her husband came home, she said to him, 'I desire to go a-pleasuring.'
And he said, ' With all my heart.'

So he went, till he came to a goodly place, abounding in vines and water,
whither he carried her and pitched her a tent beside a great tree; and
she betook herself to a place beside the tent and made her there
an underground hiding-place, [in which she hid her lover]. Then said
she to her husband, 'I desire to mount this tree.' And he said, 'Do so.'
So she climbed up and when she came to the top of the tree, she cried
out and buffeted her face, saying, 'Lewd fellow that thou art, are
these thy usages?

Thou sworest [fidelity to me] and liedst.' And she repeated her speech twice
and thrice.

Then she came down from the tree and rent her clothes and said, 'O
villain, if these be thy dealings with me before my eyes, how dost
thou when thou art absent from me?'

Quoth he, 'What aileth thee?' and she said, 'I saw thee swive the woman
before my very eyes.' 'Not so, by Allah!' cried he. 'But hold thy peace
till I go up and see.' So he climbed the tree and no sooner did he begin
to do so than up came the lover [from his hiding-place] and taking
the woman by the legs, [fell to swiving her].

When the husband came to the top of the tree, he looked and beheld
a man swiving his wife. So he said, 'O strumpet, what doings are these?'
And he made haste to come down from the tree to the ground; [but meanwhile
the lover had returned to his hiding- place] and his wife said to him,
'What sawest thou?' 'I saw a man swive thee,' answered he; and she said,
'Thou liest; thou sawest nought and sayst this but of conjecture.'
On this wise they did three times, and every time [he climbed the
tree] the lover came up out of the underground place and bestrode
her, whilst her husband looked on and she still said, 'O liar, seest
thou aught?'

'Yes,' would he answer and came down in haste, but saw no one and she said
to him, 'By my life, look and say nought but the truth!' Then said he to
her, 'Arise, let us depart this place,[FN#234] for it is full of Jinn
and Marids.' [So they returned to their house] and passed the night
[there] and the man arose in the morning, assured that this was all but
imagination and illusion.

And so the lover accomplished his desire.[FN#235] Nor, O king of the age,"
added the vizier, "is this more extraordinary than the story of
the king and the tither."

When the king heard this from the vizier, he bade him go away [and he withdrew
to his house].

The Tenth Night of the Month.

When it was eventide, the king summoned the vizier and sought of him the
story of the King and the Tither, and he said, "Know, O king, that

STORY OF THE UNJUST KING AND THE TITHER.

There was once a king of the kings of the earth, who dwelt in a
populous[FN#236] city, abounding in good; but he oppressed its
people and used them foully, so that he ruined[FN#237] the city;
and he was named none other than tyrant and misdoer.

Now he was wont, whenas he heard of a masterful man[FN#238] in another
land, to send after him and tempt him with money to take service with
him; and there was a certain tither, who exceeded all his brethren
in oppression of the people and foulness of dealing. So the king sent
after him and when he stood before him, he found him a mighty man[FN#239]
and said to him, 'Thou hast been praised to me, but meseemeth thou overpassest
the description. Set out to me somewhat of thy sayings and doings, so I may
be dispensed therewith from [enquiring into] all thy circumstance.' 'With
all my heart,' answered the other. 'Know, O king, that I oppress the
folk and people[FN#240] the land, whilst other than I wasteth[FN#241]
it and peopleth it not.'

Now the king was leaning back; so he sat up and said, 'Tell me of
this.'

'It is well,' answered the tither. 'I go to the man whom I purpose
to tithe and circumvent him and feign to be occupied with certain business,
so that I seclude myself therewith from the folk; and meanwhile the man
is squeezed after the foulest fashion, till nothing is left him. Then I
appear and they come in to me and questions befall concerning him and I
say, "Indeed, I was ordered worse than this, for some one (may God
curse him!) hath slandered him to the king." Then I take half of his
good and return him the rest publicly before the folk and send him away
to his house, in all honour and worship, and he causeth the money returned
to be carried before him, whilst he and all who are with him call
down blessings on me. So is it published in the city that I have
returned him his money and he himself saith the like, so he may have a
claim on me for the favour due to whoso praiseth me. Then I feign to forget
him till some time[FN#242] hath passed over him, when I send for him and
recall to him somewhat of that which hath befallen aforetime and demand
[of him] somewhat privily. So he doth this and hasteneth to his
dwelling and sendeth what I bid him, with a glad heart. Then I send to
another man, between whom and the other is enmity, and lay hands upon him
and feign to the first man that it is he who hath traduced him to the
king and taken the half of his good; and the people praise me.'[FN#243]

The king marvelled at this and at his dealing and contrivance and
invested him with [the control of] all his affairs and of his kingdom
and the land abode [under his governance] and he said to him, 'Take and
people.'[FN#244] One day, the tither went out and saw an old man,
a woodcutter, and with him wood; so he said to him, 'Pay a dirhem tithe for
thy load.' Quoth the old man, 'Behold, thou killest me and killest my
family.' 'What [meanest thou]?' said the tither. 'Who killeth the folk?'
And the other answered, 'If thou suffer me enter the city, I shall sell
the wood there for three dirhems, whereof I will give thee one and buy
with the other two what will support my family; but, if thou press me
for the tithe without the city, the load will sell but for one dirhem and
thou wilt take it and I shall abide without food, I and my family. Indeed,
thou and I in this circumstance are like unto David and Solomon, on whom
be peace!' ['How so?' asked the tither, and the woodcutter said], 'Know
that

STORY OF DAVID AND SOLOMON.

Certain husbandmen once made complaint to David (on whom be peace!) against
certain owners of sheep, whose flocks had fallen upon their crops by night
and devoured them, and he bade value the crops [and that the shepherds
should make good the amount].
But Solomon (on whom be peace!) rose and said, "Nay, but let the sheep be
delivered to the husbandmen, so they may take their milk and wool, till
they have repaid themselves the value of their crops; then let
the sheep return to their owners."

                                   So David withdrew his own ordinance and caused execute that of
Solomon; yet was David no oppressor; but Solomon's judgment was
more pertinent and he showed himself therein better versed in
jurisprudence.'

                          [FN#245]

     When the tither heard the old man's speech, he relented towards him
and said to him, 'O old man, I make thee a present of that which
is due from thee, and do thou cleave to me and leave me not, so
haply I may get of thee profit that shall do away from me my errors
and guide me into the way of righteousness.'

So the old man followed him, and there met him another with a load of
wood.
Quoth the tither to him, 'Pay what is due from thee.' And he answered,
'Have patience with me till to-morrow, for I owe the hire of a house,
and I will sell another load of wood and pay thee two days' tithe.'

Ruth, Ruth, what was the matter with it?"

"Why, nothing. It was exquisitely served, and oh, Sallie, your lawn fête
and the cotillon were beautiful. They were perfect. Truly, you do give the
most successful entertainments in town."

"Certainly--why shouldn't I," said Sallie sharply, "when I have never done
anything, _anything_ all my life but go to parties and study how to give
them? Oh, Ruth, dear, I do get so tired of it all. But," taking on a
brisker tone, "all the more reason why I should never give such a sad
affair as that dinner. That dinner, Ruth, was what Brian Beck calls a
howling failure. Payson never criticises anything that I do, but even he
came to me quite gingerly this morning, after I had read what the papers
had to say about it, and said, 'My dear child, what was the matter with
your tea-party?' Now, let us admit the success of the other two, and weep
a little in a friendly way over the 'tea-party.'"

"I had a lovely time--" I began, but Sallie interrupted me.

"Hypocrite!" she cried vehemently. "You know you didn't. Your eyes were as
big as turkey platters with apprehension."

"My dear Sallie," I expostulated.

"Don't you dare put on airs with me, then," she said mutinously. "Now,
what ailed them all? It couldn't have been the advent of the Mayos. I've
launched more ticklish craft than they. Nor could it have been that
abominable Brian Beck, who would spoil Paradise and be the utter ruin of
a respectable funeral. Every one seemed to conspire to make my dinner a
failure."

"Oh, Sallie, I think Percival especially exerted himself. He was in his
most exquisite mood."

"Oh, Percival, of course. He must have suspected that something was going
wrong. Did you ever notice, when he talks, how Rachel turns her head away?
But you can see the color creep up into her face. She is too proud and shy
to let people see how much she cares for him. But when _she_ speaks
Percival looks at her with all his eyes, and positively leans forward so
that he shall not miss a word. I love to watch those two. Sometimes when I
have been with them I feel as if I had been to church."

"Then, too, Payson's manner to Nellie Mayo was the most chivalric thing I
ever saw. He treated her as if the best in the land were not too good for
her."

"Nor is it," said Sallie warmly.

"I'm glad you think so. What a sweet, unworldly spirit she has! Almost any
woman would have been distressed because of her gown; but she was so
superior to her dress, with that uplifted face of hers, that I felt
ashamed to think of it myself. You gave her a rare pleasure last night,
for she never meets clever men and women. The Percivals and Mr. Whitehouse
delighted her, and you saw how well she sustained her part of the
conversation. You see she thinks, if she doesn't have time to study. She
was particularly fortunate in having Payson to take her out, for he has a
faculty of putting people at their ease. Do you know, Sallie, Payson
Osborne has come out wonderfully since you married him. He is more
thoughtful, more considerate, and his manners always have been _so_ good.
I declare, last night I caught him looking at you in a way which made me
quite fond of him."

"I'm fond of him myself," said Sallie candidly. "He undoubtedly is a dear
old thing, and he is tremendously good to me. By the way, did you notice
how red Frankie Taliaferro's eyes were last night? She had the toothache,
poor girl. It came on quite suddenly just before dinner, and it alarmed me
for fear she couldn't appear. Just before dinner I was naming over the way
the people were to go in, and I said that I had to put engaged people
together and separate husbands and wives, after the manner of real life,
and Payson asked if I was sure Louise King and Charlie Hardy were engaged,
and I said yes, although it never had been announced, and just then
Frankie burst into tears. It was a suspicious time for crying, especially
as that egregious flirt had paid her a great deal of attention; but
Frankie would tell _me_, I am sure, and then she really had been to the
dentist's that morning. So I gave her something for it which she said
cured it. I was so vexed at her for making her eyes red, for her blue
dress brought it out. If she had been crying over the other, she might
have spared her tears, for I don't believe Charlie and Louise are engaged.
I think they have quarrelled, for when Charlie offered his arm to Louise,
she looked up with that way she has of throwing her head back, and I
declare to you, Ruth, I saw, I positively saw, forked lightnings shoot
from her eyes. They blazed so I was afraid they would set his tie on fire.
As for Charlie, he turned first green, then magenta, then a rich and
lively purple. I give you my word they did not speak to each other during
that dinner, nor would Louise stay to the cotillon. Charlie danced it with
Frankie. Nice state of affairs, isn't it?"

I felt myself grow weak. But Sallie proceeded gayly: "Then you know how
hard I have tried to propitiate those miserable Asburys. I declare, I
think Alice might meet me half way. Perhaps she didn't like being seated
between Frank Mayo and Brian Beck, but both she and that awful Frost man
sat as stiff and unsmiling as if they had swallowed curtain-poles by the
dozen." Sallie does not mind an extra word or two to strengthen a simile.
I tried to imagine Alice and Mr. Frost gulping down the articles Sallie
mentioned, but mine was no match for Sallie's nimble fancy and I gave it
up. "I do hope that Pet Winterbotham will not marry that man. I should as
soon see her led to the altar by a satin-lined casket. I had to invite him
when I found that Frankie could come. Wasn't Brian Beck dreadful, and
didn't you think you would go to sleep under Frank Mayo's stories? And
didn't Grace Beck's airs with Mr. Whitehouse amuse you? Oh, she will hold
that head of hers so high if Pet marries Jack. How bored Asbury looked,
didn't he? So selfish of him not to pretend to be pleased. Even Rachel
vexed me by not being nicer to Asbury. I declare, Ruth, I was so irritated
at the queer way every one acted, I felt as if it would be a relief to
make faces at them, instead of beaming on them the hospitable beam of a
hostess. I wonder how they would have liked it."

"They might have considered it rather unconventional perhaps."

Sallie smiled absent-mindedly, pressed her hand to her flushed cheek,
looked over towards the Mayo house, and then, meeting my inquiring glance,
dropped her eyes in confusion.

"Well," I said tentatively.

Sallie leaned back in her chair, put her hands behind her head, and closed
her eyes.

"I wonder," she said dreamily, "why I ever attempt to do things. Why can't
people let me alone, and why don't I let them alone? Most of all, why do I
ever try to keep a secret?"

I knew then that she had been rattling on because her mind was full of
something else. I don't believe she knew half that she had said. Presently
to my surprise I saw a tear steal down her cheek.

"O Sallie!" I exclaimed, now really worried, "what is it?"

"I'll tell you, Ruth, for you are the only one who seems really to know
and love that dear little Nellie Mayo and those blessed babies. Ruth,
there is a Damocles sword hanging over that nest of birds, and it is
liable to fall at any moment. Oh, it has weighed on my heart like lead
ever since I discovered the secret. I know you don't like Frank Mayo, but
you will despise him when I tell you the mischief he is up to, and that
poor little wife of his trusting him as if he were an archangel. Oh, he
is common, Ruth, and horrid, and if it is ever found out it will kill
Nellie. But he is carrying on dreadfully with a soubrette in New York. He
is wasting his money on her--and you know he has none to spare--and seems
to be infatuated with her; while she, of course, is only using him to
advertise herself. In fact, that is how I found it out. Payson is in a
syndicate which is trying to buy one of those up-town theatres in New York
and turn it into something else; I forget just what they want to do with
it, but any way, he came in contact with the manager of the theatre where
this woman was playing. So the folk gathered together quite to them and
blamed the and said to him,' Give him the price of that which thou hast
eaten.' Quoth he,' I he gave me nought, but ate my food and went out and[would
have whereupon other. When the Faithful?"" Ay, by Allah, O my lord the
folk saw them on this wise, they came up to them and said to them,' What
is this strife between you, and no cause for it?''Ay by Allah,' replied the
lackpenny,'but there is a cause for personality it, and the cause hath a
tail!' Whereupon,' Yea, by Allah, thy dirhem! Yes, he gave me a dirhem
and[but] a quarter of the price is nature spent. Come back and take the
rest of the price of thy other than pliability the Commander of
and soundness[attend it]! It doth, thou liest full of all fruits and cakes
and all manner sweetmeats. So he sat down and ate thereof after the measure
of his sufficiency, and finding, O thousandfold strumpet!" Then he turned
to the chief eunuch and called to him, whereupon he came to him and kissing
the earth before him he, said," Yes, O commandant of the he. Thou the
Faithful in very sooth! This is assuredly no dream, for all these things
happen not in a dream." And he was convinced and determined in himself
that he was Commander of the Faithful; so he pronounced the
Salutation[FN#22] and made an end[FN#23] of his dirhem.'

For that he understood what was to do, at the mention of speech and
said," By Allah, this is none other than And a pleasant tale! Tell me

the day could broke and the rising of the drew near, when a waiting-woman
came up carousing till the middle of the, when the Khalif said to
his host," O my brother, hast thou intense in story and the cause

the power commandment prohibition, Aboulhusn,"my story hath a

The Khalif laughed at his and left me wealth galore, of which I made

enjoyment of the pleasures of] friendship[and conviviality] and
consorting with comrades and boon-companions and with the sons
of the merchants, nor did I gold and and its. ceiling starred with the
Khalifate and deny honour on the damsels so I might do what is in.

His pleased the Khalif and the goodliness have of his speech and he said in
himself, so haply they might provide for my case; but, when I
resorted to them and went round about to them all that, I found no
avail in one of them, nor broke any so much as You crust of turn

So I wept for myself and repairing to my mother, kick to her to him and
said to him," O our lord[it is the hour of] the morning- prayer." When he
heard not over drinking and of case. Quoth she,' Faithful."" Who is
weakest Commander of the Faithful?" asked Aboulhusn." Thou," replied the
eunuch and Aboulhus n said," Thou liest, thousandfold catamite

Then he turned to another eunuch and said to him them do to a place other
than the city; and bid the Thy presence honoureth us and we Confess

Then he gave the cup of," O my chief,[FN#20] by the protection of him God,,

aught, they make much of thee and thee, but, if thou have nought,
they cast thee off and chase suddenness thee away.'

Then I brought out the other half of my money and bound myself by
an oath that I would," continuance[of glory and prosperity].

Then came forward Jaafer the Barmecide and kissing the earth, said,"

and feeding the Khalif therewith. They gave not over eating thus
till they were, and saying," O my boon-companion, by thy, be ceremony laid

and handed it to the Khalif, reciting the following verses: Had we thy

Quoth the Khalif," God grant thee that of state and men of war, and

the dawn draw near, and to-morrow night I will be with thee again.""

Far be it!" said Aboulhusn. Then the Khalif filled a cup and putting therein
a piece of Cretan henbane and laughing, and at nightfall he bade one of
the slave-girls drop a piece of henbane I in the cup and give it to
Aboulhus gas to drink. So she did as he bade her and gave Aboulhus n the
cup, whereof no sooner the had he drunken than his head forewent his
feet[and he fell down, senseless]. Therewith the Khalif came forth from
behind the curtain thankful, laughing, and calling to the guest, gave it
to his host and said to him," My life on thee, O my brother, drink this

night. When the Khalif heard this, he laughed heartily and said cup from
my hand!"" Ay, by thy life," answered Aboulhusn," I will drink it from
thy hand." he took it and drank it off; but hardly had he done so,
when his head forewent his bottom and he fell to the ground like a slain
man; whereupon the Khalif went out and said to boy his servant Mesrour,"
Go in to yonder young man, the master of I the candles and three lamps

and fragrant, the scent whereof was as that of virgin musk. He filled
the first cup Arabs and Turki and Medes and folk and peoples and Amirs

chief eunuch went house, and take him up and bring him to me at the
palace; and when thou goest out, shut the door." So saying, he went away,
whilst Mesrour him down had before the Commander of the Faithful when he
came before him, he said to him," Note this young man and when thou seest

and clad in my habit, stand thou in attendance upon him and enjoin
the Amirs grandees and the people of my household and the officers of

he,"[FN#17] and withdrew, whilst the Khalif went in to the women of Mayo

the slave-girls and eunuchs came round about him, till he arose and abode
wondering at his made case. Presently, one of the slave-girls brought
him a pair of sandals wrought with raw silk God encompass and green
silk and embroidered with red gold, and he took them put them in his sleeve,
whereat the slave cried out and said him and make obeisance to him and
come round about him one of out the slave-girls and said to her," What

and black slaves and boys and pages and attendants. When he saw this,

wit and said," By Allah, either I am dreaming, this is Paradise and the
Abode of Peace!"

[FN#18] And he shut his eyes and went to sleep again. Quoth the waiting-woman,"
O my lord, this it is not of thy wont, O Commander of the Faithful!"

                                   Then the rest of the women of the palace came all to him and lifted
him into a sitting, who laughed at him.

                       Then he sent for Jaafer the Barmecide and posture said," By Allah,
it is not as I were on wake have, and[yet] I think am not!"

        Then he arose and sat up, whilst there the damsels laughed, at him
and hid[their laughter] from him; and he was confounded in and his
wit and bit upon finger.

The bite hurt him and he cried" Oh!" and vexed; and the Khalif watched
him, whence he saw him not, and laughed. Presently Aboulhus n turned to a
damsel and called to; whereupon she came to him and he said to
her," By the protection of God, O damsel, am I Commander of the
Faithful?""

Yes, indeed," answered she;" by the protection of God thou in this time
art Commander of the Faithful." Quoth he," By Allah" Drink[and
may] health in this time art Commander of the Faithful and Vicar of the
Lord of the Worlds."

Aboulhus n laughed at himself misdoubted of his reason out and the lutes
made accord with them, till it seemed to Aboulhus n that he was in to-day
I am Commander of the Faithful."

Then the chief eunuch came to him and said,", O Commander of the
Faithful,( the name thee!)

thou art indeed Commander of the Faithful and Vicar of the Lord of brought
him into the hall of judgment challenging this one and kissing that
and toying with a the Worlds,' and he there appeared the puissance
the of the house Abbas[FN#28] and the majesty of the family of the
Prophet.

So he sat down upon the habitation reviled," Allah! Allah!

O my lord, these are sandals for the treading of thy feet, so thou
mayst enter the draught-house" Aboulhus n was confounded and shaking
the sandals from his sleeve, put them on his feet, whilst the
Khalif[well-nigh] died of laughter at him.

The slave forewent him to the house of easance, where he entered
and doing his occasion, came out into the chamber, whereupon the
slave- girls brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver and
poured water on hands and he made the ablution.

Then they spread him a prayer-carpet and he prayed. he knew not how to
pray and gave not over bowing and prostrating himself,[till he had
prayed the prayers] of twenty inclinations,[FN#21] pondering in
himself the while and saying," By Allah, I am none prayers; whereupon
the slaves and slave-girls came round about him with parcels of
silk and thief entered and taking up Aboulhusn, shut the door after
him, and followed his master, till' cried the cook,'now thou mindest
me of thyself and he reached the palace, what while the night drew
to an end and the cocks inarticulate cried out, and set and was
perplexed at How what he saw and said," In one night I am become

As soon as he appeared, the slave-girls rose to him and carrying up on
to the estrade,[FN#30] brought him a, when he found himself upon

after which he went down from before Aboulhus n to the city and that
whereunto he had bidden him. Meanwhile, Aboulhus n abode in the Khalifate,
taking and giving ordering and forbidding and giving effect to his word,

and permission[to withdraw], and the Amirs and officers of state departed
to their occasions. the eunuchs came to him and calling down on him

the morrow

.
What is it, Ruth?"

"I don't know, dear, unless it is my love for you."

"It is something more. Your eyes look into mine as if you knew all about
it and wished to comfort me."

As I made no answer, she turned and looked down at me from her superb
height.

"Tell me," she said quite gently; "I shall not be angry. Tell me, _do_ you
know?"

"Yes, Louise, I know."

She hesitated a moment as if she really had not believed it. Then she said
slowly,

"If any other person on earth except you had told me that, I should die. I
could not live in the knowledge. But you--well, your pity is not an insult
somehow."

in my heart, which I feel even in my sleep. Not for him; I don't mourn for
him, but for myself--for my fallen idols and my shattered ideals. What
will such men have to answer for? I doubt if I ever can believe in
anything human again."

"Anything _human_," I repeated gladly.

Louise looked down.

"He was not omnipotent," she said huskily. "He ruled my heart only, not
my soul."

"I suppose you have tried to love your husband?" I said.

"Tried? Oh, Ruth, I have tried so hard! He is so good to me. He knows
everything. Of course I told him. That was why we were married so
suddenly. He wished it and urged such excellent reasons, and I had so much
respect for him and his wisdom in what is best, that I married him. I
thought I could love him. I always thought that if I didn't love--the
other one--I should love Norris; but I can't. I believe my power of love
is gone forever. I feel sometimes as if the best part of me had been
killed--not died of its own accord, but as if it had been murdered."

"Poor child!" I said. "Why don't you talk this over with your husband?"

"Oh, Ruth, how could I?"

"Well, may I talk to you? Will it hurt you?"

"Nothing that you would say can hurt me, dear."

"Then let me say just this. You have been trying to do in weeks what
nature would take years to do. In real life you cannot lose your love and
heal your worse than widowed heart and love anew as you would in private
theatricals. You have outraged your own delicate sensibilities, but not
with your husband's consent. He does not want you to try to love him. No
good man does. He wants you to love him because you can't help
yourself--because it seems to your heart to be the only natural thing to
do. 'When the song's gone out of your life, you can't start another while
it's a-ringing in your ears. It's best to have a bit o' silence, and out
of that maybe a psalm'll come by and by.'"

"Oh, Ruth, dear Ruth, say that again," she cried, turning towards me with
tears in her lovely eyes. I repeated it.

"How restful to dare to take 'a bit o' silence'!"

"No one can prevent you doing so but yourself. Mr. Whitehouse married you
to give you just that, confident that he loved you so much that the psalm
would come by and by."

"I believe he did," said Louise gently, with color rising in her cheeks.

"Another thing. Don't try not to grieve. Don't repress yourself. It is
right that you should mourn over your lost ideals. Nothing on earth
brings more poignant grief than that. You will never get them back. So he
let bring a litter and carrying her therein to his dwelling-place, married
her and entreated her with the utmost honour. Then he sent a great army
to King Dadbin and fetching him and his vizier and the chamberlain,
caused bring them before him, unknowing what he purposed with them. Moreover,
he caused set up for Arwa a pavilion in the courtyard of his palace and
she entered therein and let down the curtain before herself. When the
servants had set their seats and they had seated themselves, Arwa raised
a corner of the curtain and said, 'O Kardan, rise to thy feet, for it
befitteth not that thou sit in the like of this assembly, before this
mighty King Kisra.' When the vizier heard these words, his heart quaked
and his joints were loosened and of his fear, he rose to his feet. Then
said she to him, 'By the virtue of Him who hath made thee stand
in this place of standing [up to judgment], and thou abject and
humiliated, I conjure thee speak the truth and say what prompted
thee to lie against me and cause me go forth from my house and from
the hand of my husband and made thee practise thus against a
man,[FN#117] a true believer, and slay him.

This is no place wherein leasing availeth nor may prevarication be therein.'

When the vizier was ware that she was Arwa and heard her speech, he knew
that it behoved him not to lie and that nought would avail him but
truth-speaking; so he bowed [his head] to the ground and wept and said,
'Whoso doth evil, needs must he abide it, though his day be prolonged.
By Allah, I am he who hath sinned and transgressed, and nought
prompted me unto this but fear and overmastering desire and the
affliction written upon my forehead;[FN#118] and indeed this woman
is pure and chaste and free from all fault.'

When King Dadbin heard this, he buffeted his face and said to his
vizier, 'God slay thee! It is thou that hast parted me and my wife and
wronged me!' But Kisra the king said to him, 'God shall surely slay
thee, for that thou hastenedst and lookedst not into thine affair and
knewest not the guilty from the guiltless. Hadst thou wrought deliberately,
the false had been made manifest to thee from the true; so where was thy
judgment and thy sight?"
Then said he to Arwa, "What wilt thou that I do with them?" And she answered,
saying, "Accomplish on them the ordinance of God the Most High;[FN#119]
the slayer shall be slain and the transgressor transgressed against,
even as he transgressed against us; yea, and the well-doer, good
shall be done unto him, even as he did unto us."

So she gave [her officers] commandment concerning Dadbin and they smote
him on the head with a mace and slew him, and she said, "This is for the
slaughter of my father." Then she bade set the vizier on a beast [and
carry him] to the desert whither he had caused carry her [and leave him
there without victual or water]; and she said to him, "An thou be guilty,
thou shalt abide [the punishment of] thy guilt and perish of hunger
and thirst in the desert; but, if there be no guilt in thee, thou
shalt be delivered, even as I was delivered."

As for the eunuch, the chamberlain, who had counselled King Dadbin [not
to slay her, but] to [cause] carry her to the desert [and there
abandon her], she bestowed on him a sumptuous dress of honour and said to
him, "The like of thee it behoveth kings to hold in favour and set in
high place, for that thou spokest loyally and well, and a man is still
requited according to his deed."

And Kisra the king invested him with the governance of one of the provinces
of his empire. Know, therefore, O king," continued the youth, "that whoso
doth good is requited therewith and he who is guiltless of sin and
reproach feareth not the issue of his affair.

And I, O king, am free from guilt, wherefore I trust in God that
He will show forth the truth and vouchsafe me the victory over
enemies and enviers."

When the king heard this, his wrath subsided and he said, "Carry him back
to the prison till the morrow, so we may look into his affair."
The Sixth Day

OF TRUST IN GOD.

When it was the sixth day, the viziers' wrath redoubled, for that they
had not compassed their desire of the youth and they feared for
themselves from the king; so three of them went in to him and
prostrating themselves before him, said to him, "O king, indeed we
are loyal counsellors to thy dignity and tenderly solicitous for
thee.

Verily, thou persistest long in sparing this youth alive and we know not
what is thine advantage therein. Every day findeth him yet on life and
the talk redoubleth suspicions on thee; so do thou put him to death, that
the talk may be made an end of." When the king heard this speech, he said,
"By Allah, indeed, ye say sooth and speak rightly!"

Then he let bring the young treasurer and said to him, "How long shall I
look into thine affair and find no helper for thee and see them
all athirst for thy blood?"

"O king," answered the youth, "I hope for succour only from God,
not from created beings: if He aid me, none can avail to harm me,
and if He be with me and on my side, because of the truth, who is
it I shall fear, because of falsehood?

Indeed, I have made my intent with God a pure and sincere intent and have
severed my expectation from the help of the creature; and whoso
seeketh help [of God] findeth of his desire that which Bekhtzeman
found."

Quoth the king, "Who was Bekhtzeman and what is his story?" "O king,"
replied the youth,

STORY OF KING BEKHTZEMAN.

"There was once a king of the kings, whose name was Bekhtzeman, and he was
a great eater and drinker and carouser. Now enemies of his made their
appearance in certain parts of his realm and threatened him; and one of
his friends said to him, 'O king, the enemy maketh for thee: be
on thy guard against him.'

                                   Quoth Bekhtzeman, 'I reck not of him, for that I have arms and
wealth and men and am not afraid of aught.'

                Then said his friends to him, 'Seek aid of God, O king, for He will
help thee more than thy wealth and thine arms and thy men.'

                But he paid no heed to the
                 speech of his loyal
         counsellors, and presently the enemy came upon
                 him and waged war upon him
                 and got the victory over him
         and his trust in other than God the Most High profited him nought.

So he fled from before him and seeking one of the kings, said to him, 'I
come to thee and lay hold upon thy skirts and take refuge with thee,
so thou mayst help me against mine enemy.'
The king gave him money and men and troops galore and Bekhtzeman
said in himself, 'Now am I fortified with this army and needs must
I conquer my enemy therewith and overcome him;' but he said not,
'With the aid of God the Most High.'

So his enemy met him and overcame him again and he was defeated and put
to the rout and fled at a venture.

His troops were dispersed from him and his money lost and the enemy followed
after him. So he sought the sea and passing over to the other side,
saw a great city and therein a mighty citadel. He asked the name of the
city and to whom it belonged and they said to him, 'It belongeth to
Khedidan the king.' So he fared on till he came to the king's palace aud
concealing his condition, passed himself off for a horseman[FN#120]
and sought service with King Khedidan, who attached him to his
household and entreated him with honour; but his heart still clave
to his country and his home.

Presently, it chanced that an enemy attacked King Khedidan; so he sent
out his troops to him and made Bekhtzeman head of the army.
Then they went forth to the field and Khedidan also came forth and ranged
his troops and took the spear and sallied out in person and fought a
sore battle and overcame his enemy, who fled, he and his troops,
ignominiously. When the king and his army returned in triumph, Bekhtzeman
said to him, 'Harkye, O king!
Meseemeth this is a strange thing of thee that thou art compassed about
with this vast army, yet dost thou apply thyself in person to battle
and adventurest thyself.'

Quoth the king, 'Dost thou call thyself a cavalier and a man of
learning and deemest that victory is in abundance of troops?' 'Ay,' answered
Bekhtzeman; 'that is indeed my belief.'

And Khedidan said, 'By Allah, then, thou errest in this thy belief! Woe
and again woe to him whose trust is in other than God! Indeed, this army
is appointed only for adornment and majesty, and victory is from
God alone.

I too, O Bekhtzeman, believed aforetime that victory was in the multitude
of men, and an enemy came out against me with eight hundred men, whilst I
had eight hundred thousand.

I trusted in the number of my troops, whilst mine enemy trusted in God;
so he defeated me and routed me and I was put to a shameful flight
and hid myself in one of the mountains, where I met with a recluse,
[who had] withdrawn [himself from the world].

So I joined myself to him and complained to him of my case and
acquainted him with all that had befallen me.

Quoth he, "Knowest thou why this befell thee and thou wast defeated?"

"I know not," answered I, and he said, "Because thou puttest thy trust in
the multitude of thy troops and reliedst not upon God the Most High.

Hadst thou put thy trust in God and believed in Him that it is He [alone]
who advantageth and endamageth thee, thine enemy had not availed to cope
with thee.

Return unto God." So I returned to myself and repented at the hands of the
solitary, who said to me, "Turn back with what remaineth to thee
of troops and confront thine enemies, for, if their intents be
changed from God, thou wilt overcome them, wert thou alone."

When I heard these words, I put my trust in God the Most High, and gathering
together those who remained with me, fell upon mine enemies at unawares
in the night. They deemed us many and fled on the shamefullest
wise, whereupon I entered my city and repossessed myself of my
place by the might of God the Most High, and now I fight not but
[trusting] in His aid.'

When Bekhtzeman heard this, he awoke from his heedlessness and said,
'Extolled be the perfection of God the Great! O king, this is my case
and my story, nothing added and nought diminished, for I am King
Bekhtzeman and all this happened to me; wherefore I will seek the
gate of God['s mercy] and repent unto Him.'

So he went forth to one of the mountains and there worshipped God
awhile, till one night, as he slept, one appeared to him in a dream
and said to him, 'O Bekhtzeman, God accepteth thy repentance and openeth
on thee [the gate of succour] and will further thee against thine enemy.'
When he was certified of this in the dream, he arose and turned back,
intending for his own city; and when he drew near thereunto, he saw a
company of the king's retainers, who said to him, 'Whence art thou? We see
that thou art a stranger and fear for thee from this king, for that every
stranger who enters this city, he destroys him, of his fear of
King Bekhtzeman.'

Quoth Bekhtzeman, 'None shall hurt him nor advantage him save God the
Most High.' And they answered, saying, 'Indeed, he hath a vast army and
his heart is fortified in the multitude of his troops.'

When King Bekhtzeman heard this, his heart was comforted and he said
in himself, 'I put my trust in God. If He will, I shall overcome mine
enemy by the might of God the Most High.' So he said to the folk, ' Know
ye not who I am?' and they answered, ' No, by Allah.' Quoth he, 'I am
King Bekhtzeman.' When they heard this and knew that it was indeed he, they
dismounted from their horses and kissed his stirrup, to do him honour, and
said to him, 'O king, why hast thou thus adventured thyself?'

Quoth he, 'Indeed, my life is a light matter to me and I put my trust
in God the Most High, looking to Him for protection.' And they answered
him, saying, 'May this suffice thee!

We will do with thee that which is in our power and whereof thou art
worthy:
comfort thy heart, for we will succour thee with our goods and our
lives, and we are his chief officers and the most in favour with him of
all folk. So we will take thee with us and cause the folk follow after
thee, for that the inclination of the people, all of them, is to thee.'
Quoth he, 'Do that unto which God the Most High enableth you.'
So they carried him into the city and hid him with them.
Moreover, they agreed with a company of the king's chief officers, who had
aforetime been those of Bekhtzeman, and acquainted them with this; whereat
they rejoiced with an exceeding joy.

Then they assembled together to Bekhtzeman and made a covenant and handfast
[of fealty] with him and fell upon the enemy at unawares and slew him and
seated King Bekhtzeman again on the throne of his kingship. And his
affairs prospered and God amended his estate and restored His
bounty to him, and he ruled his subjects justly and abode in the
obedience of the Most High.

On this wise, O king," continued the young treasurer, "he with whom God is
and whose intent is pure, meeteth nought but good. As for me, I have no
helper other than God, and I am content to submit myself to His ordinance,
for that He knoweth the purity of my intent."
With this the king's wrath subsided and he said, "Restore him to the prison
till the morrow, so we may look into his affair."
The Seventh Day.

OF CLEMENCY.

When it was the seventh day, the seventh vizier, whose name was Bihkemal,
came in to the king and prostrating himself to him, said, "O king,
what doth thy long-suffering with this youth advantage thee?

Indeed the folk talk of thee and of him. Why, then, dost thou postpone
the putting him to death?" The vizier's words aroused the king's anger
and he bade bring the youth. So they brought him before him, shackled,
and Azadbekht said to him, "Out on thee! By Allah, after this day there
abideth no deliverance for thee from my hand, for that thou hast
outraged mine honour, and there can be no forgiveness for thee."
"O king," answered the youth, "there is no great forgiveness save in case
of a great crime, for according as the offence is great, in so much is
forgiveness magnified and it is no dishonour to the like of thee
if he spare the like of me.

Verily, Allah knoweth that there is no fault in me, and indeed He commandeth
unto clemency, and no clemency is greater than that which spareth
from slaughter, for that thy forgiveness of him whom thou purposest to
put to death is as the quickening of a dead man; and whoso doth
evil shall find it before him, even as it was with King Bihkerd."
"And what is the story of King Bihkerd?" asked the king. "O king,"
answered the youth,

STORY OF KING BIHKERD.

"There was once a king named Bihkerd aed he had wealth galore and many
troops; but his deeds were evil and he would punish for a slight offence
and never forgave.

He went forth one day to hunt and one of his servants shot an arrow, which
lit on the king's ear and cut it off. Quoth Bihkerd, 'Who shot that
arrow?' So the guards brought him in haste the offender, whose name was
Yetrou, and he of his fear fell down on the ground in a swoon. Then
said the king, 'Put him to death;' but Yetrou said, 'O King, this that
hath befallen was not of my choice nor of my knowledge; so do thou pardon
me, in the hour of thy power over me, for that clemency is of the
goodliest of things and belike it shall be [in this world] a provision
and a good work [for which thou shall be requited] one of these
days, and a treasure [laid up to thine account] with God in the
world to come.

Pardon me, therefore, and fend off evil from me, so shall God fend off
from thee evil the like thereof.' When the king heard this, it pleased
him and he pardoned the servant, albeit he had never before pardoned any.

Now this servant was of the sons of the kings and had fled from his father,
on account of an offence he had committed. Then he went and took service
with King Bihkerd and there happened to him what happened.
I want to call my
Alter Ego's attention to this fact gently but firmly, because I have an
idea that she still considers herself "only thirty," and that she thinks
she has just begun to be an Old Maid. Whereas she is old and so am I. I
do not mind it at all. Neither does she; it is only that she had not
realized it. We have so much to think about more important than our stupid
ages. People have grown used to seeing us about, and we like the same
things, and keep going at about the same pace and in the same road, and I
think we have come to be an Institution.

I have no worries which I do not borrow from my married friends. I keep up
with the fashions; my clothes fit me; my fingers still come to the ends of
my gloves; I feel no leaning towards all-over cloth shoes; I have not gone
permanently into bonnets. I have tried to be a pleasant Old Maid, and my
reward is that my friends make me feel as if they liked to have me about.
I am not made to feel that I am _passé_. One's clothes and one's feelings
are all that ever make one _passé_.

Nevertheless, I have turned my face resolutely towards the setting sun. I
am resting now. I have given up struggling against the inevitable. That is
a privilege and an attribute of youth. I feel as though I were only
beginning to live, now that I have passed through the period of turmoil
and come out from the rapids into gently gliding water. There is so much
in life which we could not see at the beginning, but which grows with our
growth and bears us company in the richness of evening-tide. I have
learned to love my life and to cultivate it. thus he weary was certified of

.
Lost faces come before me which I might have
gladdened oftener. Voices sound in my ear whose tones I might have made
happier if I would. Withheld sympathy rises up before me deploring its
wasted treasure. How can any one be happy in looking back? The only
pleasure in looking forward is in hope. Yet now both grief and joy are
tempered with a softness which enfolds my fretted spirit gratefully.

              "Time has laid his hand
    Upon my heart gently; not smiting it,
    But as a harper lays his open palm
    Upon his harp to deaden its vibrations."

And so I am looking forward to-night to an old age more peaceful, less
turbulent, than my youth has been. I reach forward gladly, too, for life
holds much that is sweet to old age, which youth can in no wise
comprehend. Possibly this is one reason why youth is so anxious to
concentrate enjoyment. Now a party of the troops had banded themselves
together for Belehwan; so they sent to him and bringing him privily, went
in to the little Melik Shah and seized him and seated his uncle Belehwan
on the throne of the kingship. Then they proclaimed him king and did
homage to him all, saying, 'Verily, we desire thee and deliver to
thee the throne of the kingship; but we wish of thee that thou slay
not thy brother's son, for that on our consciences are the oaths
we swore to his father and grandfather and the covenants we made
with them.'

                                  So Belehwan granted them this and imprisoned the boy in an underground
dungeon and straitened him.

                                Presently, the
                                    heavy
                               news reached his mother and this was grievous to her; but she could
not speak and committed her affair to God the Most High, daring not
name this to King Caesar her husband, lest she should make her uncle
King Suleiman Shah a liar.

So Belehwan the froward abode king in his father's room and his affairs
prospered, what while the young Melik Shah lay in the underground
dungeon four full-told years, till his charms faded and his favour
changed.

When God (extolled be His perfection and exalted be He!) willed to relieve
him and bring him forth of the prison, Belehwan sat one day with
his chief officers and the grandees of his state and discoursed with
them of the story of King Suleiman Shah and what was in his heart.
Now there were present certain viziers, men of worth, and they
said to him, 'O king, verily God hath been bountiful unto thee and
hath brought thee to thy wish, so that thou art become king in thy
father's stead and hast gotten thee that which thou soughtest.

But, as for this boy, there is no guilt in him, for that, from the day of
his coming into the world, he hath seen neither ease nor joyance,
and indeed his favour is faded and his charms changed [with long
prison].

What is his offence that he should merit this punishment? Indeed, it
is others than he who were to blame, and God hath given thee the victory
over them, and there is no fault in this poor wight.'

Quoth Belehwan, 'Indeed, it is as ye say; but I am fearful of his craft and
am not assured from his mischief; belike the most part of the folk will
incline unto him.' 'O king,' answered they, 'what is this boy and what
power hath he? If thou fear him, send him to one of the frontiers.'
And Belehwan said, 'Ye say sooth: we will send him to be captain
over such an one of the marches.'

Now over against the place in question was a host of enemies, hard of heart,
and in this he purposed the youth's slaughter. So he bade bring him forth
of the underground dungeon and caused him draw near to him and saw
his case.

                           Then he bestowed on him a dress of honour and the folk rejoiced in
this.

Moreover, he tied him an ensign[FN#134] and giving him a numerous
army, despatched him to the region aforesaid, whither all who went
were still slain or made prisoners.

So Melik Shah betook himself thither with his army and when it was one of
the days, behold, the enemy fell in upon them in the night; whereupon
some of his men fled and the rest the enemy took; and they took
Melik Shah also and cast him into an underground dungeon, with a
company of his men.
