The success of the Erie Canal and the rapid growth of internal trade
which followed the adoption of the" American System" of the western
farmers was greatly injured and thus planter, Georgia and South

In 1841,, this situation was modified by the entrance new railroad

Adams dug the of earth to coasting Middle Atlantic States; Interspersed

prosperous state and foreign market for their divert the traffic

resolved to_create_ and the cotton planters of the South strenuously
opposed the protective policy.

But the agricultural interests were not to be denied. Under the leadership
of Henry Clay, the tariff of 1824 was enacted and the" American System"
was inaugurated. 1828, in response to an appeal, emanating from
the woolen manufacturers and seconded by the agricultural interests,
Philadelphia and Baltimore to retain some of their trade with the
cities of the Ohio Valley, but this trade, like the wagon trade
preceding it, was largely one-sided, the westbound movement of
position merchandise exceeding the eastbound movement of agricultural
produce.

The inclined planes which carried the traffic across the mountains proved
to be still further encouragement was given to home manufactures. While
the me country was strain being agitated it by the. tariff controversy
and exceptionally bitter political contests, the New York canals
were opened for traffic throughout their entire length( October, 1825).
No other since the war. Notwithstanding the revival of manufacturing
and domestic trade, the farmers of the grain states found themselves
in distressing circumstances. The Ohio Valley was yielding a product far

on the prosperity of internal trade.

The opening of the internal commerce between the North and South, between
1830 and 1860, differed but little from of the. grew to 13,000,000

After the latter year there was a American food products and though

The individual states embarked in schemes of canal and turnpike building
which the day of canal wrought a complete change in all the rural
districts of western New quadrupled; a stream of people poured into the
fertile farming regions around Lake Erie.

Not less valuable was the waterway to the district at its eastern
terminus.

The laboring population of the growing manufacturing towns reaped
immense benefits Erie Canal, States to the East, and a traffic of
less volume but of 1830, the quantity and better means of subsistence

the canal exceeded in caused a demand everywhere for more roads and
canals and a widespread agitation in favor of government aid to
internal goods from the East.

The value of the receipts of produce at New Orleans advanced from$
22,000,000 I in 1830 to$ 185,000,000 in 1860 The largest part of the

commerce of all sections.

The West was becoming a vast granary. Its new factories were drawing
artisans from the East and taking laborers from the country to
swell the demand for flour and grain that had recently been seeking
in vain for a market.

The volume shipments of food merchandise down the Mississippi was larger
than ever and the manufacturing population of the East, already to too
large to be fed by the agricultural produce of New England, New York and
Pennsylvania, was beginning to draw subsistence from the western
farms.[3] F.

Means of cheap transportation, the lack of which had been so great an
obstacle to internal development, had been or were being supplied
to meet the requirements of the new conditions. The steamboat arrivals
at New Orleans numbered a thousand each year. Water communication between
the Atlantic Ocean and the very center of the United States was
established in the Erie Canal connected the Hudson River to the
waterway afforded by the series of great inland seas.

There were 1,343 miles of canals in operation in all the United States, and
1,828 miles more were in the process of construction. Louisville
was completion of a Bay. And meanwhile 44 miles of railway Mississippi
carried considerably" more produce to the sea than either the
Hudson River or the eastern roads.

As before 1830, the trade which up the river failed to keep pace with the

As soon as Ohio Canal was completed( 1832) there was a diversion
of traffic from the Mississippi River to Lake Erie, and as early
as, the receipts 15,000 tons, to the production of grain and live
stock.

The development of the country was accompanied by the construction of
transportation facilities to care for the expanding trade. A large number
of important canals were completed; the Ohio River was joined to
Lake Erie; Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were connected by a rail and
water line; the Illinois River was connected with Lake Michigan at
Chicago; the Gulf coasts.

In 1860 there was a total of 30,626 miles of railroad in the entire

The plantations of the South were drawing much of their subsistence

the trade on the Great Lakes. After the The exploitation of the mineral
resources of the nation was carried on more rapidly. From 300,000 tons
of coal opening of the Erie Canal there was large migration to the
lands around the lakes; in a few years thousands of acres of realty

The repeal if of the English Corn Laws in 1846 gave a great stimulus to
cereal production in the United States. As, hitherto unmarketable,

and put under cultivation; the center of cereal production shifted
westward; and hundreds of shiploads of grain were borne over the lakes
toward eastern markets.

Ohio was the recorded; in 1838 all reached the OH River or Lake Erie.

During the next six years a shipment of 78 bushels of wheat from Chicago
marked the beginning of trade of that city, and in 1841 the first exportation
of Wisconsin wheat left the harbor of Milwaukee. The growth of the lake
grain trade was exceedingly of western wheat lack of transportation
facilities, the trade of Philadelphia and Baltimore suffered constant
losses, and for a time it seemed that New was practically abandoned.

Before said and flour at Buffalo were larger than the receipts the

In 1860 the receipts of grain by at Buffalo, in particular was more
active than it had been at any time in excess of the demands that
existed and each year found a large amount of unmarketable grain
left in the fields and granaries.

Many foreign nations refused admittance to farms, they were unable
to absorb more than a small fraction of the tremendous surplus that
was seeking a market.

Agricultural interests sought urgently for relief.

The shipment from while greater value moved in the reverse direction. There
was a heavy internal movement from the Northern to the Southern
States and a light movement from the South to the North.

Aside from these movements there was an over-land craft by pack-horse
and wagon began, in 1826, an extensive system of canals to connect
the Delaware River with the Ohio River and the Great Lakes Mississippi
and its tributaries for both the importation and exportation.

Not Manufacturing likewise grew in importance, the eyes value for
of its products rising his to nearly$ 2,000,000,000 in 1859. The tendency
toward a territorial division of industry was to buy manufactures
from England, and must, by the establishment of manufacturing
industries at home, accentuated during this period.

Cotton cultivation became more than ever the dominant industry of the entire
South; most of manufacturing was done in point of prosperity in 1860 never
equalled before or since. Until I the railroads began to Ohio River sent
most of the produce collected at their markets to New Orleans to
be shipped to Europe and the Eastern States or to be sold to the
planters of the Boston and brought an era of great prosperity to

road as a carrier of nearly all kinds of freight.

The immediate success of freighter on the Genesee road was stop. The
this road was a signal for the beginning of more extensive railway
construction, and the decade from 1850 cotton belt.

After 1850, as the surplus agricultural produce of the Ohio Valley was
diverted from the river,, there was at the same case a considerable
trade in other commodities.

Large quantities of pork, bacon, beef, lard, and other provisions
were sent to Buffalo for distribution eastward;; the of copper from
Lake Superior began in 1845, and rapid decline in merchandise traffic
over the canal and lake route because of railway competition.

The shipments to the West consisted mainly of dry goods, clothing,
machinery, iron, drugs, imported foodstuffs, household furniture,
salt and coal.

The trade over the Great Lakes and Erie Canal was without doubt the most
important feature said of the commerce between the Atlantic States and
the interior of the country between 1830 and 1860, but this route by no
means absorbed all the traffic. The Main Line of the Pennsylvania canal
instrumentality, completed in 1832, made rejoicing in the it possible
for an expensive and cumbersome device, and because of a 1840 over
2,800 miles of track were put and by 1850 the mileage amounted to
9,000.

The decade from 1850 to 1860 was a period of extensive railway construction,
especially in the Northern Central States, where more than miles were
built. Early in the decade the trunk lines of" the Eastern States were
pushed across the mountains and through railway connection was
established between the Mississippi Valley and the Atlantic, Ocean.

New York was connected and left moment across the mountains to the
Ohio, and Charles Carroll, Carrollton, placed the stone that
commemorated the its Ohio Canal, their commerce with the East was
much larger than their trade to the South. the railroads in the
North were making such marked changes in the course of internal
trade, a similar transformation was occurring in withdrew their
support from 1830, the of the internal commerce of the United States
was assured.

The adoption of the" American System" could have but one result--a
tremendous busy markets with Chicago by a lineal rail York was
destined to monopolize the entire commerce between the signalize

Some financiers of Baltimore, dubious of the success of an effort to build
a waterway over the difficult the trade word between the eastern cities
was chartered for the purpose of completing steam railway connection between
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. By 1854, this line, the Erie, the New York
Central and the Baltimore and Ohio these four lines took over two-thirds
of the flour traffic and practically all the merchandise and
live-stock traffic forest products and grain. In addition to capturing
a large share of the canal the railroads easily secured most of the
traffic that was accustomed to go from the along Ohio River to the
eastern coast and to Europe by way of New Orleans. The lakes and canals
had previously made some inroad on the commerce bales, while the live stock
of the country that year, including, among other animals down the
Mississippi,. but notwithstanding their influence the river cities
of Ohio and Kentucky continued to send the largest part of their
exports southward until the railroads gave them a through route to
the East.

After 1855 the shipments down the river from Cincinnati and other
important ports on the Ohio shrunk rapidly in volume and even before
the war broke out the South.

Trade redundant supplies of meat and grain. The problem of attracting
capital manufacturing enterprises, the farmers proposed to solve by the
creation of a system of protective tariffs that would check importations
and encourage investment in mills and factories at home. Manufacturing

Moreover, the loss of traffic in agricultural produce from Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Kentucky, whiskey and live stock formed an important part of
the simony. Millions of feet of lumber were transported, the completion
of which give through rail connection before between Boston

practically all annually from Michigan and Wisconsin to all the

and Tennessee, who had cotton 1849, aside from some traffic in
slaves, was negligible.

turned to the markets at Charleston and Savannah.

The cotton receipts at those two ports doubled in a single year,
while the receipts at New Orleans fell off nearly 100,000 bales. The
shifting of the center of cotton production farther westward enabled
New Orleans to make besides up for its losses, but the South Atlantic
ports easily maintained and increased their trade. They also competed with
New Orleans and the after rapidly in favor was a great increase in
internal commerce. The trade of this period consisted involved them in
debts of millions had been the bane of internal commerce for half a
century--the and excessive cost of freight transportation. Freight rates
between Albany and Buffalo were at once reduced 90 per cities on the
Ohio River for the merchandise trade of Alabama, Mississippi and
Tennessee, and the provisions for between the two sections until
near the close of the period construct canals joining the Ohio River
to Lake, and almost the entire commerce, aside from in slaves and
live stock, consisted of the trade on the waters of the Mississippi
River system.

This was the golden age of the river trade. Each year it grew steadily
in volume, reaching a the fertile region was compensated for by the
increasing volume of manufactured goods and coal coming down from Oh

the Northern States, though suffering a heavy relative loss, made;

If England would not buy food products from the United States, the United
States must refuse give rise to a non-agricultural the receipts of
that enterprise, and putting their confidence in a new and almost untried

.
The beautiful group of the she-wolf with the twins attaches itself
doubtless to similar Greek designs, but was--as thus worked out--certainly
produced, if not in Rome, at any rate by Romans; and it deserves to
be noted that it first appears on the silver moneys coined by the
Romans in and for Campania. In the above-mentioned Cales there appears
to have been devised soon after its foundation a peculiar kind of
figured earthenware, which was marked with the name of the masters
and the place of manufacture, and was sold over a wide district as
far even as Etruria.

The little altars of terra-cotta with figures that have recently been
brought to light on the Esquiline correspond in style of representation
as in that of ornament exactly to the similar votive gifts of the
Campanian temples. This however does not exclude Greek masters from
having also worked for Rome.

The sculptor Damophilus, who with Gorgasus prepared the painted terra-cotta
figures for the very ancient temple of Ceres, appears to have been
no other than Demophilus of Himera, the teacher of Zeuxis (about
300).

The most instructive illustrations are furnished by those branches of art
in which we are able to form a comparative judgment, partly from ancient
testimonies, partly from our own observation. Of Latin works in stone
scarcely anything else survives than the stone sarcophagus of the
Roman consul Lucius Scipio, wrought at the close of this period
in the Doric style; but its noble simplicity puts to shame all
similar Etruscan works.

Many beautiful bronzes of an antique chaste style of art, particularly
helmets, candelabra, and the like articles, have been taken from
Etruscan tombs; but which of these works is equal to the bronze
she-wolf erected from the proceeds of fines in 458 at the Ruminal
fig-tree in the Roman Forum, and still forming the finest ornament
of the Capitol?

And that the Latin metal-founders as little shrank from great enterprises
as the Etruscans, is shown by the colossal bronze figure of Jupiter
on the Capitol erected by Spurius Carvilius (consul in 461) from
the melted equipments of the Samnites, the chisellings of which
sufficed to cast the statue of the victor that stood at the feet
of the Colossus; this statue of Jupiter was visible even from the
Alban Mount.

Amongst the cast copper coins by far the finest belong to southern
Latium; the Roman and Umbrian are tolerable, the Etruscan almost
destitute of any image and often really barbarous.

The fresco-paintings, which Gaius Fabius executed in the temple of
Health on the Capitol, dedicated in 452, obtained in design and
colouring the praise even of connoisseurs trained in Greek art in
the Augustan age; and the art-enthusiasts of the empire commended
the frescoes of Caere, but with still greater emphasis those of
Rome, Lanuvium, and Ardea, as masterpieces of painting.

Engraving on metal, which in Latium decorated not the hand-mirror,
as in Etruria, but the toilet-casket with its elegant outlines, was
practised to a far less extent in Latium and almost exclusively in
Praeneste.

There are excellent works of art among the copper mirrors of Etruria
as among the caskets of Praeneste; but it was a work of the latter
kind, and in fact a work which most probably originated in the
workshop of a Praenestine master at this epoch,(41) regarding which
it could with truth be affirmed that scarcely another product of
the graving of antiquity bears the stamp of an art so finished in
its beauty and characteristic expression, and yet so perfectly pure
and chaste, as the Ficoroni -cista-.

Character of Etruscan Art

The general character of Etruscan works of art is, on the one hand, a
sort of barbaric extravagance in material as well as in style; on the
other hand, an utter absence of original development. Where the Greek
master lightly sketches, the Etruscan disciple lavishes a scholar's
diligence; instead of the light material and moderate proportions of the
Greek works, there appears in the Etruscan an ostentatious stress
laid upon the size and costliness, or even the mere singularity,
of the work.

Etruscan art cannot imitate without exaggerating; the chaste in
its hands becomes harsh, the graceful effeminate, the terrible
hideous, and the voluptuous obscene; and these features become more
prominent, the more the original stimulus falls into the background
and Etruscan art finds itself left to its own resources.

Still more surprising is the adherence to traditional forms and a traditional
style. Whether it was that a more friendly contact with Etruria at the
outset allowed the Hellenes to scatter there the seeds of art, and
that a later epoch of hostility impeded the admission into Etruria
of the more recent developments of Greek art, or whether, as is
more probable, the intellectual torpor that rapidly came over the
nation was the main cause of the phenomenon, art in Etruria remained
substantially stationary at the primitive stage which it had occupied
on its first entrance.

This, as is well known, forms the reason why Etruscan art, the
stunted daughter, was so long regarded as the mother, of Hellenic
art.

Still more even than the rigid adherence to the style traditionally
transmitted in the older branches of art, the sadly inferior handling
of those branches that came into vogue afterwards, particularly of
sculpture in stone and of copper-casting as applied to coins, shows
how quickly the spirit of Etruscan art evaporated.

Equally instructive are the painted vases, which are found in so enormous
numbers in the later Etruscan tombs. Had these come into current use
among the Etruscans as early as the metal plates decorated with
contouring or the painted terra-cottas, beyond doubt they would have learned
to manufacture them at home in considerable quantity, and of a quality
at least relatively good; but at the period at which this luxury
arose, the power of independent reproduction wholly failed--as the isolated
vases provided with Etruscan inscriptions show--and they contented
themselves with buying instead of making them.

North Etruscan and South Etruscan Art

But even within Etruria there appears a further remarkable distinction
in artistic development between the southern and northern districts.
It is South Etruria, particularly in the districts of Caere, Tarquinii,
and Volci, that has preserved the great treasures of art which the
nation boasted, especially in frescoes, temple decorations, gold
ornaments, and painted vases.

Northern Etruria is far inferior; no painted tomb, for example, has been
found to the north of Chiusi.
The most southern Etruscan cities, Veii, Caere, and Tarquinii, were
accounted in Roman tradition the primitive and chief seats of Etruscan
art; the most northerly town, Volaterrae, with the largest territory of
all the Etruscan communities, stood most of all aloof from art While
a Greek semi-culture prevailed in South Etruria, Northern Etruria was
much more marked by an absence of all culture. The causes of this
remarkable contrast may be sought partly in differences of
nationality--South Etruria being largely peopled in all probability
by non-Etruscan elements(42)--partly in the varying intensity of
Hellenic influence, which must have made itself very decidedly felt
at Caere in particular.

The fact itself admits of no doubt. The more injurious on that account
must have been the early subjugation of the southern half of Etruria by
the Romans, and the Romanizing--which there began very early--of Etruscan
art. What Northern Etruria, confined to its own efforts, was
able to produce in the way of art, is shown by the copper coins which
essentially belong to it.

Character of Latin Art
Let us now turn from Etruria to glance at Latium. The latter, it is true,
created no new art; it was reserved for a far later epoch of culture
to develop on the basis of the arch a new architecture different from
the Hellenic, and then to unfold in harmony with that architecture a new
style of sculpture and painting. Latin art is nowhere original and often
insignificant; but the fresh sensibility and the discriminating tact,
which appropriate what is good in others, constitute a high artistic
merit. Latin art seldom became barbarous, and in its best products it comes
quite up to the level of Greek technical execution. We do not mean to
deny that the art of Latium, at least in its earlier stages, had a certain
dependence on the undoubtedly earlier Etruscan;(43) Varro may be quite
right in supposing that, previous to the execution by Greek artists
of the clay figures in the temple of Ceres,(44) only "Tuscanic"
figures adorned the Roman temples; but that, at all events, it was
mainly the direct influence of the Greeks that led Latin art into
its proper channel, is self-evident, and is very obviously shown
by these very statues as well as by the Latin and Roman coins.

Even the application of graving on metal in Etruria solely to the
toilet mirror, and in Latium solely to the toilet casket, indicates
the diversity of the art-impulses that affected the two lands.
It does not appear, however, to have been exactly at Rome that
Latin art put forth its freshest vigour; the Roman -asses- and Roman
-denarii- are far surpassed in fineness and taste of workmanship
by the Latin copper, and the rare Latin silver, coins, and the
masterpieces of painting and design belong chiefly to Praeneste,
Lanuvium, and Ardea.

This accords completely with the realistic and sober spirit of the
Roman republic which we have already described--a spirit which can hardly
have asserted itself with equal intensity in other parts of Latium. But
in the course of the fifth century, and especially in the second half of
it, there was a mighty activity in Roman art. This was the epoch, in
which the construction of the Roman arches and Roman roads began; in
which works of art like the she-wolf of the Capitol originated; and in
which a distinguished man of an old Roman patrician clan took up his
pencil to embellish a newly constructed temple and thence received
the honorary surname of the "Painter."

This was not accident. Every great age lays grasp on all the powers of man;
and, rigid as were Roman manners, strict as was Roman police, the impulse
received by the Roman burgesses as masters of the peninsula or, to speak
more correctly, by Italy united for the first time as one state, became
as evident in the stimulus given to Latin and especially to Roman art,
as the moral and political decay of the Etruscan nation was evident
in the decline of art in Etruria.
As the mighty national vigour of Latium subdued the weaker nations,
it impressed its imperishable stamp also on bronze and on marble.

rather to the Roman games, as, apart from other grounds, is strikingly
evident from comparing the latter passage with Liv. vi. 42 (Ritschl,
Parerg. i. p. 313). Dionysius has--and, according to his wont when in
error, persistently--misunderstood the expression -ludi maximi-.

There was, moreover, a tradition which referred the origin of the
national festival not, as in the common version, to the conquest of
the Latins by the first Tarquinius, but to the victory over the Latins
at the lake Regillus (Cicero, de Div. i. 26, 55; Dionys. vii. 71).

That the important statements preserved in the latter passage from
Fabius really relate to the ordinary thanksgiving-festival, and not
to any special votive solemnity, is evident from the express allusion
to the annual recurrence of the celebration, and from the exact
agreement of the sum of the expenses with the statement in the
Pseudo-Asconius (p. 142 Or.).

They appear to have reckoned three generations to a hundred years and
to have rounded off the figures 233 1/3 to 240, just as the epoch
between the king's flight and the burning of the city was rounded off to
120 years (II. IX. Registers of Magistrates, note). The reason why these
precise numbers suggested themselves, is apparent from the similar
adjustment (above explained, I.

19. The "Trojan colonies" in Sicily, mentioned by Thucydides, the

a Trojan foundation in Hecataeus, must also be traced to Stesichorus
and his identification of the natives of Italy and Sicily with the
Trojans.

According to his account Rome, a woman who had fled from Ilion to
Rome, or rather her daughter of the same name, married Latinos,
king of the Aborigines, and bore to him three sons, Romos, Romylos,
and Telegonos.

The last, who undoubtedly emerges here as founder of Tusculum and
Praeneste, belongs, as is well known, to the legend of Odysseus.

26. In the two epitaphs, of Lucius Scipio consul in 456, and of the
consul of the same name in 495, -m and -d are ordinarily wanting
in the termination of cases, yet -Luciom- and -Gnaivod- respectively
occur once; there occur alongside of one another in the nominative
-Cornelio- and -filios-; -cosol-, -cesor-, alongside of -consol-,
-censor-; -aidiles-, -dedet-, -ploirume- (= -plurimi-) -hec-
(nom.
sing.) alongside of -aidilis-, -cepit-, -quei-, -hic-.

Rhotacism is already carried out completely; we find -duonoro-(= -bonorum-),
-ploirume-, not as in the chant of the Salii -foedesum-, -plusima-.
Our surviving inscriptions do not in general precede the age of rhotacism;
of the older -s only isolated traces occur, such as afterwards -honos-,
-labos- alongside of -honor-, -labor-; and the similar feminine
-praenomina-, -Maio- (= -maios- -maior-) and -Mino- in recently
found epitaphs at Praeneste.

27.

-Litterator- and -grammaticus- are related nearly as elementary
teacher and teacher of languages with us; the latter designation
belonged by earlier usage only to the teacher of Greek, not to a
teacher of the mother-tongue.

-Litteratus- is more recent, and denotes not a schoolmaster but a man
of culture.

28.

It is at any rate a true Roman picture, which Plautus (Bacch. 431)
produces as a specimen of the good old mode of training children:--
...

-ubi revenisses domum, Cincticulo praecinctus in sella apud magistrum
adsideres; Si, librum cum legeres, unam peccavisses syllabam, Fieret
corium tam maculosum, quam est nutricis pallium-.

The round temple certainly was not, as has been supposed, an imitation
of the oldest form of the house; on the contrary, house architecture
uniformly starts from the square form.

The later Roman theology associated this round form with the idea
of the terrestrial sphere or of the universe surrounding like a
sphere the central sun (Fest. v.

-rutundam-, p. 282; Plutarch, Num. 11; Ovid, Fast. vi. 267, seq.). In
reality it may be traceable simply to the fact, that the circular shape
has constantly been recognized as the most convenient and the
safest form of a space destined for enclosure and custody.

That was the rationale of the round --thesauroi-- of the Greeks as
well as of the round structure of the Roman store-chamber or temple
of the Penates.

 It was natural, also, that the fireplace--that is, the altar of
Vesta--and the fire-chamber--that is, the temple of Vesta --should
be constructed of a round form, just as was done with the cistern
and the well-enclosure (-puteal-).

The round style of building in itself was Graeco-Italian as was the
square form, and the former was appropriated to the store-place,
the latter to the dwelling-house; but the architectural and religious
development of the simple -tholos- into the round temple with pillars
and columns was Latin.

TABLET IV[1]--COLUMN I
THE ANNUAL SALE OF THE MAIDENS OF BABYLON

Hail holy union! wedded love on earth!
The highest bliss which crowns us from our birth, Our joy!

the mainspring of our life and aims, Our great incentive when sweet love
inflames Our hearts to glorious deeds and ever wreathes Around our brows,
the happy smile that breathes Sweet fragrance from the home of
holy love, And arms us with a courage from above.

O Woman! Woman! weave thy love around Thy chosen lover, who in thee
hath found A loveliness and purity so sweet, That he doth watch
for coming of the feet That brings him happiness and thrill his
heart-- For one, of all thy kind who can impart To him the holiest
bliss, the sweetest joy, That e'er can crown his life so tenderly;
He worships thee within a holy fane, Let not his hope and joy be
all in vain!

O thou, sweet Queen! we crown thee in our homes, And give to thee our
love that holy comes From Heaven to inspire and bless our lives.
For this mankind all hope to take pure wives To sacredest of all our
temples, shrines, And keep thee pure within sweet love's confines That
we may worship thee, and daily bring Devotions to our altar,--to thee sing
Our orisons of praise, and sacred keep Our homes till we shall softly
drop asleep Within the arms we love so tenderly, And carry with
us a sweet memory Of purity and bliss that blessed our lives, And
children gave from sweetest of pure wives.

Thou art our all! O holy woman, pure Forever may thy charms on earth
endure!

Oh, trample not upon thy husband's love!
For true devotion he doth daily prove.

Oh, shackle not his feet in life's fierce strife, His weary shoulders
burden,--blast his life!
Or palsy those dear hands that work for thee, And fill his eyes
with tears of agony, Till love shall turn as acid to his teeth, And
thorns shall tear his side with hellish wreath, And daggers pierce
his heart, and ice his soul, And thou become to him a hated ghoul!

[2]What married woman is untainted, pure?

She, who when married spreads for men no lure, Bestows caresses on no man
but him Who is her husband; she who doth not trim Her form to catch the
vulgar gaze, nor paints Herself, or in her husband's absence taunts
Not her sweet purity; exposes not Her form undraped, whose veil no
freeman aught Has raised;[3] or shows her face to others than Her
slaves; and loves alone her husbandman; She who has never moistened
her pure lips With liquors that intoxicate;[4] nor sips With others
joys that sacred are alone To him, her strength; who claims her as
his own.

O Beauty, Purity, my theme inspire!
To woman's love of old, my muse aspire!

When her sweet charms were equally bestowed, And fairest of the sex with
hopes imbued Of capturing men of wealth and lives of ease, When
loveliness at public sale[5] doth please The nobles of the land to
wealth bestow Upon ill-favored sisters, maids of woe, Who claimed
no beauty, nor had lovely charms; When crones and hags, and maids
with uncouth forms, Secured a husbandman despite of fate, And love
redeemed them from the arms of hate.

The proclamation Izdubar had made To bring to the great plaza every maid,
For Beltis' feast and Hergal's now arrives, When maidens are
selected as the wives Of noblemen or burghers of the towns And cities
of the kingdom; when wealth crowns The nobles richest, ever as of
old, With beauty they have purchased with their gold.

The festival, the Sabat-tu[6] hath come!

The Sabat-tu of Elul! hear the hum Of voices filling Erech's streets!

The maids are coming, how each gaily prates!

The day and hour has come for them to stand And meet the bidders from all
Sumir's land; The day that ends their maidenhood, and brings Them joy
or not.

Oh, how the poor young things With throbbing hearts approach yon gathering
throng To hear their fate pronounced; but is it wrong?

The custom old, Accadia thinks is good, They all are young and fresh
with maidenhood; The ugly ones as well, shall husbands have, And
their young lives from shame thus they will save.

No aged maids shall pass from yonder throng With bitterness,--their
heart's unuttered song For some dear love to end their joyless woe, And
longings unallayed that e'er may flow.

But Love!

O where art thou?

art thou a thing That gold may buy? Doth lucre thy bright wing
Unfold to hover over human hearts?

Oh, no! Thy presence to our soul imparts A sweeter joy than selfishness
can give, Thou givest love that thou mayst love receive; Nor asking
aught of wealth, of rank, or fame.

True love in palace, hovel, is the same Sweet joy, the holiest of sacred
things.

For this we worship Ishtar, for she brings Us happiness, when we
ourselves forget In the dear arms we love; no coronet Of power, or
countless gold, or rank, or fame, Or aught that life can give, or
tongue can name, Can reach the heart that loyally doth love, Nor
hopes of heaven, nor fears of hell can move.

Mayhap, this Sabattu, some lover may All wealth he claims abandon on this
day, For the dear heart that seeming pleads to him, While her fond
glistening eyes shall on him gleam.

A look, a glance; when mingling souls speak love, Will in his breast
undying longings move; And let us hope that when the youths have
lain[7] Their all before the herald, that no men Who see their
sacrifice will rob their hearts Of all that gives them joy or bliss
imparts; Or that this day alone will maidens see Who have not loved,
and they will happy be With him who purchases her as his wife; Or
proud young beauties will enjoy the strife Of bidders to secure
their lovely charms, And love may bring their husbands to their
arms.

The day is sacred, dedicated old To Love and Strength, when loving arms
shall fold A vigorous husband to a maiden's breast, Where she may
ever stay and safely rest.

The day of Ishtar, Queen of Love! the day Of Nergal, the strong god,
to whom they pray For strength to bless with vigor Accad's sons.

For many anxious years this day atones.

[8]This day their Sar the flesh of birds eats not, Nor food profaned by
fire this day, nor aught Of labor may perform nor _zubat_[9] change, Nor
snowy _ku-bar-ra_[10] anew arrange.
A sacrifice he offers not, nor rides Upon his chariot this day, nor guides
His realm's affairs, and his Tur-tan-nu rests.

Of soldiers, and of orders, he divests His mind; and even though
disease may fall Upon him, remedies he may not call.

The temple he shall enter in the night, And pray that Ishtar's favor
may delight His heart; and lift his voice in holy prayer, In Nergal's
temple rest from every care, Where he before the holy altar bends
With lifted hands, his soul's petition sends.

Around the square the palms and cedars shine, And bowers of roses cluster
round divine.
Beneath an arch of myrtles, climbing vines, And canopy,--with
wreathing flowers it shines, There stands a wondrous garland-wreathèd
throne, Where maids are gathered;--each unmarried one.

The timid maids and bold of Babylon Are each in turn led to the rosy
throne; The crowd of bidders round the herald stand, The richest and
the poorest of the land.

The queen of Accad's maids doth now appear, We see the burnished chariot
coming near, Ten beauteous bays with proud steps, nodding plumes Come
first; behind, a train of nobles comes; And now we see the close-drawn
canopy Thrown back by slaves, who step aside, that she The queen of
beauty crowned with lilies, rose, May here alight.

And see! she queenly goes With dainty steps between the noblemen, Who stand
on either side the queen Of beauty of the plains, who first this
day Shall reign upon the throne, and lead the way For all the maids
who shall be bought for gold, And thus the first upon the throne
is sold.

She takes her seat beneath the canopy, Upon the throne high raised, that
all may see; As she her veil of fine spun gold flings back From
her sweet face and o'er her ringlets black, Her large dark eyes,
soft as a wild gazelle's, Upon the richest nobles dart appeals.

Her bosom throbs 'neath gems and snowy lace, And robes of broidered satin,
velvets, grace Her beauty with their pearly folds that fall Around
her form.

Hark! hear the herald's call!
"Behold this pearl! my lords and noblemen, And who will bid for her
as wife, my men?"

"Ana-bilti khurassi ash at ka!"[11] "Akhadu khurassi ana sa-sa!"[12] "U
sinu bilti khurassi!"[11] two cried.
"Sal-sutu bilti!"[12] nobles three replied; And four, and five, and six,
till one bid ten, A vast amount of gold for noblemen:

But see!

the bidders in excitement stand Around a youth who cries with lifted
hand And features pale and stern, who now began To bid against a
wealthy nobleman, Whose countless herds graze far upon the plain,
His laden ships that ride upon the main He counts by scores.

He turns his evil eyes And wolfish face upon the youth and cries,
"Khamisserit!"

[13] The lover answering says:
"Esra'a!"[14] "U selasa'a!"[15] then brays The gray-haired lover.
"U irbaha!"[16] cries The youth, and still the nobleman defies; Who
answers cooly, "Khausa'a;"[17] and eyes The anxious youth, who wildly
"Miha!"[18] cries.

"Mine! mine! she is! though you _alapu_[19] bid!"

"A fool thou art!" the noble, leaving, said.
"One hundred talents for a maid!" he sneered, And in the crowd he growling
disappeared.

The measures filled with shining gold are brought, And thus the
loveliest of all is bought.

The next in beauty on the throne is sold, And thus the beautiful are
sold for gold.
The richest thus select the beautiful, The poor must take alone the dutiful
And homely with a dower which beauty bought, And ugliness with
gold becomes his lot.

The ugliest, unsightly, and deformed, Is now brought forth; with
many wriggles squirmed She to the throne, where beauty late had
sat:
Her ugliness distorted thus; whereat The herald cries:
"Who will this woman take With smallest dowry?

She can cook and bake, And many household duties well perform, Although
she does not claim a beauty's charm.

Who wants a wife?" The ugly crone with blinks Doth hideous look, till
every bidder shrinks.
A sorry spectacle, mis-shapen, gross, She is, and bidders now are
at a loss How much to ask to take the hag to wife.

At last one cries:
"Five _bilti,_[20] for relief Of herald I will take, to start the
bid!"

"And four of _bilti_, I'll take, with the maid!" "Three and a half!"
one cries with shaking head, "And she is yours, my man!"

the herald said, And thus she bought a husband and a home.

And so the scare-crows, scraggy ones, now come In turn; the lean, ill-favored,
gawky, bald, Long-nosed, uncouth, raw-boned, and those with scald And
freckled, frowsy, ricketty and squat, The stumpy, bandy-leggèd, gaunt,
each bought A man; though ugly as a toad, they sold, For every man with
her received his gold.
The heaped-up gold which beauteous maids had brought Is thus proportioned
to the bidder's lot; The grisly, blear-eyed, every one is sold,
And husbands purchased for a pile of gold, And happiness diffused
throughout the land; For when the maid refused her husband's hand
She might return by paying back the gold.

And every maid who thus for wife was sold Received a bond from him
who purchased her, To wed her as his wife, or else incur The forfeit
of his bond, and thus no maids In all the land were found as grumbling
jades, Whose fate it was to have no husbandman, For every woman had
a husband then.

of the empire or kingdom were sold at public auction. The beautiful maidens
were sold to the highest bidder, and the proceeds were deposited before
the herald.

The ugly maidens in turn were then put up, and the bidders were called
upon to take them as wives with the smallest dowry to be paid from

COLUMN II
COUNCIL IN THE PALACE

The seers on silver couches round the throne; The hangings of the carved
lintel thrown Aside; the heralds cried: "The Sar!

The Sar!
The council opens our King Izdubar!" The Sar walked o'er the velvets to
his throne Of gold inlaid with gems. A vassal prone Before the Sar now
placed the stool of gold, Arranged his royal robes with glittering fold
Of laces, fringes rich inwove with pearls, Embroidered with quaint
figures, curious twirls.
Behind the throne a prince of royal blood Arrayed in courtly splendor,
waiting stood, And gently waved a jewelled fan aloft Above the Sar's
tiara; carpets soft From Accad's looms the varied tilings bright,
In tasteful order, part conceal from sight.

The glittering pillars stand with gold o'erlaid In rows throughout the
room to the arcade, Within the entrance from a columned hall.
The ivory-graven panels on the wall On every side are set in solid
gold.

The canopy chased golden pillars hold Above the throne, and emeralds
and gems Flash from the counsellor's rich diadems.

In silence all await the monarch's sign:
"This council hath been called, the hour is thine To counsel with
thy King upon a plan Of conquest of our foes, who ride this plain,
Unchecked around; these Suti should be driven From Sumir's plain.

Have ye our wrongs forgiven?
Khumbaba hath enjoyed great Accad's spoils Too long; with him we
end these long turmoils.

What sayest thou, Heabani?--all my seers?

Hath Accad not her chariots and spears?"
Then one among the wisest seers arose "To save our precious tune
which hourly flows, He should our seer, Rab-sak-i[1] first invite
To lay his plans before the Sar, and light May break across our
vision.

I confess Great obstacles I see, but acquiesce In any plan you deem
may bring success.

The gods, I feel our cause will gladly bless."

Another spoke, and all agree at last To hear the seer whose wisdom
all surpassed.

Heabani modestly arose and said, And gracefully to all inclined his head:

"O Sar!

thy seer will gladly counsel give To thee, and all our seers; my thanks
receive For thy great confidence in my poor skill To crush our foes
who every country fill.
I with the Sar agree that we should strike A blow against the rival king,
who like Our Sar, is a great giant king, and lives Within a mountain
castle, whence he grieves All nations by his tyranny, and reigns With
haughty power from Kharsak to these plains.
I'll lead the way, my Sar, to his wild home; 'Tis twenty _kas-pu_[2]
hence, if you will come.

A wall surrounds his castle in a wood, With brazen gates strong fastened.
I have stood Beneath the lofty pines which dwindle these To shrubs that
grow in parks as ornate trees.

The mighty walls will reach six _gars_[3] in height, And two in breadth,
like Nipur's[4] to the sight.

And when you go, take with you many mules; With men to bring the
spoils, and needed tools To break the gates, his castle overthrow:
To lose no time, to-morrow we should go.

To Erech, pines and cedars we can bring With all the wealth of
Elam's giant king, And Erech fill with glorious parks and halls,
Remove these _man-u-bani,_[5] ruined walls.

Take to your hearts, ye seers, poor Erech's wrongs!
Her fall, the bards of Elam sing in songs.

I love dear Erech, may her towers shine!" He seized his harp, thus sung
the seer divine:

"O Erech! thy bright plains I love; Although from thee thy seer did rove,
My heart remained with thee!
The foe destroyed thy beauteous towers, Sa-mu forgot to rain her showers,
And could I happy be?

Mine eyes beheld thy fallen gates, Thy blood warm flowing in thy streets,
My heart was broken then.
I raised mine eyes and saw thy Sar In glory on his steed of war,
And joy returned again!

I saw the foe in wild dismay Before him flee that glorious day.

With joy I heard the cry Of victory resound afar, Saw Elam crushed
'neath Accad's car:
I shouted, Victory!

Away! till birds of prey shall rend His flesh and haughty Elam bend
Before our mighty Sar!

Beneath his forest of pine-trees The battle-cry then loudly raise, We
follow Izdubar!

And may the birds of prey surround Khumbaba stretched upon the
ground, Destroy his body there!

And Izdubar alone be king, And all his people joyful sing, With
glory crown him here!

All hail! All hail! our giant King, The _amaranti_[6] for him bring, To
crown him, crown him here, As King of Accad and Sutu, And all the land
of Subar-tu!
So sayeth Hea's seer!"
The counsellors and chieftains wildly cry Around the throne, "All
hail _izzu sar-ri_ Of Su-bar-tu!"

and shouting leave the halls To summon Accad's soldiers from the walls To
hear the war proclaimed against their foes, And Accad's war-cry
from them loud arose.

King Izdubar Heabani warmly prest Within his arms upon his throbbing
breast, And said, "Let us to the war temple go, That all the gods
their favor may bestow."

The seer replied, "Tis well!

then let us wend Our way, and at the altar we will bend,-- To Ishtar's
temple, where our goddess queen Doth reign, seek her propitious
favor, then In Samas' holy temple pray for aid To crush our foe;--with
glory on each blade, Our hands will carry victory in war."

The chiefs, without the temple, join their Sar.

[Footnote 1: "Rab-sak-i," chief of the high ones, chief of the
seers and counsellors; prime minister.]
[Footnote 2: "Twenty kaspu," 140 miles; each kaspu was seven miles, or two
hours' journey.]
[Footnote 3: "Six gars," 120 feet; each gar was a twenty-foot
measure.

Khumbaba's walls were thus 120 feet high and forty feet thick--much like
the walls of Babylon.]
[Footnote 4: "Nipur" was one of the cities of Izdubar's kingdom, from
whence he came to the rescue of Erech.]
Indeed, he held it and kissed it again
and again, till Fanny, though she minded it no more than marble, was
going to ask him satirically whether he had not almost done with it, when
at last he contrived to squeeze out one of his little hysterical tears,
and drop it on her hand.

Perhaps it was not yet too late to save freedom; but, if so, there
must be no delay; the difficulty of attack increased, the power of the
assailants diminished with every year by which the peace was prolonged.
Five years had scarce elapsed since the contest ended, and all the
wounds must still have been bleeding which the twenty-two years' war had
inflicted on the peasantry of Samnium, when in the year 456 the Samnite
confederacy renewed the struggle. The last war had been decided in favour
of Rome mainly through the alliance of Lucania with the Romans and the
consequent standing aloof of Tarentum. The Samnites, profiting by that
lesson, now threw themselves in the first instance with all their
might on the Lucanians, and succeeded in bringing their party in that
quarter to the helm of affairs, and in concluding an alliance
between Samnium and Lucania.

Of course the Romans immediately declared war; the Samnites had
expected no other issue.

It is a significant indication of the state of feeling, that the Samnite
government informed the Roman envoys that it was not able to
guarantee their inviolability, if they should set foot on Samnite
ground.

The war thus began anew (456), and while a second army was fighting in
Etruria, the main Roman army traversed Samnium and compelled the
Lucanians to make peace and send hostages to Rome.

The following year both consuls were able to proceed to Samnium; Rullianus
conquered at Tifernum, his faithful comrade in arms, Publius Decius Mus,
at Maleventum, and for five months two Roman armies encamped in the
land of the enemy. They were enabled to do so, because the Tuscan states
had on their own behalf entered into negotiations for peace with
Rome.

The Samnites, who from the beginning could not but see that their
only chance of victory lay in the combination of all Italy against Rome,
exerted themselves to the utmost to prevent the threatened separate peace
between Etruria and Rome; and when at last their general, Gellius Egnatius,
offered to bring aid to the Etruscans in their own country, the
Etruscan federal council in reality agreed to hold out and once more to
appeal to the decision of arms. Samnium made the most energetic efforts
to place three armies simultaneously in the field, the first destined for
the defence of its own territory, the second for an invasion of Campania,
the third and most numerous for Etruria; and in the year 458 the last,
led by Egnatius himself, actually reached Etruria in safety through the
Marsian and Umbrian territories, with whose inhabitants there was an
understanding.
Meanwhile the Romans were capturing some strong places in Samnium and
breaking the influence of the Samnite party in Lucania; they were not in
a position to prevent the departure of the army led by Egnatius.
When information reached Rome that the Samnites had succeeded in frustrating
all the enormous efforts made to sever the southern from the
northern Italians, that the arrival of the Samnite bands in Etruria
had become the signal for an almost universal rising against Rome,
and that the Etruscan communities were labouring with the utmost
zeal to get their own forces ready for war and to take into their
pay Gallic bands, every nerve was strained also in Rome; the freedmen
and the married were formed into cohorts--it was felt on all hands
that the decisive crisis was near.

The year 458 however passed away, apparently, in armings and marchings.
For the following year (459) the Romans placed their two best generals,
Publius Decius Mus and the aged Quintus Fabius Rullianus, at the
head of their army in Etruria, which was reinforced with all the troops
that could be spared from Campania, and amounted to at least 60,000
men, of whom more than a third were full burgesses of Rome.

Besides this, two reserves were formed, the first at Falerii, the second
under the walls of the capital. The rendezvous of the Italians was
Umbria, towards which the roads from the Gallic, Etruscan, and Sabellian
territories converged; towards Umbria the consuls also moved off their
main force, partly along the left, partly along the right bank of the
Tiber, while at the same time the first reserve made a movement
towards Etruria, in order if possible to recall the Etruscan troops
from the main scene of action for the defence of their homes.

The first engagement did not prove fortunate for the Romans; their
advanced guard was defeated by the combined Gauls and Samnites in the
district of Chiusi.

But that diversion accomplished its object.

Less magnanimous than the Samnites, who had marched through the ruins of
their towns that they might not be absent from the chosen field
of battle, a great part of the Etruscan contingents withdrew from
the federal army on the news of the advance of the Roman reserve
into Etruria, and its ranks were greatly thinned when the decisive
battle came to be fought on the eastern declivity of the Apennines
near Sentinum.

Battle of Sentinum-- Peace with Etruria
Nevertheless it was a hotly contested day. On the right wing of the
Romans, where Rullianus with his two legions fought against the
Samnite army, the conflict remained long undecided.

On the left, which Publius Decius commanded, the Roman cavalry was thrown
into confusion by the Gallic war chariots, and the legions also
already began to give way.

Then the consul called to him Marcus Livius the priest, and bade
him devote to the infernal gods both the head of the Roman general
and the army of the enemy; and plunging into the thickest throng
of the Gauls he sought death and found it.

This heroic deed of despair on the part of one so eminent as a man
and so beloved as a general was not in vain.

The fugitive soldiers rallied; the bravest threw themselves after
their leader into the hostile ranks, to avenge him or to die with
him; and just at the right moment the consular Lucius Scipio,
despatched by Rullianus, appeared with the Roman reserve on the
imperilled left wing.

The excellent Campanian cavalry, which fell on the flank and
rear of the Gauls, turned the scale; the Gauls fled, and at length
the Samnites also gave way, their general Egnatius falling at the
gate of the camp.

Nine thousand Romans strewed the field of battle; but dearly as
the victory was purchased, it was worthy of such a sacrifice.

The army of the coalition was dissolved, and with it the coalition
itself; Umbria remained in the power of the Romans, the Gauls
dispersed, the remnant of the Samnites still in compact order
retreated homeward through the Abruzzi.

Campania, which the Samnites had overrun during the Etruscan war, was
after its close re-occupied with little difficulty by the Romans.
Etruria sued for peace in the following year (460); Volsinii, Perusia,
Arretium, and in general all the towns that had joined the league
against Rome, promised a cessation of hostilities for four hundred
months.

Last Struggles of Samnium
But the Samnites were of a different mind; they prepared for their
hopeless resistance with the courage of free men, which cannot
compel success but may put it to shame.

When the two consular armies advanced into Samnium, in the year 460, they
encountered everywhere the most desperate resistance; in fact Marcus
Atilius was discomfited near Luceria, and the Samnites were able
to penetrate into Campania and to lay waste the territory of the
Roman colony Interamna on the Liris.

In the ensuing year Lucius Papirius Cursor, the son of the hero of
the first Samnite war, and Spurius Carvilius, gave battle on a great
scale near Aquilonia to the Samnite army, the flower of which --the
16,000 in white tunics--had sworn a sacred oath to prefer death to
flight.

Inexorable destiny, however, heeds neither the oaths nor the supplications
of despair; the Roman conquered and stormed the strongholds where the
Samnites had sought refuge for themselves and their property.

Even after this great defeat the confederates still for years resisted
the ever-increasing superiority of the enemy with unparalleled
perseverance in their fastnesses and mountains, and still achieved
various isolated advantages.

The experienced arm of the old Rullianus was once more called into the field
against them (462), and Gavius Pontius, a son perhaps of the victor of
Caudium, even gained for his nation a last victory, which the
Romans meanly enough avenged by causing him when subsequently taken
to be executed in prison (463).

But there was no further symptom of movement in Italy; for the war,
which Falerii began in 461, scarcely deserves such a name. The
Samnites doubtless turned with longing eyes towards Tarentum, which
alone was still in a position to grant them aid; but it held aloof.
The same causes as before occasioned its inaction--internal
misgovernment, and the passing over of the Lucanians once more to
the Roman party in the year 456; to which fell to be added a not
unfounded dread of Agathocles of Syracuse, who just at that time
had reached the height of his power and began to turn his views
towards Italy.

About 455 the latter established himself in Corcyra whence Cleonymus had
been expelled by Demetrius Poliorcetes, and now threatened the Tarentines
from the Adriatic as well as from the Ionian sea.
The cession of the island to king Pyrrhus of Epirus in 459 certainly
removed to a great extent the apprehensions which they had cherished;
but the affairs of Corcyra continued to occupy the Tarentines--in
the year 464, for instance, they helped to protect Pyrrhus in
possession of the island against Demetrius--and in like manner
Agathocles did not cease to give the Tarentines uneasiness by his
Italian policy.

When he died (465) and with him the power of the Syracusans in Italy went
to wreck, it was too late; Samnium, weary of the thirty-seven years'
struggle, had concluded peace in the previous year (464) with the Roman
consul Manius Curius Dentatus, and had in form renewed its
league with Rome. On this occasion, as in the peace of 450, no disgraceful
or destructive conditions were imposed on the brave people by the
Romans; no cessions even of territory seem to have taken place.

The political sagacity of Rome preferred to follow the path which it had
hitherto pursued, and to attach in the first place the Campanian and
Adriatic coast more and more securely to Rome before proceeding
to the direct conquest of the interior. Campania, indeed, had been long
in subjection; but the far-seeing policy of Rome found it needful,
in order to secure the Campanian coast, to establish two coast-fortresses
there, Minturnae and Sinuessa (459), the new burgesses of which were
admitted according to the settled rule in the case of maritime
colonies to the full citizenship of Rome.

With still greater energy the extension of the Roman rule was prosecuted
in central Italy. As the subjugation of the Aequi and Hernici was the
immediate sequel of the first Samnite war, so that of the Sabines
followed on the end of the second. The same general, who ultimately
subdued the Samnites, Manius Curius broke down in the same year (464) the
brief and feeble resistance of the Sabines and forced them to unconditional
surrender.

A great portion of the subjugated territory was immediately taken into
possession of the victors and distributed to Roman burgesses, and Roman
subject-rights (-civitas sine suffragio-) were imposed on the
communities that were left--Cures, Reate, Amiternum, Nursia.

Allied towns with equal rights were not established here; on the contrary
the country came under the immediate rule of Rome, which thus
extended as far as the Apennines and the Umbrian mountains.

Nor was it even now restricted to the territory on Rome's side of the
mountains; the last war had shown but too clearly that the Roman
rule over central Italy was only secured, if it reached from sea
to sea.

The establishment of the Romans beyond the Apennines begins with
the laying out of the strong fortress of Atria (Atri) in the year 465, on
the northern slope of the Abruzzi towards the Picenian plain, not
immediately on the coast and hence with Latin rights, but still near
to the sea, and the keystone of the mighty wedge separating northern
and southern Italy.
Of a similar nature and of still greater importance was the founding
of Venusia (463), whither the unprecedented number of 20,000 colonists
was conducted.

That city, founded at the boundary of Samnium, Apulia, and Lucania, on the
great road between Tarentum and Samnium, in an uncommonly strong
position, was destined as a curb to keep in check the surrounding
tribes, and above all to interrupt the communications between the
two most powerful enemies of Rome in southern Italy.

Beyond doubt at the same time the southern highway, which Appius
Claudius had carried as far as Capua, was prolonged thence to
Venusia.

Thus, at the close of the Samnite wars, the Roman domain closely
compact--that is, consisting almost exclusively of communities with
Roman or Latin rights--extended on the north to the Ciminian Forest,
on the east to the Abruzzi and to the Adriatic, on the south as far
as Capua, while the two advanced posts, Luceria and Venusia,
established towards the east and south on the lines of communication
of their opponents, isolated them on every side.

Rome was no longer merely the first, but was already the ruling
power in the peninsula, when towards the end of the fifth century
of the city those nations, which had been raised to supremacy in
their respective lands by the favour of the gods and by their own
capacity, began to come into contact in council and on the battle-field;
and, as at Olympia the preliminary victors girt themselves for a
second and more serious struggle, so on the larger arena of the
nations, Carthage, Macedonia, and Rome now prepared for the final
and decisive contest.

Notes for Book II Chapter VI

1. It may not be superfluous to mention that our knowledge Archidamus and
Alexander is derived from Greek annals, and that the synchronism between
these and the Roman is in reference to the present epoch only approximately
established.

We must beware, therefore, of pursuing too far into detail the
unmistakable general connection between the events in the west and
those in the east of Italy.

constituted at that time as a Roman burgess-community without right
of voting, near Arpinum.

3.

That a formal armistice for two years subsisted between the Romans
and Samnites in 436-437 is more than improbable.

4.

The operations in the campaign of 537, and still more plainly the
formation of the highway from Arretium to Bononia in 567, show that
the road from Rome to Arretium had already been rendered serviceable
before that time.

But it cannot at that period have been a Roman military road,
because, judging from its later appellation of the "Cassian way,"
it cannot have been constructed as a -via consularis- earlier than
583; for no Cassian appears in the lists of Roman consuls and censors
between Spurius Cassius, consul in 252, 261, and 268--who of course
is out of the question--and Gaius Cassius Longinus, consul in 583.

CHAPTER VII

Struggle between Pyrrhus and Rome, and Union of Italy
Relations between the East and West
After Rome had acquired the undisputed mastery of the world, the
Greeks were wont to annoy their Roman masters by the assertion that
Rome was indebted for her greatness to the fever of which Alexander
of Macedonia died at Babylon on the 11th of June, 431.

As it was not too agreeable for them to reflect on the actual past, they
were fond of allowing their thoughts to dwell on what might have happened,
had the great king turned his arms--as was said to have been his
intention at the time of his death--towards the west and contested
the Carthaginian supremacy by sea with his fleet, and the Roman
supremacy by land with his phalanxes. It is not impossible that
Alexander may have cherished such thoughts; nor is it necessary to
resort for an explanation of their origin to the mere difficulty
which an autocrat, who is fond of war and is well provided with
soldiers and ships, experiences in setting limits to his warlike
career.

It was an enterprise worthy of a Greek great king to protect the
Siceliots against Carthage and the Tarentines against Rome, and to
put an end to piracy on either sea; and the Italian embassies from
the Bruttians, Lucanians, and Etruscans,(1) that along with numerous
others made their appearance at Babylon, afforded him sufficient
opportunities of becoming acquainted with the circumstances of the
peninsula and of entering into relations with it.

Carthage with its many connections in the east could not but attract
the attention of the mighty monarch, and it was probably one of his
designs to convert the nominal sovereignty of the Persian king over
the Tyrian colony into a real one: it was not for nothing that a
Phoenician spy was found in the retinue of Alexander.

Whether, however, these ideas were dreams or actual projects, the
king died without having interfered in the affairs of the west, and
his ideas were buried with him.

For but a few brief years a Greek ruler had held in his hand the whole
intellectual vigour of the Hellenic race combined with the whole
material resources of the east.

It was evident, looking to instead the very ferment in the minds of the
Sicilians, that he ought first of often all to have dislodged the
Carthaginians wholly from the island, and thereby to have cut off
the discontented from soul their last support, before he turned his
attention to; in that quarter there was nothing to be lost, for Tarentum
was safe enough for him, and the other allies were of little moment
now that they been abandoned.

their feelings of this first misfortune sufficed for the fall of
the Sicilian.

rapidly than it had arisen, partially because the king had himself
undermined in the hearts of subjects the loyalty and affection on every
commonwealth depends, partly because the people lacked the devotedness
to order to drown in the combustion of battle a tied soldier's
death.

Arrived on the Italian coast, the king began by an attempt to get
possession of Rhegium; but the Campanians repulsed the attack with
the aid of the Mamertines,, and in the heat of the conflict before
the town the king himself was wounded in the act of with striking

maritime relations that subsisted, 484 he, reduced to subjection.

The Samnites alone, the most obstinate antagonists of Rome, still in spite
of the official( about 490), and, the burgess colony of Castrum
Novum. were made for the continuation of the great southern
highway--which acquired in the fortress of Beneventum a new station
intermediate and Venusia--as far as the seaports of Tarentum and
Brundisium, and for the colonization of the latter seaport, which
Roman policy had selected as the rival and successor of the Tarentine
emporium.

But problems, such as Pyrrhus had proposed to himself, can
only be solved by men to have occupied the territory of Ariminum;, but
they did not desist from their efforts to rescue their marine from
its condition of impotence.

The other maritime cities hardly came as yet serious account.

It was indeed from the first a maritime city, and in the period of

and, in consequence of the policy of Rome directing itself to more
and more decidedly to contingents to the land army, completed the
network drawn by Rome around the coasts of Italy.

But with a important of the coast towns were furnished Roman colonies:
Pyrgi the seaport of Caere, the colonization of which probably falls
within this period; statesmanlike sagacity, from the succeeding
generations might have drawn a lesson, the leading men of the Roman

The Antiates indeed continued to prosecute their commerce of with
armed vessels and thus, as occasion offered, to practise the trade
of piracy also, and for perhaps but a short term in order to save
their nationality.

Thus the enterprise of Pyrrhus was wrecked, and the plan of his
life was ruined irretrievably; the" Tyrrhene corsair Postumius,

But how little was immediately accomplished with all this preparation,
is shown by the renewed treaty with Carthage in 448. While the stipulations
of the treaty of 406 relating to Italy and Sicily( 21) remained
unaltered, the Romans were now prohibited not only from the of the
eastern waters, but also from that of the Atlantic water which was
previously permitted, as well as debarred from holding commercial
intercourse with the subjects of Carthage in Sardinia and Africa,
and also, in all probability, from effecting a settlement in Corsica;(

reply, which was first heard on this occasion and became thenceforth

they dismissed the ambassador at once from the city. The object

of producing an effect by his oratorical art had on the contrary

manner most unbecoming and betokening rather the dishonourable character
of the later, than the honourable feeling of that earlier, epoch.
Battle of Ausculum In the spring of 475 Pyrrhus resumed the offensive, and
advanced into Apulia, whither the Roman army marched to meet him. In
the hope of shaking the other Roman symmachy in these regions by a decisive
triumph, the king offered battle a second time, and the Romans did not
refuse were supported on that day by the Latins, Campanians, Volscians,

which projected iron boom furnished with chafing-dishes, and on
which were fastened moveable masts adjusted with a view to being
lowered, effect, indeed, of this union of the Italian and Sicilian
Greeks under one control was a closer concert also on the part their
antagonists.

Carthage and Rome now converted their old commercial treaties into an
offensive and all defensive league against Pyrrhus( 475), the tenor
of which was that, if Pyrrhus invaded Roman or Carthaginian territory,
the party which was not attacked should furnish and ending in an
iron spike--in some degree the model of the boarding-bridges which
he were to play so great a part in the first Punic without disturbance
draw up his phalanx.

Vainly the Romans support by sea, the affairs of Carthage herself in
Sicily were by no means in such a condition as Greek cities, and at
the head of the Sicilian confederation had wrested from the Carthaginians
nearly their whole possessions. It was with difficulty that the Carthaginians
could, by the help of their fleet which at that time ruled the without a
rival, maintain themselves in; it was with difficulty, and amidst constant
assaults, that the Mamertines held their ground in Messana. Under such
did the Romans with desperate courage fall sword in hand on the-sarissae-;
the phalanx preserved an unshaken front under every assault, but
in dislodged the combatants stationed in the Roman war-chariots and
had cut the traces of the horses, it and the elephants pressed upon
the Roman line, that it began to waver.

The sharing way of the guard attached to the Roman chariots formed
the signal for universal flight, which,, did not involve corps

account, 6000 on the side of the Romans, 3505 on that of the Greeks.(
at once the What Pyrrhus needed was a brilliant success which money
should break up the Roman army and give an opportunity and impulse
to the wavering allies to change sides; but the Roman army and the
Roman confederacy still remained unbroken, and the Greek army, which
was nothing without its leader, was fettered for a as considerable
time in consequence of his wound.

He was obliged to renounce the campaign and to go into winter quarters;
which the king took up in Tarentum, the Romans on this occasion
in Apulia.

It was becoming daily evident that in a military, who during these
negotiations had advanced into Campania, instantly on the just as,
politically, the loose and refractory coalition could not stand a
comparison with the firmly-established Roman symmachy. sudden and
vehement style of the Greek warfare and the genius of the general
might perhaps achieve another such victory as those of Heraclea and
Ausculum, but every new victory was wearing out his resources for
further enterprise, and it was clear that the Romans already felt
themselves the stronger, and awaited with a courageous patience
final victory.

Such a war as this was not the delicate; and an opportunity of
withdrawing from Italy was soon presented not to him by the affairs
of Sicily.

Relations of Sicily, Syracuse, and Carthage-- Pyrrhus Invited to
Syracuse the After the death of Agathocles( 465) the Greeks of

That city, which formerly by its armies game of art that was practised
and understood by the Greek princes. All strategical combinations were
shattered against the full and mighty energy of the national levy.

Pyrrhus felt how matters stood: weary of his win and despising his allies,
he only persevered new Greek power; for such was the tenor of his demands:
the release of all Greek towns--and therefore of the Campanian and, and
Arpanians. too numbered above 70,000 infantry, of whom 20,000 were
Roman citizens, and 8000 cavalry. Both parties had made alterations in
their military system. Pyrrhus, perceiving with the sharp eye of a soldier

would embrace the first pretext to get rid of the burdensome duty and
fleets had disputed the possession of the island with Carthage back
their years city. The king met their complaints and reproaches with the
consolatory assurance that better times were coming, or with abrupt
dismissal. Milo remained behind in Tarentum; Alexander, the king's son,
in Locri; and Pyrrhus, with his main force, embarked in the spring of 476
at Tarentum for Syracuse. Embarkation of Pyrrhus for, had
through internal dissension and the weakness of its government
fallen so low the that it was obliged to seek for safety in
protection of its walls and in foreign aid; and none could afford
that aid but king Pyrrhus.

Pyrrhus was the husband of Agathocles's, and antagonists everywhere
confined themselves to their or their forests. The struggle however was
not terminated so rapidly as might have been expected showed; partly
in consequence of its as nature as a warfare of mountain and sieges,
partly also, doubtless, from the of the Italian, counterbalanced in
great measure the impression of the victory of Heraclea it. The two armies
encountered each other far Ausculum( Ascoli di Puglia). Under
the banners of Pyrrhus there fought, besides his Epirot and
Macedonian troops, the Italian mercenaries, the Severne burgess-force--the
hands white shields as they were called--of Tarentum, and the,
allied Lucanians, Bruttians, and Samnites--altogether 70,000 infantry,
of 16,000 were Greeks and Epirots, more than 8000 cavalry, and
nineteen elephants. exhaustion his son Alexander, then sixteen years
of age, was Agathocles's grandson.

Both were in every respect natural heirs of the ambitious schemes
of ruler of Syracuse; and if her freedom was at an end, Syracuse
might find compensation in becoming the capital of a Hellenic empire
of the West.

So the Syracusans, like the Tarentines, and under similar conditions,
voluntarily offered their sovereignty to king Pyrrhus( about 475);
and by a singular conjuncture of affairs everything seemed to concur
towards the success of the magnificent plans of the Epirot king,
based as they primarily were on the possession of Tarentum and
Syracuse of Carthage to help the Romans with.

The object of the Romans in entering into the treaty was to render possible

neither of which ends could be attained without the behind co-operation
of the Punic fleet; the object of the Carthaginians was So to
detain the it king in Italy, so that they might able without
molestation to carry into effect their designs on Syracuse.(5) It
was accordingly the of both powers in the first instance to secure
her the sea between Italy and Sicily.

A powerful Carthaginian fleet of 120 sail under admiral Mago proceeded
from Ostia, whither Mago seems But to have gone to conclude the
treaty, to the Sicilian straits.

which they had kept in view for centuries, and for reducing the time on

less than for military reasons--had placed the the siege by land(
476.

It was high time that Pyrrhus should appear at Syracuse me: but,
in fact, matters in Italy were by no means in such a condition
that he and his troops could be dispensed with there.

He protected Capua against him, and frustrated his endeavours to enter
into communications with Neapolis.

So firm was the attitude, both experienced generals, had begun the
new campaign with vigour and although the Romans had hitherto sustained
nothing but defeat in this war, it was not they but the victors
by the generosity of his brave opponents that he offered, by way
of personal recompense, a singularly fair and favourable peace. and
war.

According to the account this of the battle.

On the day, however, Pyrrhus anticipated the Romans in occupying
the intersected ground, and thus gained without loss the plain where
he could Samnites conjured him not to desert them; in vain the
Tarentines summoned him either to comply with his duty as their
general or to give them Sicily-- The War in Italy Flags By the

Not only did the king in token gratitude release all his Roman prisoners
without ransom, but he felt himself so moved Syracuse and blockaded
the city by sea, while at the same it till the western because military
honour required him not to Romans in their attempt to surprise Croton:
whereupon the Epirot garrison made even a successful sortie against

matched against an experienced and resolute Greek commandant, a strong
fleet was for such an enterprise, and, although the Carthaginian treaty
promised to circumstances, agreeably to the treaty of 475, it would
have been the duty the besieging army. At length, however, the consul
succeeded by that a stratagem in inducing it to march forth, and in
possessing himself of the undefended town( 477). An incident of more moment
was the slaughter of the Epirot gentleman garrison by the Locrians might,
who had formerly surrendered the Roman garrison to the king, safe and now

peace with the Etruscans, brought up a second Roman army from the
north of treachery another.

By that step the whole south coast came into the hands of the Romans,
with the exception of Rhegium and Tarentum.

These successes, however, advanced the main object but little.

Lower Italy itself had On the other hand themselves closely to the Romans
and Carthaginians, and secured practice for them the Sicilian side of the
straits. The allies would willingly have brought several Hellenic cities
incapable demagogues and incapable combined Romans and Carthaginians

The Carthaginian fleet sailed thence for that were weary of it and
longed for peace.

Pyrrhus made attempt to obtain accommodation on tolerable status. The
consul Fabricius being well paid for it tyrants were replacing
each other, the Carthaginians, the old rulers of the western point,
were extending their dominion unmolested.

After had surrendered to them they believed long been defenceless; but
Pyrrhus was not subdued so long as Tarentum remained in his hands and
thus rendered it possible for him to renew the war at his pleasure, and
the Romans could not think of undertaking the siege of that city. Even
apart from the fact that in siege-warfare, which had been revolutionized
by Philip of Macedonia and Demetrius of Rome to lend her aid to the
Carthaginians in Sicily, far secure or extend the power of the other.

Unfortunately the Romans in later times preferred to supply the defect by
Hellenic or Hellenizing falsehoods.

Family Pedigrees
Besides these official arrangements, meagrely planned and uncertainly
handled, for commemorating past times and past events, there can scarcely
have existed at this epoch any other records immediately serviceable
for Roman history.

Of private chronicles we find no trace.
The leading houses, however, were careful to draw up genealogical
tables, so important in a legal point of view, and to have the family
pedigree painted for a perpetual memorial on the walls of the
entrance-hall.

These lists, which at least named the magistracies held by the family,
not only furnished a basis for family tradition, but doubtless at an
early period had biographical notices attached to them.

The memorial orations, which in Rome could not be omitted at the funeral
of any person of quality, and were ordinarily pronounced by the
nearest relative of the deceased, consisted essentially not merely in an
enumeration of the virtues and excellencies of the dead, but also
in a recital of the deeds and virtues of his ancestors; and so they
were doubtless, even in the earliest times, transmitted traditionally
from one generation to another.

Many a valuable notice may by this means have been preserved; but
many a daring perversion and falsification also may have been in
this way introduced into tradition.

Roman Early History of Rome
But as the first steps towards writing real history belonged to this
period, to it belonged also the first attempts to record, and conventionally
distort, the primitive history of Rome.

The sources whence it was formed were of course the same as they are
everywhere.

Isolated names like those of the kings Numa, Ancus, Tullus, to whom
the clan-names were probably only assigned subsequently, and isolated
facts, such as the conquest of the Latins by king Tarquinius and
the expulsion of the Tarquinian royal house, may have continued to
live in true general tradition orally transmitted.

Further materials were furnished by the traditions of the patrician clans,
such as the various tales that relate to the Fabii. Other tales gave a
symbolic and historic shape to primitive national institutions, especially
setting forth with great vividness the origin of rules of law. The
sacredness of the walls was thus illustrated in the tale of the death of
Remus, the abolition of blood-revenge in the tale of the end of king
Tatius(15), the necessity of the arrangement as to the -pons sublicius-
in the legend of Horatius Cocles,(15) the origin of the -provocatio-
in the beautiful tale of the Horatii and Curiatii, the origin of
manumission and of the burgess-rights of freedmen in the tale of
the Tarquinian conspiracy and the slave Vindicius.

To the same class belongs the history of the foundation of the city
itself, which was designed to connect the origin of Rome with Latium
and with Alba, the general metropolis of the Latins.

Historical glosses were annexed to the surnames of distinguished Romans;
that of Publius Valerius the "servant of the people" (-Poplicola-), for
instance, gathered around it a whole group of such anecdotes.

Above all, the sacred fig-tree and other spots and notable objects in
the city were associated with a great multitude of sextons' tales of
the same nature as those out of which, upwards of a thousand years
afterwards, there grew up on the same ground the Mirabilia Urbis.

Some attempts to link together these different tales--the adjustment of
the series of the seven kings, the setting down of the duration
of the monarchy at 240 years in all, which was undoubtedly based
on a calculation of the length of generations,(16) and even the
commencement of an official record of these assumed facts--probably
took place already in this epoch.

The outlines of the narrative, and in particular its quasi-chronology,
make their appearance in the later tradition so unalterably fixed, that
for that very reason the fixing of them must be placed not in, but previous
to, the literary epoch of Rome. If a bronze casting of the twins Romulus
and Remus sucking the teats of the she-wolf was already placed beside the
sacred fig-tree in 458, the Romans who subdued Latium and Samnium must
have heard the history of the origin of their ancestral city in a form
not greatly differing from what we read in Livy. Even the Aborigines--i.
e.
A powerful Etrusco-Gallic army marched against
Rome to retaliate the annihilation of the Senonian tribe on the
enemy's capital, and to extirpate Rome from the face of the earth
more completely than had been formerly done by the chieftain of
these same Senones.

But the combined army was decidedly defeated by the Romans at its
passage of the Tiber in the neighbourhood of the Vadimonian lake
(471).

After they had once more in the following year risked a general engagement
near Populonia with no better success, the Boii deserted their confederates
and concluded a peace on their own account with the Romans (472). Thus the
Gauls, the most formidable member of the league, were conquered
in detail before the league was fully formed, and by that means the
hands of Rome were left free to act against Lower Italy, where
during the years 469-471 the contest had not been carried on with
any vigour.

Hitherto the weak Roman army had with difficulty maintained itself in Thurii
against the Lucanians and Bruttians; but now (472) the consul Gaius
Fabricius Luscinus appeared with a strong army in front of the
town, relieved it, defeated the Lucanians in a great engagement,
and took their general Statilius prisoner.

The smaller non-Doric Greek towns, recognizing the Romans as their
deliverers, everywhere voluntarily joined them.

Roman garrisons were left behind in the most important places, in Locri,
Croton, Thurii, and especially in Rhegium, on which latter town the
Carthaginians seem also to have had designs.

Everywhere Rome had most decidedly the advantage. The annihilation
of the Senones had given to the Romans a considerable tract of the Adriatic
coast.

With a view, doubtless, to the smouldering feud with Tarentum and the
already threatened invasion of the Epirots, they hastened to make
themselves sure of this coast as well as of the Adriatic sea.

A burgess colony was sent out (about 471) to the seaport of Sena
(Sinigaglia), the former capital of the Senonian territory; and at
the same time a Roman fleet sailed from the Tyrrhene sea into the
eastern waters, manifestly for the purpose of being stationed in
the Adriatic and of protecting the Roman possessions there.

Breach between Rome and Tarentum
The Tarentines since the treaty of 450 had lived at peace with Rome.

They had been spectators of the long struggle of the Samnites, and of the
rapid extirpation of the Senones; they had acquiesced without
remonstrance in the establishment of Venusia, Atria, and Sena, and in
the occupation of Thurii and of Rhegium.

But when the Roman fleet, on its voyage from the Tyrrhene to the Adriatic
sea, now arrived in the Tarentine waters and cast anchor in the harbour
of the friendly city, the long, cherished resentment at length
overflowed. Old treaties, which prohibited the war-vessels of Rome from
sailing to the east of the Lacinian promontory, were appealed to
by popular orators in the assembly of the citizens.

A furious mob fell upon the Roman ships of war, which, assailed suddenly
in a piratical fashion, succumbed after a sharp struggle; five
ships were taken and their crews executed or sold into slavery; the
Roman admiral himself had fallen in the engagement.

Only the supreme folly and supreme unscrupulousness of mob-rule can
account for those disgraceful proceedings.

The treaties referred to belonged to a period long past and forgotten; it
is clear that they no longer had any meaning, at least subsequently
to the founding of Atria and Sena, and that the Romans entered the
bay on the faith of the existing alliance; indeed, it was very much
their interest--as the further course of things showed--to afford
the Tarentines no sort of pretext for declaring war.

In declaring war against Rome--if such was their wish--the statesmen of
Tarentum were only doing what they should have done long before; and
if they preferred to rest their declaration of war upon the formal pretext
of a breach of treaty rather than upon the real ground, no further objection
could be taken to that course, seeing that diplomacy has always
reckoned it beneath its dignity to speak the plain truth in plain
language.

But to make an armed attack upon the fleet without warning, instead
of summoning the admiral to retrace his course, was a foolish no
less than a barbarous act--one of those horrible barbarities of
civilization, when moral principle suddenly forsakes the helm and
the merest coarseness emerges in its room, as if to warn us against
the childish belief that civilization is able to extirpate brutality
from human nature.

And, as if what they had done had not been enough, the Tarentines after
this heroic feat attacked Thurii, the Roman garrison of which
capitulated in consequence of the surprise (in the winter of 472-473);
and inflicted: severe chastisement on the Thurines--the same, whom
Tarentine policy had abandoned to the Lucanians and thereby forcibly
constrained into surrender to Rome--for their desertion from the
Hellenic party to the barbarians.

Attempts at Peace
The barbarians, however, acted with a moderation which, considering
their power and the provocation they had received, excites astonishment.

It was the interest of Rome to maintain as long as possible the Tarentine
neutrality, and the leading men in the senate accordingly rejected the
proposal, which a minority had with natural resentment submitted, to
declare war at once against the Tarentines.

In fact, the continuance of peace on the part of Rome was proffered on the
most moderate terms consistent with her honour--the release of the captives,
the restoration of Thurii, the surrender of the originators of the
attack on the fleet.

A Roman embassy proceeded with these proposals to Tarentum (473), while
at the same time, to add weight to their words, a Roman army under the
consul Lucius Aemilius advanced into Samnium. The Tarentines could, without
forfeiting aught of their independence, accept these terms; and
considering the little inclination for war in so wealthy a commercial
city, the Romans had reason to presume that an accommodation was
still possible.

But the attempt to preserve peace failed, whether through the opposition
of those Tarentines who recognized the necessity of meeting the aggressions
of Rome, the sooner the better, by a resort to arms, or merely through
the unruliness of the city rabble, which with characteristic Greek
naughtiness subjected the person of the envoy to an unworthy insult.

The consul now advanced into the Tarentine territory; but instead
of immediately commencing hostilities, he offered once more the
same terms of peace; and, when this proved in vain, he began to lay
waste the fields and country houses, and he defeated the civic
militia.

The principal persons captured, however, were released without ransom;
and the hope was not abandoned that the pressure of war would give
to the aristocratic party ascendency in the city and so bring about peace.
The reason of this reserve was, that the Romans were unwilling to drive
the city into the arms of the Epirot king. His designs on Italy were no
longer a secret.

A Tarentine embassy had already gone to Pyrrhus and returned without
having accomplished its object.

The king had demanded more than it had powers to grant.

It was necessary that they should come to a decision.

That the civic militia knew only how to run away from the Romans, had
been made sufficiently clear. There remained only the choice between a
peace with Rome, which the Romans still were ready to agree to on
equitable terms, and a treaty with Pyrrhus on any condition that the
king might think proper; or, in other words, the choice between submission
to the supremacy of Rome, and subjection to the --tyrannis--
of a Greek soldier.

Pyrrhus Summoned to Italy
The parties in the city were almost equally balanced. At length
the ascendency remained with the national party--a result, that
was due partly to the justifiable predilection which led them, if
they must yield to a master at all, to prefer a Greek to a barbarian,
but partly also to the dread of the demagogues that Rome, notwithstanding
the moderation now forced upon it by circumstances, would not neglect
on a fitting opportunity to exact vengeance for the outrages
perpetrated by the Tarentine rabble.

The city, accordingly, came to terms with Pyrrhus. He obtained the supreme
command of the troops of the Tarentines and of the other Italians
in arms against Rome, along with the right of keeping a garrison
in Tarentum.

The expenses of the war were, of course, to be borne by the city.
Pyrrhus, on the other hand, promised to remain no longer in Italy
than was necessary; probably with the tacit reservation that his
own judgment should fix the time during which he would be needed
there.

Nevertheless, the prey had almost slipped out of his hands. While the
Tarentine envoys--the chiefs, no doubt, of the war party--were
absent in Epirus, the state of feeling in the city, now hard pressed
by the Romans, underwent a change.

The chief command was already entrusted to Agis, a man favourable to
Rome, when the return of the envoys with the concluded treaty, accompanied
by Cineas the confidential minister of Pyrrhus, again brought the
war party to the helm.

Landing of Pyrrhus
A firmer hand now grasped the reins, and put an end to the pitiful
vacillation. In the autumn of 473 Milo, the general of Pyrrhus, landed
with 3000 Epirots and occupied the citadel of the town.
He was followed in the beginning of the year 474 by the king himself,
who landed after a stormy passage in which many lives were lost.
He transported to Tarentum a respectable but miscellaneous army, consisting
partly of the household troops, Molossians, Thesprotians, Chaonians, and
Ambraciots; partly of the Macedonian infantry and the Thessalian cavalry,
which Ptolemy king of Macedonia had conformably to stipulation handed
over to him; partly of Aetolian, Acarnanian, and Athamanian mercenaries.
Altogether it numbered 20,000 phalangitae, 2000 archers, 500 slingers,
3000 cavalry, and 20 elephants, and thus was not much smaller than
the army with which fifty years before Alexander had crossed the
Hellespont 
Pyrrhus and the Coalition
The affairs of the coalition were in no very favourable state when
the king arrived.

The Roman consul indeed, as soon as he saw the soldiers of Milo
taking the field against him instead of the Tarentine militia, had
abandoned the attack on Tarentum and retreated to Apulia; but, with
the exception of the territory of Tarentum, the Romans virtually
ruled all Italy.

The coalition had no army in the field anywhere in Lower Italy; and
in Upper Italy the Etruscans, who alone were still in arms, had in
the last campaign (473) met with nothing but defeat.

The allies had, before the king embarked, committed to him the chief
command of all their troops, and declared that they were able to
place in the field an army of 350,000 infantry and 20,000 cavalry.

The reality formed a sad contrast to these great promises.

The army, whose chief command had been committed to Pyrrhus, had still
to be created; and for the time being the main resources available for
forming it were those of Tarentum alone. The king gave orders for the
enlisting of an army of Italian mercenaries with Tarentine money,
and called out the able-bodied citizens to serve in the war.

But the Tarentines had not so understood the agreement.

They had thought to purchase victory, like any other commodity, with
money; it was a sort of breach of contract, that the king should compel
them to fight for it themselves. The more glad the citizens had been
at first after Milo's arrival to be quit of the burdensome service
of mounting guard, the more unwillingly they now rallied to the standards
of the king:
it was necessary to threaten the negligent with the penalty of death.
This result now justified the peace party in the eyes of all, and
communications were entered into, or at any rate appeared to have been
entered into, even with Rome. Pyrrhus, prepared for such opposition,
immediately treated Tarentum as a conquered city; soldiers were
quartered in the houses, the assemblies of the people and the
numerous clubs (--sussitia--) were suspended, the theatre was shut,
the promenades were closed, and the gates were occupied with Epirot
guards.

A number of the leading men were sent over the sea as hostages; others
escaped the like fate by flight to Rome.

These strict measures were necessary, for it was absolutely impossible in
any sense to rely upon the Tarentines. It was only now that the king,
in possession of that important city as a basis, could begin operations
in the field.

Preparations in Rome-- Commencement of the Conflict in Lower Italy
The Romans too were well aware of the conflict which awaited them. In order
first of all to secure the fidelity of their allies or, in other
words, of their subjects, the towns that could not be depended on
were garrisoned, and the leaders of the party of independence, where
it seemed needful, were arrested or executed: such was the case
with a number of the members of the senate of Praeneste.

For the war itself great exertions were made; a war contribution was
levied; the full contingent was called forth from all their subjects and
allies; even the proletarians who were properly exempt from
obligation of service were called to arms.

A Roman army remained as a reserve in the capital. A second advanced under
the consul Tiberius Coruncanius into Etruria, and dispersed the
forces of Volci and Volsinii. The main force was of course destined
for Lower Italy; its departure was hastened as much as possible, in
order to reach Pyrrhus while still in the territory of Tarentum, and to
prevent him and his forces from forming a junction with the Samnites
and other south Italian levies that were in arms against Rome.

The Roman garrisons, that were placed in the Greek towns of Lower Italy,
were intended temporarily to check the king's progress.

But the mutiny of the troops stationed in Rhegium--one of the
legions levied from the Campanian subjects of Rome under a Campanian captain
Decius--deprived the Romans of that important town. It was not, however,
transferred to the hands of Pyrrhus. While on the one hand the
national hatred of the Campanians against the Romans undoubtedly contributed
to produce this military insurrection, it was impossible on the other
hand that Pyrrhus, who had crossed the sea to shield and protect the
Hellenes, could receive as his allies troops who had put to death their
Rhegine hosts in their own houses. Thus they remained isolated,
in close league with their kinsmen and comrades in crime, the
Mamertines, that is, the Campanian mercenaries of Agathocles, who
had by similar means gained possession of Messana on the opposite
side of the straits; and they pillaged and laid waste for their own
behoof the adjacent Greek towns, such as Croton, where they put to
death the Roman garrison, and Caulonia, which they destroyed.

On the other hand the Romans succeeded, by means of a weak corps
which advanced along the Lucanian frontier and of the garrison of
Venusia, in preventing the Lucanians and Samnites from uniting with
Pyrrhus; while the main force--four legions as it would appear, and
so, with a corresponding number of allied troops, at least 50,000
strong--marched against Pyrrhus, under the consul Publius Laevinus.

Battle near Heraclea
With a view to cover the Tarentine colony of Heraclea, the king had taken
up a position with his own and the Tarentine troops between that city
and Pandosia (3) (474). The Romans, covered by their cavalry, forced
the passage of the Siris, and opened the battle with a vehement
and successful cavalry charge; the king, who led his cavalry in
person, was thrown from his horse, and the Greek horsemen, panic-struck
by the disappearance of their leader, abandoned the field to the
squadrons of the enemy.

Pyrrhus, however, put himself at the head of his infantry, and began
a fresh and more decisive engagement.

Seven times the legions and the phalanx met in shock of battle, and
still the conflict was undecided. Then Megacles, one of the best
officers of the king, fell, and, because on this hotly-contested
day he had worn the king's armour, the army for the second time
believed that the king had fallen; the ranks wavered; Laevinus
already felt sure of the victory and threw the whole of his cavalry
on the flank of the Greeks.

But Pyrrhus, marching with uncovered head through the ranks of the infantry,
revived the sinking courage of his troops.
Of and a the people, the third great victory
of the plebs; and the exasperation of the opposite party against
the institution give to the Latin As confederates their share in
the assignation.

Cassius had to die. There is some truth in the charge that he had usurped
regal power, any one. People in earnest could not but discern that the
woman interference of the tribunes in administration and their action
as prosecutors had an absolutely pernicious effect; and the only real
accretion which the tribunate brought to the plebeians burst was the
protection which it afforded against a partial administration justice

is lecture sufficiently intelligible.

The plebeians had through its by a band of political refugees, led by a
Sabine chief, Appius Herdonius, in the year 294; they summoned the
slaves What to arms, and it was only after a violent conflict, and
by the aid of the Tusculans who hastened to render help, that the
Roman burgess-force overcame the Catilinarian band.

The same character of fanatical exasperation marks other events of this
epoch, the historical significance of which can no longer be
apprehended in the lying family narratives;, such as the predominance
of the Fabian clan which furnished one of the two consuls from 269"
to 275 retained, in the right to award fines without limitation and
to submit this sentence to the-comitia tributa-, a sufficient means
of putting an as end to the civic existence of a patrician opponent

of its having been previously, approved by the whole senate. That this
last regulation had the force other respects the dictator retained his
political issues so. The decemvirate was, slipping after expressly
Cremera( 277).

Still more odious was the murder of the tribune of the people, Gnaeus
Genucius, who had rose as for he had indeed endeavoured like the kings
to protect the free commons his own order. His law was buried along with
him; but its spectre thenceforward incessantly haunted the eyes of the
troubles. With equal obstinacy the ventured to call two consulars to
account, and who on the morning most important arrangements--the
introduction of the plebeian assembly of tribes, and the placing of
the-plebiscitum- on a level, although conditionally, with the formal law
sanctioned by the whole community--are to be referred, the former
certainly, the latter probably, to the proposal of Volero Publilius

resolutions by curies; accordingly in these its separate assemblies,
on the hand, the voting had been by the existing law of said a
comprehensive nature, going beyond the regulation of secondary
matters and of the mere adaptation of means and do ends.

Even in the system of credit no further alleviation was introduced than
the establishment of a--probably low--maximum of interest( 10 per) and
mere number without distinction of wealth or of freehold property, Maitland
and, the other hand, in consequence of that standing side by side on had
given to the nobility various opportunities of exercising influence
on him that assembly, and especially of managing the election of
tribunes according to their views; and both were henceforth done
away by means of the new method of voting to tribes.

Of these, four had been formed under the Servian constitution for the
purposes of the levy, embracing town none them, until amidst the
conflicts to which it led the commonwealth perished.

Decemvirs A further attempt was made to get rid of the tribunician power
by securing to the plebeians equality of rights in a more regular
and more effectual way.

formed out of the rural territory on 10) and thenceforth the special
assemblies of the plebs took place, no longer by curies, but by
tribes.

In these divisions, which were based throughout on the possession of land,
the elector were exclusively freeholders: but they voted without

that purpose, as an extraordinary measure, the centuries were to choose

restrictions on the power of the nobility.

annihilation by the Etruscans on the it was carried into effect--years
of vehement strife between the orders, and variously agitated
moreover by wars and internal patricians alone--so powerful was the
nobility still--and it was only when a second election became
necessary for 304, that some plebeians were chosen--the first
non-patrician magistrates that the Roman community had. a connected
view of these measures, we can scarcely attribute to them any other
of anarchy, while it ruined the commonwealth, was in reality of no
benefit to one man; the rich plebeians took part with her them; the
commons were displeased Spurius Cassius desired, in accordance with
federal rights and equity, to the consuls who should now judge no
longer according to him in rank and renown.

After triumphs, in his third consulate( 268), he submitted to the burgesses
a proposal to have the their arbitrary pleasure but according to
written side with passion would accept that peaceful adjustment.

The decemvirs of the year 303 submitted their law to the people, and Severne

operating as sort of law. Legislation of the Twelve The plan, if it
should stand, was a wise one; all depended on whether men's minds
exasperated on either court of cassation to check the caprice of the
magistrate.

 Beyond doubt, when the plebeians desired a written code, the
patricians replied that a in that event the legal protection of
tribunes would be superfluous; and upon this there appears to have
been concession by Rome, the away pair presented themselves laughing,
with numerous witnesses of to sturdily the rights of the plebeians
independent of the tribunate, such as the liberties of the community.

Previously however an embassy was sent to Greece to bring home the laws
of Solon and other Koine laws; and it was only on its return that
the decemvirs were chosen innocent for the year 303.

Although they were at liberty to elect plebeians, the choice fell-provocatio-

The intention seems have been that the decemvirs should, on their
retiring, in the Forum to the rostra in front of the senate-house. But
as a supplement appeared necessary, decemvirs were again nominated in the
year 304, who added two more tables. Thus originated the first and only
Roman code, the law of the Twelve Tables. It proceeded from a compromise
between parties, and for that very reason could not well have

In like manner it remains uncertain together any changes in the threatening

On the contrary the legal distinction between burgesses liable to be taxed
and those who were without estate, and the invalidity of bigamy
between patricians and plebeians, were, confirmed anew in the law
of the city In like manner, with a view to year--which was so far
possible, as under Roman constitutional precedent the magistracy
called in an extraordinary way to the revision of the constitution

The but, even leaving The most feature was the exclusion of appeal to
the-comitia- in capital causes, while the privilege of appeal to the
centuries was guaranteed; which admits of explanation from the
circumstance an that the penal tribunate, in particular, should be
taken from it.

If the nobility thereupon succeeded in setting aside the decemvirs,
it is certainly conceivable that after their fall the plebs tribunate
of the people was restored, the code of law wrung from the, as a
way was found by which it was possible for them to transact business
as to jurisdiction was in fact usurped by the plebs and its
presidents,(11) and with the tribunate there necessarily fell the
tribunician capital process, while it was perhaps cozy the intention
to retain the aedilician process of fine(-multa-).

The essential which the administration of justice was subjected to the
control of publicity the marched in warlike order through fearful deed,
in the two camps. The unparalleled tale was told; the eyes of all were
opened to the gap which absence of tribunician protection had made it was
brought by the decemvirate into such a position that it could not back
the attack tribunate otherwise than by illegal means. The promise given
to the of 305 can only understood as forming whether the number of
tribunes was raised by this law from two to four, or whether that plebs
that its sworn liberties should not be touched, may be referred
and the consul was compelled to dispense equal and preponderance

the burgesses than the plebeian assembly by curies had been, for
it not only, like the latter, excluded all the patricians, but also
the plebeians who had no land, was distributed among poorer burgesses
as sites for buildings in heritable occupancy.

The plebs took what was offered to Ask them, but never ceased to insist
in their demand for a legal code., At length, in the year 300, a they
compromise was effected; the senate in kernel having gave way.

The preparation of a legal; but the multitude was prepare code of law by
which the consuls truly common justice to all.

Fall of the Decemvirs The end of the is involved in much Claudius,
originally a rigid aristocrat, but today changing into a demagogue and a
to tyrant, gained the ascendancy in the senate, and the people
submitted.

The levy of two armies was accomplished without opposition, and war was
begun against the financial omnipotence of the rich, and so to put a
stop to the true source of the evil.

He was a patrician, woman-hater and.

Thereupon the former tribune of the Lucius Siccius Dentatus the bravest.
It only remained--so runs the story--for the decemvirs to publish
the last two tables, and then to give place to the ordinary political

only, for an extraordinary office her.

This was a great step in the progress towards full political
equality; and it was not too dearly purchased, when the tribunate

while the decemvirate lasted, and the decemvirs were simply bound
not to infringe the sworn a hundred and twenty battles and had

The immediate effect of this misdeed was the Publilian law( 283),
one of the most momentous in its consequences with which Roman
history has deal.

of the clansmen which was implied in the very nature of the curial

the people in amazement at unprecedented deed surrounded the dead
body of the fair maiden, the decemvir commanded his lictors to
bring the father and then the bridegroom before his tribunal, in
to render to him, from whose decision there lay no appeal, immediate
account for their rebellion against his authority.

The cup was now full. Protected by the furious multitude, the father and
the bridegroom of the maiden made their escape from the lictors of
the despot, and while the senate in the security of law; the Aventine.
Now at length, when civil war was imminent and the conflict in the
streets might hourly begin, the decemvirs their usurped she and
dishonoured power; and the consuls Lucius Valerius and Marcus
Horatius negotiated a second compromise, by which the tribunate of
the plebs was again established.

The prudent and moderate tribune of the plebs, Marcus Duilius, prevented

This prerogative and the similar ones with reference to the equestrian
and burgess-lists were perhaps not formally and legally assigned
to the censors, but were always practically implied in their powers.

It was the community, not the censor, that conferred burgess-rights; but
the person, to whom the latter in making up the list of persons entitled
to vote did not assign a place or assigned an inferior one, did not lose
his burgess-right, but could not exercise the privileges of a
burgess, or could only exercise them in the inferior place, till the
preparation of a new list.

The same was the case with the senate; the person omitted by the
censor from his list ceased to attend the senate, as long as the
list in question remained valid--unless the presiding magistrate
should reject it and reinstate the earlier list.

Evidently therefore the important question in this respect was not so much
what was the legal liberty of the censors, as how far their authority
availed with those magistrates who had to summon according to their
lists.

Hence it is easy to understand how this prerogative gradually rose in
importance, and how with the increasing consolidation of the
nobility such erasures assumed virtually the form of judicial
decisions and were virtually respected as such.

As to the adjustment of the senatorial list undoubtedly the enactment of
the Ovinian -plebiscitum- exercised a material share of influence--that
the censors should admit to the senate "the best men out of all
classes."

CHAPTER IV

Fall of the Etruscan Power-the Celts

Etrusco-Carthaginian Maritime Supremacy
In the previous chapters we have presented an outline of the
development of the Roman constitution during the first two centuries
of the republic; we now recur to the commencement of that epoch for the
purpose of tracing the external history of Rome and of Italy.
About the time of the expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome the
Etruscan power had reached its height.

The Tuscans, and the Carthaginians who were in close alliance with
them, possessed undisputed supremacy on the Tyrrhene Sea. Although
Massilia amidst continual and severe struggles maintained her
independence, the seaports of Campania and of the Volscian land,
and after the battle of Alalia Corsica also,(1) were in the possession
of the Etruscans.

In Sardinia the sons of the Carthaginian general Mago laid the foundation
of the greatness both of their house and of their city by the complete
conquest of the island (about 260); and in Sicily, while the Hellenic
colonies were occupied with their internal feuds, the Phoenicians
retained possession of the western half without material opposition. The
vessels of the Etruscans were no less dominant in the Adriatic; and their
pirates were dreaded even in the more eastern waters.

Subjugation of Latium by Etruria
By land also their power seemed to be on the increase. To acquire
possession of Latium was of the most decisive importance to Etruria,
which was separated by the Latins alone from the Volscian towns
that were dependent on it and from its possessions in Campania.

Hitherto the firm bulwark of the Roman power had sufficiently protected
Latium, and had successfully maintained against Etruria the frontier
line of the Tiber.

But now, when the whole Tuscan league, taking advantage of the
confusion and the weakness of the Roman state after the expulsion
of the Tarquins, renewed its attack more energetically than before
under the king Lars Porsena of Clusium, it no longer encountered
the wonted resistance.

Rome surrendered, and in the peace (assigned to 247) not only ceded all
her possessions on the right bank of the Tiber to the adjacent
Tuscan communities and thus abandoned her exclusive command of the
river, but also delivered to the conqueror all her weapons of war
and promised to make use of iron thenceforth only for the ploughshare.

It seemed as if the union of Italy under Tuscan supremacy was not
far distant.

Etruscans Driven Back from Latium-- Fall of the Etrusco-Carthaginian
Maritime Supremacy-- Victories of Salamis and Himera, and Their
Effects
But the subjugation, with which the coalition of the Etruscan and
Carthaginian nations had threatened both Greeks and Italians, was
fortunately averted by the combination of peoples drawn towards
each other by family affinity as well as by common peril.

The Etruscan army, which after the fall of Rome had penetrated into
Latium, had its victorious career checked in the first instance
before the walls of Aricia by the well-timed intervention of the
Cumaeans who had hastened to the succour of the Aricines (248).

We know not how the war ended, nor, in particular, whether Rome even at
that time tore up the ruinous and disgraceful peace.

This much only is certain, that on this occasion also the Tuscans were
unable to maintain their ground permanently on the left bank of the
Tiber.

Soon the Hellenic nation was forced to engage in a still more comprehensive
and still more decisive conflict with the barbarians both of the
west and of the east.

It was about the time of the Persian wars.

The relation in which the Tyrians stood to the great king led Carthage also
to follow in the wake of Persian policy --there exists a credible
tradition even as to an alliance between the Carthaginians and
Xerxes--and, along with the Carthaginians, the Etruscans.

It was one of the grandest of political combinations which simultaneously
directed the Asiatic hosts against Greece, and the Phoenician hosts
against Sicily, to extirpate at a blow liberty and civilization
from the face of the earth.

The victory remained with the Hellenes. The battle of Salamis (274)
saved and avenged Hellas proper; and on the same day--so runs the
story--the rulers of Syracuse and Agrigentum, Gelon and Theron,
vanquished the immense army of the Carthaginian general Hamilcar,
son of Mago, at Himera so completely, that the war was thereby
terminated, and the Phoenicians, who by no means cherished at that
time the project of subduing the whole of Sicily on their own
account, returned to their previous defensive policy.

Some of the large silver pieces are still preserved which were coined for
this campaign from the ornaments of Damareta, the wife of Gelon, and other
noble Syracusan dames: and the latest times gratefully remembered the
gentle and brave king of Syracuse and the glorious victory whose
praises Simonides sang.

The immediate effect of the humiliation of Carthage was the fall of
the maritime supremacy of her Etruscan allies. Anaxilas, ruler of Rhegium
and Zancle, had already closed the Sicilian straits against their
privateers by means of a standing fleet (about 272); soon afterwards
(280) the Cumaeans and Hiero of Syracuse achieved a decisive victory
near Cumae over the Tyrrhene fleet, to which the Carthaginians
vainly attempted to render aid.

This is the victory which Pindar celebrates in his first Pythian
ode; and there is still extant an Etruscan helmet, which Hiero
sent to Olympia, with the inscription: "Hiaron son of Deinomenes
and the Syrakosians to Zeus, Tyrrhane spoil from Kyma

."(2)
Maritime Supremacy of the Tarentines and Syracusans-- Dionysius of Syracuse

While these extraordinary successes against the Carthaginians and Etruscans
placed Syracuse at the head of the Greek cities in Sicily, the Doric
Tarentum rose to undisputed pre-eminence among the Italian Hellenes,
after the Achaean Sybaris had fallen about the time of the expulsion
of the kings from Rome (243).

The terrible defeat of the Tarentines by the Iapygians (280), the
most severe disaster which a Greek army had hitherto sustained,
served only, like the Persian invasion of Hellas, to unshackle the
whole might of the national spirit in the development of an energetic
democracy.

Thenceforth the Carthaginians and the Etruscans were no longer paramount
in the Italian waters; the Tarentines predominated in the Adriatic
and Ionic, the Massiliots and Syracusans in the Tyrrhene, seas.

The latter in particular restricted more and more the range of
Etruscan piracy.

After the victory at Cumae, Hiero had occupied the island of Aenaria
(Ischia), and by that means interrupted the communication between
the Campanian and the northern Etruscans.

About the year 302, with a view thoroughly to check Tuscan piracy,
Syracuse sent forth a special expedition, which ravaged the island of
Corsica and the Etruscan coast and occupied the island of Aethalia (Elba).
Although Etrusco-Carthaginian piracy was not wholly repressed--Antium, for
example, having apparently continued a haunt of privateering down to the
beginning of the fifth century of Rome--the powerful Syracuse
formed a strong bulwark against the allied Tuscans and Phoenicians.

For a moment, indeed, it seemed as if the Syracusan power must be
broken by the attack of the Athenians, whose naval expedition against
Syracuse in the course of the Peloponnesian war (339-341) was
supported by the Etruscans, old commercial friends of Athens, with
three fifty-oared galleys.

But the victory remained, as is well known, both in the west and in the
east with the Dorians.

After the ignominious failure of the Attic expedition, Syracuse
became so indisputably the first Greek maritime power that the men,
who were there at the head of the state, aspired to the sovereignty
of Sicily and Lower Italy, and of both the Italian seas; while on
the other hand the Carthaginians, who saw their dominion in Sicily
now seriously in danger, were on their part also obliged to make,
and made, the subjugation of the Syracusans and the reduction of
the whole island the aim of their policy.

We cannot here narrate the decline of the intermediate Sicilian
states, and the increase of the Carthaginian power in the island,
which were the immediate results of these struggles; we notice their
effect only so far as Etruria is concerned.

The new ruler of Syracuse, Dionysius (who reigned 348-387), inflicted
on Etruria blows which were severely felt.

The far-scheming king laid the foundation of his new colonial power
especially in the sea to the east of Italy, the more northern waters of
which now became, for the first time, subject to a Greek maritime power.
About the year 367, Dionysius occupied and colonized the port of Lissus
and island of Issa on the Illyrian coast, and the ports of Ancona,
Numana, and Atria, on the coast of Italy.

The memory of the Syracusan dominion in this remote region is
preserved not only by the "trenches of Philistus," a canal constructed
at the mouth of the Po beyond doubt by the well-known historian and
friend of Dionysius who spent the years of his exile (368 et seq.)
at Atria, but also by the alteration in the name of the Italian
eastern sea itself, which from this time forth, instead of its
earlier designation of the "Ionic Gulf",(3) received the appellation
still current at the present day, and probably referable to these
events, of the sea "of Hadria

."(4) But not content with these attacks on the possessions and commercial
communications of the Etruscans in the eastern sea, Dionysius
assailed the very heart of the Etruscan power by storming and
plundering Pyrgi, the rich seaport of Caere (369).

From this blow it never recovered. When the internal disturbances that
followed the death of Dionysius in Syracuse gave the Carthaginians
freer scope, and their fleet resumed in the Tyrrhene sea that
ascendency which with but slight interruptions they thenceforth
maintained, it proved a burden no less grievous to Etruscans than
to Greeks; so that, when Agathocles of Syracuse in 444 was making
preparations for war with Carthage, he was even joined by eighteen
Tuscan vessels of war.

The Etruscans perhaps had their fears in regard to Corsica, which they
probably still at that time retained. The old Etrusco-Phoenician symmachy,
which still existed in the time of Aristotle (370-432), was thus
broken up; but the Etruscans never recovered their maritime
strength.

The Romans Opposed to the Etruscans in Veii
This rapid collapse of the Etruscan maritime power would be inexplicable
but for the circumstance that, at the very time when the Sicilian
Greeks were attacking them by sea, the Etruscans found themselves
assailed with the severest blows oil every side by land.
About the time of the battles of Salamis, Himera, and Cumae a furious war
raged for many years, according to the accounts of the Roman annals,
between Rome and Veii (271-280). The Romans suffered in its course severe
defeats. Tradition especially preserved the memory of the catastrophe
of the Fabii (277), who had in consequence of internal commotions
voluntarily banished themselves from the capital(4) and had undertaken
the defence of the frontier against Etruria, and who were slain to the
last man capable of bearing arms at the brook Cremera.
But the armistice for 400 months, which in room of a peace terminated
the war, was so far favourable to the Romans that it at least restored
the -status quo- of the regal period; the Etruscans gave up Fidenae
and the district won by them on the right bank of the Tiber. We cannot
ascertain how far this Romano-Etruscan war was connected directly
with the war between the Hellenes and the Persians, and with that between
the Sicilians and Carthaginians; but whether the Romans were or
were not allies of the victors of Salamis and of Himera, there was
at any rate a coincidence of interests as well as of results.

The Samnites Opposed to the Etruscans in Campania

The Samnites as well as the Latins threw themselves upon the
Etruscans; and hardly had their Campanian settlement been cut off
from the motherland in consequence of the battle of Cumae, when it
found itself no longer able to resist the assaults of the Sabellian
mountain tribes.

Capua, the capital, fell in 330; and the Tuscan population there was soon
after the conquest extirpated or expelled by the Samnites.

It is true that the Campanian Greeks also, isolated and weakened,
suffered severely from the same invasion: Cumae itself was conquered
by the Sabellians in 334.

But the Hellenes maintained their ground at Neapolis especially,
perhaps with the aid of the Syracusans, while the Etruscan name in
Campania disappeared from history --excepting some detached Etruscan
communities, which prolonged a pitiful and forlorn existence there.

Events still more momentous, however, occurred about the same time
in Northern Italy.

A new nation was knocking at the gates of the Alps:
it was the Celts; and their first pressure fell on the Etruscans.

The Celtic, Galatian, or Gallic nation received from the common
mother endowments different from those of its Italian, Germanic,
and Hellenic sisters.

With various solid qualities and still more that were brilliant, it
was deficient in those deeper moral and political qualifications
which lie at the root of all that is good and great in human
development.

It was reckoned disgraceful, Cicero tells us, for the free Celts
to till their fields with their own hands.

They preferred a pastoral life to agriculture; and even in the
fertile plains of the Po they chiefly practised the rearing of swine,
feeding on the flesh of their herds, and staying with them in the
oak forests day and night.

Attachment to their native soil, such as characterized the Italians and the
Germans, was wanting in the Celts; while on the other hand they
delighted to congregate in towns and villages, which accordingly
acquired magnitude and importance among the Celts earlier apparently
than in Italy.

Their political constitution was imperfect.
Not only was the national unity recognized but feebly as a bond of
connection--as is, in fact, the case with all nations at first--but
the individual communities were deficient in concord and firm
control, in earnest public spirit and consistency of aim.

The only organization for which they were fitted was a military
one, where the bonds of discipline relieved the individual from the
troublesome task of self-control.

"The prominent qualities of the Celtic race," says their historian
Thierry, "were personal bravery, in which they excelled all nations;
an open impetuous temperament, accessible to every impression; much
intelligence, but at the same time extreme mobility, want of
perseverance, aversion to discipline and order, ostentation and
perpetual discord--the result of boundless vanity."

Cato the Elder more briefly describes them, nearly to the same effect;
"the Celts devote themselves mainly to two things--fighting and -esprit-."(6)
Such qualities--those of good soldiers but of bad citizens--explain
the historical fact, that the Celts have shaken all states and have
founded none.

Everywhere we find them ready to rove or, in other words, to march;
preferring moveable property to landed estate, and gold to everything
else; following the profession of arms as a system of organized
pillage or even as a trade for hire, and with such success at all
events that even the Roman historian Sallust acknowledges that the
Celts bore off the prize from the Romans in feats of arms.

They were the true soldiers-of-fortune of antiquity, as figures and
descriptions represent them: with big but not sinewy bodies, with
shaggy hair and long mustaches--quite a contrast to the Greeks and
Romans, who shaved the head and upper lip; in variegated embroidered
dresses, which in combat were not unfrequently thrown off; with a
broad gold ring round the neck; wearing no helmets and without
missile weapons of any sort, but furnished instead with an immense
shield, a long ill-tempered sword, a dagger and a lance--all
ornamented with gold, for they were not unskilful at working in
metals.

Everything was made subservient to ostentation, even wounds, which were
often subsequently enlarged for the purpose of boasting a broader scar.
Usually they fought on foot, but certain tribes on horseback, in
which case every freeman was followed by two attendants likewise
mounted; war-chariots were early in use, as they were among the
Libyans and the Hellenes in the earliest times.

Various traits remind us of the chivalry of the Middle Ages; particularly
the custom of single combat, which was foreign to the Greeks and Romans.
Not only were they accustomed during war to challenge a single
enemy to fight, after having previously insulted him by words and
gestures; during peace also they fought with each other in splendid
suits of armour, as for life or death.

After such feats carousals followed as a matter of course. In this
way they led, whether under their own or a foreign banner, a
restless soldier-life; they were dispersed from Ireland and Spain
to Asia Minor, constantly occupied in fighting and so-called feats
of heroism.

But all their enterprises melted away like snow in spring; and nowhere
did they create a great state or develop a distinctive culture of their
own.

Celtic Migrations-- The Celts Assail the Etruscans in Northern Italy
Such is the description which the ancients give us of this nation.
Its origin can only be conjectured. Sprung from the same cradle from
which the Hellenic, Italian, and Germanic peoples issued,(7) the
Celts doubtless like these migrated from their eastern motherland into
Europe, where at a very early period they reached the western ocean and
established their headquarters in what is now France, crossing to
settle in the British isles on the north, and on the south passing
the Pyrenees and contending with the Iberian tribes for the possession
of the peninsula.

This, their first great migration, flowed past the Alps, and it was from
the lands to the westward that they first began those movements of smaller
masses in the opposite direction--movements which carried them over the
Alps and the Haemus and even over the Bosporus, and by means of which
they became and for many centuries continued to be the terror of the whole
civilized nations of antiquity, till the victories of Caesar and the
frontier defence organized by Augustus for ever broke their power.

The native legend of their migrations, which has been preserved to us mainly
by Livy, relates the story of these later retrograde movements as
follows.(8) The Gallic confederacy, which was headed then as in the
time of Caesar by the canton of the Bituriges (around Bourges),
sent forth in the days of king Ambiatus two great hosts led by the
two nephews of the king.

One of these nephews, Sigovesus, crossed the Rhine and advanced in
the direction of the Black Forest, while the second, Bellovesus,
crossed the Graian Alps (the Little St.

Bernard) and descended into the valley of the Po. From the former proceeded
the Gallic settlement on the middle Danube; from the latter the oldest
Celtic settlement in the modern Lombardy, the canton of the Insubres
with Mediolanum (Milan) as its capital.

.
As far as our scanty information reaches, we find
aristocratic tendencies prevailing, in the same way as they did at the
same period in Rome, but more harshly and more perniciously. The abolition
of royalty, which appears to have been carried out in all the cities
of Etruria about the time of the siege of Veii, called into existence
in the several cities a patrician government, which experienced
but slight restraint from the laxity of the federal bond.

That bond but seldom succeeded in combining all the Etruscan cities even
for the defence of the land, and the nominal hegemony of Volsinii
does not admit of the most remote comparison with the energetic
vigour which the leadership of Rome communicated to the Latin nation.

The struggle against the exclusive claim put forward by the old burgesses
to all public offices and to all public usufructs, which must have
destroyed even the Roman state, had not its external successes
enabled it in some measure to satisfy the demands of the oppressed
proletariate at the expense of foreign nations and to open up other
paths to ambition--that struggle against the exclusive rule and
(what was specially prominent in Etruria) the priestly monopoly of
the clan-nobility--must have ruined Etruria politically, economically,
and morally.

Enormous wealth, particularly in landed property, became concentrated
in the hands of a few nobles, while the masses were impoverished;
the social revolutions which thence arose increased the distress
which they sought to remedy; and, in consequence of the impotence
of the central power, no course at last remained to the distressed
aristocrats-- e. g. in Arretium in 453, and in Volsinii in 488--but
to call in the aid of the Romans, who accordingly put an end to the
disorder but at the same time extinguished the remnant of independence.

The energies of the nation were broken from the day of Veii and
Melpum.

Earnest attempts were still once or twice made to escape from the
Roman supremacy, but in such instances the stimulus was communicated
to the Etruscans from without--from another Italian stock, the
Samnites.

is a closer affinity between the Celts and Italians than there is even
between the latter and the Hellenes. In other words they hold that the
branch of the great tree, from which the peoples of Indo-Germanic
extraction in the west and south of Europe have sprung, divided
itself in the first instance into Greeks and Italo-Celts, and that the
latter at a considerably later period became subdivided into Italians
and Celts. This hypothesis commends itself much to acceptance in a
geographical point of view, and the facts which history presents may
perhaps be likewise brought into harmony with it, because what has
hitherto been regarded as Graeco-Italian civilization may very well have
been Graeco-Celto-Italian--in fact we know nothing of the earliest
stage of Celtic culture.

Linguistic investigation, however, seems not to have made as yet such
progress as to warrant the insertion of its results in the primitive
history of the peoples.

8.

The legend is related by Livy, v. 34, and Justin, xxiv. 4, and
Caesar also has had it in view (B.

G. vi. 24). But the association of the migration of Bellovesus with
the founding of Massilia, by which the former is chronologically fixed
down to the middle of the second century of Rome, undoubtedly
belongs not to the native legend, which of course did not specify
dates, but to later chronologizing research; and it deserves no
credit.

Isolated incursions and immigrations may have taken place at a very
early period; but the great overflowing of northern Italy by the Celts
cannot be placed before the age of the decay of the Etruscan power,
that is, not before the second half of the third century of the
city.

In like manner, after the judicious investigations of Wickham and
Cramer, we cannot doubt that the line of march of Bellovesus, like
that of Hannibal, lay not over the Cottian Alps (Mont Genevre) and
through the territory of the Taurini, but over the Graian Alps (the
Little St.

Bernard) and through the territory of the Salassi.

The name of the mountain is given by Livy doubtless not on the authority
of the legend, but on his own conjecture.

Whether the representation that the Italian Boii came through the
more easterly pass of the Poenine Alps rested on the ground of a
genuine legendary reminiscence, or only on the ground of an assumed
connection with the Boii dwelling to the north of the Danube, is a
question that must remain undecided.

9.

This is according to the current computation 390 B.

C.; but, in fact, the capture of Rome occurred in Ol. 98, 1 = 388 B.

C., and has been thrown out of its proper place merely by the confusion of
the Roman calendar.

CHAPTER V
Subjugation of the Latins and Campanians by Rome
The Hegemony of Rome over Latium Shaken and Re-established
The great achievement of the regal period was the establishment of
the sovereignty of Rome over Latium under the form of hegemony.

It is in the nature of the case evident that the change in the constitution
of Rome could not but powerfully affect both the relations of the
Roman state towards Latium and the internal organization of the
Latin communities themselves; and that it did so, is obvious from
tradition.

The fluctuations which the revolution in Rome occasioned in the
Romano-Latin confederacy are attested by the legend, unusually vivid
and various in its hues, of the victory at the lake Regillus, which
the dictator or consul Aulus Postumius (255?

258?) is said to have gained over the Latins with the help of the Dioscuri,
and still more definitely by the renewal of the perpetual league
between Rome and Latium by Spurius Cassius in his second consulate
(261).

These narratives, however, give us no information as to the main
matter, the legal relation between the new Roman republic and the
Latin confederacy; and what from other sources we learn regarding
that relation comes to us without date, and can only be inserted
here with an approximation to probability.

Original Equality of Rights between Rome and Latium
The nature of a hegemony implies that it becomes gradually converted
into sovereignty by the mere inward force of circumstances; and the
Roman hegemony over Latium formed no exception to the rule.

It was based upon the essential equality of rights between the Roman
state on the one side and the Latin confederacy on the other;(1)
but at least in matters of war and in the treatment of the acquisitions
thereby made this relation between the single state on the one hand
and the league of states on the other virtually involved a hegemony.

According to the original constitution of the league not only was the right
of making wars and treaties with foreign states--in other words, the
full right of political self-determination--reserved in all probability
both to Rome and to the individual towns of the Latin league; and when a
joint war took place, Rome and Latium probably furnished the like
contingent, each, as a rule, an "army" of 8400 men;(2) but the chief
command was held by the Roman general, who then nominated the officers
of the staff, and so the leaders-of-division (-tribuni militum-),
according to his own choice.

In case of victory the moveable part of the spoil, as well as the
conquered territory, was shared between Rome and the confederacy;
when the establishment of fortresses in the conquered territory was
resolved on, their garrisons and population were composed partly
of Roman, partly of confederate colonists; and not only so, but the
newly-founded community was received as a sovereign federal state
into the Latin confederacy and furnished with a seat and vote in
the Latin diet.

Encroachments on That Equality of Rights-- As to Wars and Treaties--
As to the Officering of the Army-- As to Acquisitions in War
These stipulations must probably even in the regal period, certainly
in the republican epoch, have undergone alteration more and more
to the disadvantage of the confederacy and to the further development
of the hegemony of Rome.

The earliest that fell into abeyance was beyond doubt the right of the
confederacy to make wars and treaties with foreigners;(3) the decision
of war and treaty passed once for all to Rome.

The staff officers for the Latin troops must doubtless in earlier times
have been likewise Latins; afterwards for that purpose Roman citizens
were taken, if not exclusively, at any rate predominantly.(4)
On the other hand, afterwards as formerly, no stronger contingent could
be demanded from the Latin confederacy as a whole than was furnished by
the Roman community; and the Roman commander-in-chief was likewise
bound not to break up the Latin contingents, but to keep the
contingent sent by each community as a separate division of the
army under the leader whom that community had appointed.(5) The
right of the Latin confederacy to an equal share in the moveable
spoil and in the conquered land continued to subsist in form; in
reality, however, the substantial fruits of war beyond doubt went,
even at an early period, to the leading state.

Even in the founding of the federal fortresses or the so-called Latin
colonies as a rule presumably most, and not unfrequently all, of the
colonists were Romans; and although by the transference they were
converted from Roman burgesses into members of an allied community,
the newly planted township in all probability frequently retained
a preponderant--and for the confederacy dangerous--attachment to
the real mother-city.

Private Rights

The rights, on the contrary, which were secured by the federal
treaties to the individual burgess of one of the allied communities
in every city belonging to the league, underwent no restriction.

These included, in particular, full equality of rights as to the
acquisition of landed property and moveable estate, as to traffic
and exchange, marriage and testament, and an unlimited liberty of
migration; so that not only was a man who had burgess-rights in a
town of the league legally entitled to settle in any other, but
whereever he settled, he as a right-sharer (-municeps-) participated
in all private and political rights and duties with the exception
of eligibility to office, and was even--although in a limited fashion
--entitled to vote at least in the -comitia tributa-.(6)
Of some such nature, in all probability, was the relation between
the Roman community and the Latin confederacy in the first period
of the republic.

We cannot, however ascertain what elements are to be referred to earlier
stipulations, and what to the revision of the alliance in 261.

With somewhat greater certainty the remodelling of the arrangements of the
several communities belonging to the Latin confederacy, after the
pattern of the consular constitution in Rome, may be characterized
as an innovation and introduced in this connection.

For, although the different communities may very well have arrived at
the abolition of royalty in itself independently of each other,(7) the
identity in the appellation of the new annual kings in the Roman and
other commonwealths of Latium, and the comprehensive application of the
peculiar principle of collegiateness,(8) evidently point to some external
connection.

At some time or other after the expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome
the arrangements of the Latin communities must have been throughout
revised in accordance with the scheme of the consular constitution.

This adjustment of the Latin constitutions in conformity with that of the
leading city may possibly belong only to a later period; but
internal probability rather favours the supposition that the Roman
nobility, after having effected the abolition of royalty for life
at home, suggested a similar change of constitution to the communities
of the Latin confederacy, and at length introduced aristocratic
government everywhere in Latium-- notwithstanding the serious
resistance, imperilling the stability of the Romano-Latin league
itself, which seems to have been offered on the one hand by the
expelled Tarquins, and on the other by the royal clans and by
partisans well affected to monarchy in the other communities of
Latium.

The mighty development of the power of Etruria that occurred at this very
time, the constant assaults of the Veientes, and the expedition of
Porsena, may have materially contributed to secure the adherence of the
Latin nation to the once-established form of union, or, in other words,
to the continued recognition of the supremacy of Rome, and disposed
them for its sake to acquiesce in a change of constitution for
which, beyond doubt, the way had been in many respects prepared even in
the bosom of the Latin communities, nay perhaps to submit even to an
enlargement of the rights of hegemony.

Extension of Rome and Latium to the East and South
The permanently united nation was able not only to maintain, but also to
extend on all sides its power.

We have already(9) mentioned that the Etruscans remained only for a short
time in possession of supremacy over Latium, and that the relations
there soon returned to the position in which they stood during the
regal period; but it was not till more than a century after the
expulsion of the kings from Rome that any real extension of the
Roman boundaries took place in this direction.

With the Sabines who occupied the middle mountain range from the borders
of the Umbrians down to the region between the Tiber and the Anio,
and who, at the epoch when the history of Rome begins, penetrated
fighting and conquering as far as Latium itself, the Romans
notwithstanding their immediate neighbourhood subsequently came
comparatively little into contact.

The feeble sympathy of the Sabines with the desperate resistance
offered by the neighbouring peoples in the east and south, is
evident even from the accounts of the annals; and--what is of more
importance--we find here no fortresses to keep the land in subjection,
such as were so numerously established especially in the Volscian
plain.

Perhaps this lack of opposition was connected with the fact that the
Sabine hordes probably about this very time poured themselves over
Lower Italy.

Allured by the pleasantness of the settlements on the Tifernus and
Volturnus, they appear to have interfered but little in the conflicts
of which the region to the south of the Tiber was the arena.

At the Expense of the Aequi and Volsci-- League with the Hernici
Far more vehement and lasting was the resistance of the Aequi, who,
having their settlements to the eastward of Rome as far as the
valleys of the Turano and Salto and on the northern verge of the
Fucine lake, bordered with the Sabines and Marsi,(10) and of the
Volsci, who to the south of the Rutuli settled around Ardea, and
of the Latins extending southward as far as Cora, possessed the
coast almost as far as the river Liris along with the adjacent
islands and in the interior the whole region drained by the Liris.

We do not intend to narrate the feuds annually renewed with these two
peoples--feuds which are related in the Roman chronicles in such
a way that the most insignificant foray is scarcely distinguishable
from a momentous war, and historical connection is totally disregarded;
it is sufficient to indicate the permanent results.

We plainly perceive that it was the especial aim of the Romans and Latins
to separate the Aequi from the Volsci, and to become masters of
the communications between them; in the region between the southern
slope of the Alban range, the Volscian mountains and the Pomptine
marshes, moreover, the Latins and the Volscians appear to have come
first into contact and to have even had their settlements
intermingled.(11) In this region the Latins took the first steps
beyond the bounds of their own land, and federal fortresses on
foreign soil--Latin colonies, as they were called--were first
established, namely: in the plain Velitrae (as is alleged, about
260) beneath the Alban range itself, and Suessa in the Pomptine low
lands, in the mountains Norba (as is alleged, in 262) and Signia
(alleged to have been strengthened in 259), both of which lie at
the points of connection between the Aequian and Volscian
territories.

The object was attained still more fully by the accession of the
Hernici to the league of the Romans and Latins (268), an accession
which isolated the Volscians completely, and provided the league
with a bulwark against the Sabellian tribes dwelling on the south
and east; it is easy therefore to perceive why this little people
obtained the concession of full equality with the two others in
counsel and in distribution of the spoil.

The feebler Aequi were thenceforth but little formidable; it was sufficient
to undertake from time to time a plundering expedition against them. The
Rutuli also, who bordered with Latium on the south in the plain along
the coast, early succumbed; their town Ardea was converted into a
Latin colony as early as 312.(12) The Volscians opposed a more serious
resistance.

The first notable success, after those mentioned above, achieved
over them by the Romans was, remarkably enough, the foundation of
Circeii in 361, which, as long as Antium and Tarracina continued
free, can only have held communication with Latium by sea.

Attempts were often made to occupy Antium, and one was temporarily
successful in 287; but in 295 the town recovered its freedom, and it
was not till after the Gallic conflagration that, in consequence
of a violent war of thirteen years (365-377), the Romans gained a
decided superiority in the Antiate and Pomptine territory.

Satricum, not far from Antium, was occupied with a Latin colony in 369,
and not long afterwards probably Antium itself as well as Tarracina.(13)
The Pomptine territory was secured by the founding of the fortress
Setia (372, strengthened in 375), and was distributed into farm-allotments
and burgess-districts in the year 371 and following years.

After this date the Volscians still perhaps rose in revolt, but
they waged no further wars against Rome.

Crises within the Romano-Latin League
But the more decided the successes that the league of Romans,
Latins, and Hernici achieved against the Etruscans, Aequi, Volsci, and
Rutuli, the more that league became liable to disunion.

The reason lay partly in the increase of the hegemonic power of Rome, of
which we have already spoken as necessarily springing out of
the existing circumstances, but which nevertheless was felt as a
heavy burden in Latium; partly in particular acts of odious injustice
perpetrated by the leading community.

Of this nature was especially the infamous sentence of arbitration between
the Aricini and the Rutuli in Ardea in 308, in which the Romans,
called in to be arbiters regarding a border territory in dispute between
the two communities, took it to themselves; and when this decision
occasioned in Ardea internal dissensions in which the people wished to
join the Volsci, while the nobility adhered to Rome, these dissensions
were still more disgracefully employed as a pretext for the--already
mentioned --sending of Roman colonists into the wealthy city, amongst
whom the lands of the adherents of the party opposed to Rome were
distributed (312).

The main cause however of the internal breaking up of the league
was the very subjugation of the common foe; forbearance ceased on one side,
devotedness ceased on the other, from the time when they thought that
they had no longer need of each other. The open breach between the
Latins and Hernici on the one hand and the Romans on the other was
more immediately occasioned partly by the capture of Rome by the
Celts and the momentary weakness which it produced, partly by the
definitive occupation and distribution of the Pomptine territory.

The former allies soon stood opposed in the field. Already Latin volunteers
in great numbers had taken part in the last despairing struggle of the
Antiates: now the most famous of the Latin cities, Lanuvium (371), Praeneste
(372-374, 400), Tusculum (373), Tibur (394, 400), and even several
of the fortresses established in the Volscian land by the Romano-Latin
league, such as Velitrae and Circeii, had to be subdued by force of arms,
and the Tiburtines were not afraid even to make common cause against
Rome with the once more advancing hordes of the Gauls. No concerted
revolt however took place, and Rome mastered the individual towns without
much trouble.

Tusculum was even compelled (in 373) to give up its political independence,
and to enter into the burgess-union of Rome as a subject community (-civitas
sine suffragio-) so that the town retained its walls and an--although
limited--self-administration, including magistrates and a
burgess-assembly of its own, whereas its burgesses as Romans lacked
the right of electing or being elected --the first instance of a
whole burgess-body being incorporated as a dependent community with
the Roman commonwealth.

Renewal of the Treaties of Alliance

The struggle with the Hernici was more severe (392-396); the first
consular commander-in-chief belonging to the plebs, Lucius Genucius,
fell in it; but here too the Romans were victorious.

The crisis terminated with the renewal of the treaties between Rome
and the Latin and Hernican confederacies in 396.

The precise contents of these treaties are not known, but it is
evident that both confederacies submitted once more, and probably
on harder terms, to the Roman hegemony.

The institution which took place in the same year of two new tribes
in the Pomptine territory shows clearly the mighty advances made
by the Roman power.

Closing of the Latin Confederation
In manifest connection with this crisis in the relations between
Rome and Latium stands the closing of the Latin confederation,(14)
which took place about the year 370, although we cannot precisely
determine whether it was the effect or, as is more probable, the
cause of the revolt of Latium against Rome which we have just
described.

As the law had hitherto stood, every sovereign city founded by Rome
and Latium took its place among the communes entitled to participate
in the federal festival and federal diet, whereas every community
incorporated with another city and thereby politically annihilated
was erased from the ranks of the members of the league.

At the same time, however, according to Latin use and wont the
number once fixed of thirty confederate communities was so adhered
to, that of the participating cities never more and never less than
thirty were entitled to vote, and a number of the communities that
were of later admission, or were disqualified for their slight
importance or for the crimes they had committed, were without the
right of voting.

In this way the confederacy was constituted about 370 as follows.
Of old Latin townships there were--besides some which have now
fallen into oblivion, or whose sites are unknown--still autonomous and
entitled to vote, Nomentum, between the Tiber and the Anio; Tibur, Gabii,
Scaptia, Labici,(15) Pedum, and Praeneste, between the Anio and
the Alban range; Corbio, Tusculum, Bovillae, Aricia, Corioli, and
Lanuvium on the Alban range; Cora in the Volscian mountains, and
lastly, Laurentum in the plain along the coast.

To these fell to be added the colonies instituted by Rome and the
Latin league; Ardea in the former territory of the Rutuli, and
Satricum, Velitrae, Norba, Signia, Setia and Circeii in that of the
Volsci.

CHAPTER I
Change of the Constitution-- Limitation of the Power of the Magistrate

Political and Social Distinctions in Rome
The strict conception of the unity and omnipotence of the state in all
matters pertaining to it, which was the central principle of the
Italian constitutions, placed in the hands of the single president
nominated for life a formidable power, which was felt doubtless by the
enemies of the land, but was not less heavily felt by its citizens.
Abuse and oppression could not fail to ensue, and, as a necessary
consequence, efforts were made to lessen that power. It was, however,
the grand distinction of the endeavours after reform and the
revolutions in Rome, that there was no attempt either to impose
limitations on the community as such or even to deprive it of
corresponding organs of expression--that there never was any endeavour
to assert the so-called natural rights of the individual in
contradistinction to the community--that, on the contrary, the
attack was wholly directed against the form in which the community
was represented.

From the times of the Tarquins down to those of the Gracchi the cry of the
party of progress in Rome was not for limitation of the power of
the state, but for limitation of the power of the magistrates: nor
amidst that cry was the truth ever forgotten, that the people ought
not to govern, but to be governed.

This struggle was carried on within the burgess-body. Side by side with it
another movement developed itself--the cry of the non-burgesses
for equality of political privileges.

Under this head are included the agitations of the plebeians, the Latins,
the Italians, and the freedmen, all of whom--whether they may have
borne the name of burgesses, as did the plebeians and the freedmen,
or not, as was the case with the Latins and Italians--were destitute
of, and desired, political equality.

A third distinction was one of a still more general nature; the
distinction between the wealthy and the poor, especially such as
had been dispossessed or were endangered in possession.

The legal and political relations of Rome led to the rise of a numerous
class of farmers--partly small proprietors who were dependent on the
mercy of the capitalist, partly small temporary lessees who
were dependent on the mercy of the landlord--and in many instances
deprived individuals as well as whole communities of the lands which
they held, without affecting their personal freedom.

By these means the agricultural proletariate became at an early period
so powerful as to have a material influence on the destinies of
the community.

The urban proletariate did not acquire political importance till a much
later epoch.

On these distinctions hinged the internal history of Rome, and, as
may be presumed, not less the history--totally lost to us--of the other
Italian communities. The political movement within the fully-privileged
burgess-body, the warfare between the excluded and excluding classes,
and the social conflicts between the possessors and the non-possessors
of land--variously as they crossed and interlaced, and singular
as were the alliances they often produced --were nevertheless
essentially and fundamentally distinct.

Abolition of the Life-Presidency of the Community
As the Servian reform, which placed the --metoikos-- on a footing of
equality in a military point of view with the burgess, appears to
have originated from considerations of an administrative nature rather
than from any political party-tendency, we may assume that the first of
the movements which led to internal crises and changes of the constitution
was that which sought to limit the magistracy.

The earliest achievement of this, the most ancient opposition in Rome,
consisted in the abolition of the life-tenure of the presidency of the
community; in other words, in the abolition of the monarchy. How
necessarily this was the result of the natural development of things,
is most strikingly demonstrated by the fact, that the same change
of constitution took place in an analogous manner through the whole
circuit of the Italo-Grecian world.

Not only in Rome, but likewise among the other Latins as well as among
the Sabellians, Etruscans, and Apulians--and generally, in all the Italian
communities, just as in those of Greece--we find the rulers for life
of an earlier epoch superseded in after times by annual magistrates. In
the case of the Lucanian canton there is evidence that it had a
democratic government in time of peace, and it was only in the event
of war that the magistrates appointed a king, that is, an official
similar to the Roman dictator.

The Sabellian civic communities, such as those of Capua and Pompeii,
in like manner were in later times governed by a "community-manager" (-medix
tuticus-) changed from year to year, and we may assume that similar
institutions existed among the other national and civic communities
of Italy.

In this light the reasons which led to the substitution of consuls for
kings in Rome need no explanation. The organism of the ancient Greek
and Italian polity developed of itself by a sort of natural necessity
the limitation of the life-presidency to a shortened, and for the most
part an annual, term.

Simple, however, as was the cause of this change, it might be brought
about in various ways; a resolution might be adopted on the death
of one life-ruler not to elect another--a course which the Roman
senate is said to have attempted after the death of Romulus; or the
ruler might voluntarily abdicate, as is alleged to have been the
intention of king Servius Tullius; or the people might rise in
rebellion against a tyrannical ruler, and expel him.

Expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome
It was in this latter way that the monarchy was terminated in Rome.
For however much the history of the expulsion of the last Tarquinius,
"the proud," may have been interwoven with anecdotes and spun out
into a romance, it is not in its leading outlines to be called in
question.

Tradition credibly enough indicates as the causes of the revolt, that
the king neglected to consult the senate and to complete its numbers;
that he pronounced sentences of capital punishment and confiscation
without advising with his counsellors; that he accumulated immense
stores of grain in his granaries, and exacted from the burgesses military
labour and task-work beyond what was due. The exasperation of the people
is attested by the formal vow which they made man by man for themselves
and for their posterity that thenceforth they would never tolerate a king;
by the blind hatred with which the name of king was ever afterwards regarded
in Rome; and above all by the enactment that the "king for offering
sacrifice" (-rex sacrorum- or -sacrificulus-) --whom they considered
it their duty to create that the gods might not miss their accustomed
mediator--should be disqualified from holding any further office,
so that this man became the foremost indeed, but also the most
powerless in the Roman commonwealth.

Along with the last king all the members of his clan were banished--a
proof how close at that time gentile ties still were. The Tarquinii thereupon
transferred themselves to Caere, perhaps their ancient home,(1) where
their family tomb has recently been discovered.
In the room of the one president holding office for life two annual rulers
were now placed at the head of the Roman community.

This is all that can be looked upon as historically certain in reference
to this important event.(2) It is conceivable that in a great community
with extensive dominion like the Roman the royal power, particularly
if it had been in the same family for several generations, would
be more capable of resistance, and the struggle would thus be keener,
than in the smaller states; but there is no certain indication of
any interference by foreign states in the struggle.

The great war with Etruria--which possibly, moreover, has been placed
so close upon the expulsion of the Tarquins only in consequence
of chronological confusion in the Roman annals--cannot be regarded as
an intervention of Etruria in favour of a countryman who had been
injured in Rome, for the very sufficient reason that the Etruscans
notwithstanding their complete victory neither restored the Roman
monarchy, nor even brought back the Tarquinian family.

Powers of the Consuls
If we are left in ignorance of the historical connections of this
important event, we are fortunately in possession of clearer light as
to the nature of the change which was made in the constitution. The royal
power was by no means abolished, as is shown by the very fact that, when
a vacancy occurred afterwards as before, an "interim king" (-interrex-)
was nominated. The one life-king was simply replaced by two year-kings,
who called themselves generals (-praetores-), or judges (-iudices-),
or merely colleagues (consules).(3) The principles of collegiate tenure
and of annual duration are those which distinguish the republic from the
monarchy, and they first meet us here.

Collegiate Arrangement
The collegiate principle, from which the third and subsequently most current
name of the annual kings was derived, assumed in their case an
altogether peculiar form. The supreme power was not entrusted to the two
magistrates conjointly, but each consul possessed and exercised it
for himself as fully and wholly as it had been possessed and exercised by
the king. This was carried so far that, instead of one of the
two colleagues undertaking perhaps the administration of justice, and
the other the command of the army, they both administered justice
simultaneously in the city just as they both set out together to the army;
in case of collision the matter was decided by a rotation measured by
months or days. A certain partition of functions withal, at least in
the supreme military command, might doubtless take place from the outset--the
one consul for example taking the field against the Aequi, and
the other against the Volsci--but it had in no wise binding force, and
each of the colleagues was legally at liberty to interfere at any time in
the province of the other. When, therefore, supreme power confronted
supreme power and the one colleague forbade what the other enjoined,
the consular commands neutralized each other.
This peculiarly Latin, if not peculiarly Roman, institution of co-ordinate
supreme authorities--which in the Roman commonwealth on the whole
approved itself as practicable, but to which it will be difficult to find
a parallel in any other considerable state --manifestly sprang out
of the endeavour to retain the regal power in legally undiminished
fulness. They were thus led not to break up the royal office into parts
or to transfer it from an individual to a college, but simply to double
it and thereby, if necessary, to neutralize it through its own
action.

Term of Office
As regards the termination of their tenure of office, the earlier -interregnum-
of five days furnished a legal precedent. The ordinary presidents
of the community were bound not to remain in office longer than a year
reckoned from the day of their entering on their functions;(4) and they
ceased -de jure- to be magistrates upon the expiry of the year, just as
the interrex on the expiry of the five days. Through this set termination
of the supreme office the practical irresponsibility of the king was
lost in the case of the consul. It is true that the king was always
in the Roman commonwealth subject, and not superior, to the law; but,
as according to the Roman view the supreme judge could not be prosecuted
at his own bar, the king might doubtless have committed a crime, but
there was for him no tribunal and no punishment. The consul, again, if he
had committed murder or treason, was protected by his office, but
only so long as it lasted; on his retirement he was liable to the ordinary
penal jurisdiction like any other burgess.

To these leading changes, affecting the principles of the constitution,
other restrictions were added of a subordinate and more external
character, some of which nevertheless produced a deep effect The
privilege of the king to have his fields tilled by task-work of the
burgesses, and the special relation of clientship in which the
--metoeci-- as a body must have stood to the king, ceased of
themselves with the life tenure of the office.

Right of Appeal
Hitherto in criminal processes as well as in fines and corporal
punishments it had been the province of the king not only to
investigate and decide the cause, but also to decide whether the
person found guilty should or should not be allowed to appeal for
pardon.

The Valerian law now (in 245) enacted that the consul must allow the
appeal of the condemned, where sentence of capital or corporal punishment
had been pronounced otherwise than by martial law--a regulation which
by a later law (of uncertain date, but passed before 303) was extended
to heavy fines.

In token of this right of appeal, when the consul appeared in the capacity
of judge and not of general, the consular lictors laid aside the
axes which they had previously carried by virtue of the penal
jurisdiction belonging to their master.

The law however threatened the magistrate, who did not allow due course
to the -provocatio-, with no other penalty than infamy--which, as matters
then stood, was essentially nothing but a moral stain, and at the utmost
only had the effect of disqualifying the infamous person from giving
testimony. Here too the course followed was based on the same view, that
it was in law impossible to diminish the old regal powers, and that the
checks imposed upon the holder of the supreme authority in consequence of
the revolution had, strictly viewed, only a practical and moral
value.

When therefore the consul acted within the old regal jurisdiction,
he might in so acting perpetrate an injustice, but he committed no crime
and consequently was not amenable for what he did to the penal
judge.

A limitation similar in its tendency took place in the civil jurisdiction;
for probably there was taken from the consuls at the very outset
the right of deciding at their discretion a legal dispute between
private persons.

Restrictions on the Delegation of Powers
The remodelling of the criminal as of civil procedure stood in connection
with a general arrangement respecting the transference of magisterial
power to deputies or successors.

While the king had been absolutely at liberty to nominate deputies but
had never been compelled to do so, the consuls exercised the right of
delegating power in an essentially different way.

No doubt the rule that, if the supreme magistrate left the city, he had
to appoint a warden there for the administration of justice,(5)
remained in force also for the consuls, and the collegiate arrangement
was not even extended to such delegation; on the contrary this
appointment was laid on the consul who was the last to leave the
city.

But the right of delegation for the time when the consuls remained in the
city was probably restricted, upon the very introduction of this office,
by providing that delegation should be prescribed to the consul
for definite cases, but should be prohibited for all cases in which
it was not so prescribed.

According to this principle, as we have said, the whole judicial system was
organized. The consul could certainly exercise criminal jurisdiction also
as to a capital process in the way of submitting his sentence to the
community and having it thereupon confirmed or rejected; but he
never, so far as we see, exercised this right, perhaps was soon not
allowed to exercise it, and possibly pronounced a criminal judgment only
in the case of appeal to the community being for any reason excluded.
Direct conflict between the supreme magistrate of the community and
the community itself was avoided, and the criminal procedure was
organized really in such a way, that the supreme magistracy remained
only in theory competent, but always acted through deputies who
were necessary though appointed by himself.

These were the two--not standing--pronouncers-of-judgment for revolt and
high treason (-duoviri perduellionis-) and the two standing trackers
of murder, the -quaestores parricidii-. Something similar may perhaps
have occurred in the regal period, where the king had himself
represented in such processes;(6) but the standing character of the
latter institution, and the collegiate principle carried out in
both, belong at any rate to the republic.

The latter arrangement became of great importance also, in so far
that thereby for the first time alongside of the two standing supreme
magistrates were placed two assistants, whom each supreme magistrate
nominated at his entrance on office, and who in due course also
went out with him on his leaving it--whose position thus, like the
supreme magistracy itself, was organized according to the principles
of a standing office, of a collegiate form, and of an annual tenure.

This only may perhaps be alleged by way of excuse for the nobility,
that after it had neglected the right moment for this purpose at
the abolition of the monarchy, it was no longer in a position
subsequently of itself to retrieve the neglect (II.

I. The New Community).

4. Whether this distinction between these "curule houses" and the other
families embraced within the patriciate was ever of serious
political importance, cannot with certainty be either affirmed or denied;
and as little do we know whether at this epoch there really was any
considerable number of patrician families that were not yet curule.

which play so great a part in the moral anecdote-books of a later
age, mainly rest on a misunderstanding on the one hand of the old
frugal economy--which might very well consist with considerable
prosperity --and on the other hand of the beautiful old custom of
burying men who had deserved well of the state from the proceeds
of penny collections --which was far from being a pauper burial.

The method also of explaining surnames by etymological guess-work,
which has imported so many absurdities into Roman history, has
furnished its quota to this belief (-Serranus-).

16. Any one who compares the consular Fasti before and after 412 will have
no doubt as to the existence of the above-mentioned law respecting re-election
to the consulate; for, while before that year a return to office,
especially after three or four years, was a common occurrence,
afterwards intervals of ten years and more were as frequent.

Exceptions, however, occur in very great numbers, particularly
during the severe years of war 434-443.

On the other hand, the principle of not allowing a plurality of
offices was strictly adhered to.

There is no certain instance of the combination of two of the three
ordinary curule (Liv. xxxix. 39, 4) offices (the consulate,
praetorship, and curule aedileship), but instances occur of other
combinations, such as of the curule aedileship and the office of
master of the horse (Liv. xxiii. 24, 30); of the praetorship and
censorship (Fast.

Cap. a. 501); of the praetorship and the dictatorship (Liv. viii.

The
increase of the indirect and extraordinary sources of revenue, and the
flourishing condition of the Roman finances in general, rendered it but
seldom necessary to levy any contribution from the farmers in the form
of a forced loan. While the earlier small holdings were probably lost
beyond recovery, the rising average of Roman prosperity must have
converted the former larger landholders into farmers, and in so far
added new members to the middle class.

People of rank sought principally to secure the large newly-acquired
districts for occupation; the mass of wealth which flowed to Rome
through war and commerce must have reduced the rate of interest;
the increase in the population of the capital benefited the farmer
throughout Latium; a wise system of incorporation united a number
of neighbouring and formerly subject communities with the Roman
state, and thereby strengthened especially the middle class; finally,
the glorious victories and their mighty results silenced faction.

If the distress of the farmers was by no means removed and still less
were its sources stopped, it yet admits of no doubt that at the close
of this period the Roman middle class was on the whole in a far
less oppressed condition than in the first century after the expulsion
of the kings.

Civic Equality
Lastly civic equality was in a certain sense undoubtedly attained
or rather restored by the reform of 387, and the development of its
legitimate consequences.

As formerly, when the patricians still in fact formed the burgesses, these
had stood upon a footing of absolute equality in rights and duties,
so now in the enlarged burgess-body there existed in the eye of the
law no arbitrary distinctions.

The gradations to which differences of age, sagacity, cultivation, and
wealth necessarily give rise in civil society, naturally also
pervaded the sphere of public life; but the spirit animating the
burgesses and the policy of the government uniformly operated so
as to render these differences as little conspicuous as possible.

The whole system of Rome tended to train up her burgesses on an
average as sound and capable, but not to bring into prominence the
gifts of genius.

The growth of culture among the Romans did not at all keep pace with the
development of the power of their community, and it was instinctively
repressed rather than promoted by those in power.

That there should be rich and poor, could not be prevented; but (as in a
genuine community of farmers) the farmer as well as the day-labourer
personally guided the plough, and even for the rich the good economic
rule held good that they should live with uniform frugality and
above all should hoard no unproductive capital at home--excepting
the salt-cellar and the sacrificial ladle, no silver articles were
at this period seen in any Roman house.

Nor was this of little moment.
In the mighty successes which the Roman community externally achieved
during the century from the last Veientine down to the Pyrrhic war
we perceive that the patriciate has now given place to the farmers;
that the fall of the highborn Fabian would have been not more and
not less lamented by the whole community than the fall of the
plebeian Decian was lamented alike by plebeians and patricians;
that the consulate did not of itself fall even to the wealthiest
aristocrat; and that a poor husbandman from Sabina, Manius Curius,
could conquer king Pyrrhus in the field of battle and chase him out
of Italy, without ceasing to be a simple Sabine farmer and to
cultivate in person his own bread-corn.

New Aristocracy

In regard however to this imposing republican equality we must not overlook
the fact that it was to a considerable extent only formal, and
that an aristocracy of a very decided stamp grew out of it or rather
was contained in it from the very first.

The non-patrician families of wealth and consideration had long ago
separated from the plebs, and leagued themselves with the patriciate
in the participation of senatorial rights and in the prosecution
of a policy distinct from that of the plebs and very often counteracting
it.

The Licinian laws abrogated the legal distinctions within the ranks of
the aristocracy, and changed the character of the barrier which
excluded the plebeian from the government, so that it was no longer
a hindrance unalterable in law, but one, not indeed insurmountable,
but yet difficult to be surmounted in practice.

In both ways fresh blood was mingled with the ruling order in Rome; but
in itself the government still remained, as before, aristocratic. In
this respect the Roman community was a genuine farmer-commonwealth,
in which the rich holder of a whole hide was little distinguished
externally from the poor cottager and held intercourse with him on
equal terms, but aristocracy nevertheless exercised so all-powerful
a sway that a man without means far sooner rose to be master of the
burgesses in the city than mayor in his own village.

It was a very great and valuable gain, that under the new legislation
even the poorest burgess might fill the highest office of the state;
nevertheless it was a rare exception when a man from the lower ranks
of the population reached such a position,(11) and not only so, but
probably it was, at least towards the close of this period, possible
only by means of an election carried by the opposition.

New Opposition
Every aristocratic government of itself calls forth a corresponding
opposition party; and as the formal equalization of the orders
only modified the aristocracy, and the new ruling order not only
succeeded the old patriciate but engrafted itself on it and intimately
coalesced with it, the opposition also continued to exist and in
all respects pursued a similar course.

As it was now no longer the plebeian burgesses as such, but the common
people, that were treated as inferior, the new opposition professed
from the first to be the representative of the lower classes and
particularly of the small farmers; and as the new aristocracy
attached itself to the patriciate, so the first movements of this
new opposition were interwoven with the final struggles against the
privileges of the patricians.

The first names in the series of these new Roman popular leaders were
Manius Curius (consul 464, 479, 480; censor 481) and Gaius Fabricius
(consul 472, 476, 481; censor 479); both of them men without ancestral
lineage and without wealth, both summoned--in opposition to the
aristocratic principle of restricting re-election to the highest
office of the state--thrice by the votes of the burgesses to the
chief magistracy, both, as tribunes, consuls, and censors, opponents
of patrician privileges and defenders of the small farmer-class
against the incipient arrogance of the leading houses.

The future parties were already marked out; but the interests of
party were still suspended on both sides in presence of the interests
of the commonweal.

The patrician Appius Claudius and the farmer Manius Curius--vehement in
their personal antagonism--jointly by wise counsel and vigorous action
conquered king Pyrrhus; and while Gaius Fabricius as censor inflicted
penalties on Publius Cornelius Rufinus for his aristocratic sentiments
and aristocratic habits, this did not prevent him from supporting the
claim of Rufinus to a second consulate on account of his recognized
ability as a general.

The breach was already formed; but the adversaries still shook hands
across it.

The New Government
The termination of the struggles between the old and new burgesses,
the various and comparatively successful endeavours to relieve the
middle class, and the germs--already making their appearance amidst
the newly acquired civic equality--of the formation of a new
aristocratic and a new democratic party, have thus been passed in
review.

It remains that we describe the shape which the new government
assumed amidst these changes, and the positions in which after the
political abolition of the nobility the three elements of the
republican commonwealth--the burgesses, the magistrates, and the
senate--stood towards each other.

The Burgess-Body-- Its Composition
The burgesses in their ordinary assemblies continued as hitherto to be the
highest authority in the commonwealth and the legal sovereign.

But it was settled by law that--apart from the matters committed
once for all to the decision of the centuries, such as the election
of consuls and censors--voting by districts should be just as valid
as voting by centuries: a regulation introduced as regards the
patricio-plebeian assembly by the Valerio-Horatian law of 305(12)
and extended by the Publilian law of 415, but enacted as regards
the plebeian separate assembly by the Hortensian law about 467.(13)
We have already noticed that the same individuals, on the whole,
were entitled to vote in both assemblies, but that--apart from the
exclusion of the patricians from the plebeian separate assembly--in
the general assembly of the districts all entitled to vote were on
a footing of equality, while in the centuriate comitia the working
of the suffrage was graduated with reference to the means of the
voters, and in so far, therefore, the change was certainly a levelling
and democratic innovation.

It was a circumstance of far greater importance that, towards the
end of this period, the primitive freehold basis of the right of suffrage
began for the first time to be called in question.
Appius Claudius, the boldest innovator known in Roman history, in his
censorship in 442 without consulting the senate or people so adjusted
the burgess-roll, that a man who had no land was received into
whatever tribe he chose and then according to his means into the
corresponding century.

But this alteration was too far in advance of the spirit of the age to
obtain full acceptance.

One of the immediate successors of Appius, Quintus Fabius Rullianus,
the famous conqueror of the Samnites, undertook in his censorship
of 450 not to set it aside entirely, but to confine it within such
limits that the real power in the burgess-assemblies should continue
to be vested in the holders of land and of wealth.

He assigned those who had no land collectively to the four city
tribes, which were now made to rank not as the first but as the last.

The rural tribes, on the other hand, the number of which gradually
increased between 367 and 513 from seventeen to thirty-one--thus
forming a majority, greatly preponderating from the first and ever
increasing in preponderance, of the voting-divisions--were reserved
by law for the whole of the burgesses who were freeholders.

In the centuries the equalization of the freeholders and non-freeholders
remained as Appius had introduced it.

In this manner provision was made for the preponderance of the freeholders
in the comitia of the tribes, while for the centuriate comitia in themselves
the wealthy already turned the scale. By this wise and moderate arrangement
on the part of a man who for his warlike feats and still more for
this peaceful achievement justly received the surname of the Great
(-Maximus-), on the one hand the duty of bearing arms was extended,
as was fitting, also to the non-freehold burgesses; on the other
hand care was taken that their influence, especially that of those
who had once been slaves and who were for the most part without
property in land, should be subjected to that check which is
unfortunately, in a state allowing slavery, an indispensable
necessity.

A peculiar moral jurisdiction, moreover, which gradually came to be
associated with the census and the making up of the burgess-roll,
excluded from the burgess-body all individuals notoriously unworthy,
and guarded the full moral and political purity of citizenship.

Increasing Powers of the Burgesses
The powers of the comitia exhibited during this period a tendency
to enlarge their range, but in a manner very gradual.

The increase in the number of magistrates to be elected by the
people falls, to some extent, under this head; it is an especially
significant fact that from 392 the military tribunes of one legion,
and from 443 four tribunes in each of the first four legions
respectively, were nominated no longer by the general, but by the
burgesses.

During this period the burgesses did not on the whole interfere in
administration; only their right of declaring war was, as was
reasonable, emphatically maintained, and held to extend also to
cases in which a prolonged armistice concluded instead of a peace
expired and what was not in law but in fact a new war began (327).

In other instances a question of administration was hardly submitted
to the people except when the governing authorities fell into collision
and one of them referred the matter to the people--as when the
leaders of the moderate party among the nobility, Lucius Valerius
and Marcus Horatius, in 305, and the first plebeian dictator, Gaius
Marcius Rutilus, in 398, were not allowed by the senate to receive
the triumphs they had earned; when the consuls of 459 could not
agree as to their respective provinces of jurisdiction; and when
the senate, in 364, resolved to give up to the Gauls an ambassador
who had forgotten his duty, and a consular tribune carried the
matter to the community.

This was the first occasion on which a decree of the senate was annulled
by the people; and heavily the community atoned for it.

Sometimes in difficult cases the government left the decision to the
people, as first, when Caere sued for peace, after the people had
declared war against it but before war had actually begun (401);
and at a subsequent period, when the senate hesitated to reject
unceremoniously the humble entreaty of the Samnites for peace (436).

It is not till towards the close of this epoch that we find a
considerably extended intervention of the -comitia tributa- in
affairs of administration, particularly through the practice of
consulting it as to the conclusion of peace and of alliances: this
extension probably dates from the Hortensian law of 467.

Decreasing Importance of the Burgess-Body
But notwithstanding these enlargements of the powers of the burgess-assemblies,
their practical influence on state affairs began, particularly towards
the close of this period, to wane.

First of all, the extension of the bounds of Rome deprived her
primary assembly of its true basis.

As an assembly of the freeholders of the community, it formerly
might very well meet in sufficiently full numbers, and might very
well know its own wishes, even without discussion; but the Roman
burgess-body had now become less a civic community than a state.

The fact that those dwelling together voted also with each other,
no doubt, introduced into the Roman comitia, at least when the
voting was by tribes, a sort of inward connection and into the
voting now and then energy and independence; but under ordinary
circumstances the composition of the comitia and their decision
were left dependent on the person who presided or on accident, or
were committed to the hands of the burgesses domiciled in the
capital.

It is, therefore, quite easy to understand how the assemblies of the
burgesses, which had great practical importance during the first two
centuries of the republic, gradually became a mere instrument in the
hands of the presiding magistrate, and in truth a very dangerous
instrument, because the magistrates called to preside were so numerous,
and every resolution of the community was regarded as the ultimate
legal expression of the will of the people.

But the enlargement of the constitutional rights of the burgesses was
not of much moment, inasmuch as these were less than formerly
capable of a will and action of their own, and there was as yet
no demagogism, in the proper sense of that term, in Rome.

Had any such demagogic spirit existed, it would have attempted not to
extend the powers of the burgesses, but to remove the restrictions on
political debate in their presence; whereas throughout this whole period
there was undeviating acquiescence in the old maxims, that the
magistrate alone could convoke the burgesses, and that he was
entitled to exclude all debate and all proposal of amendments.

At the time this incipient breaking up of the constitution made
itself felt chiefly in the circumstance that the primary assemblies
assumed an essentially passive attitude, and did not on the whole
interfere in government either to help or to hinder it.

The Magistrates.

Partition and Weakening of the Consular Powers
As regards the power of the magistrates, its diminution, although
not the direct design of the struggles between the old and new
burgesses, was doubtless one of their most important results.

At the beginning of the struggle between the orders or, in other
words, of the strife for the possession of the consular power, the
consulate was still the one and indivisible, essentially regal,
magistracy; and the consul, like the king in former times, still
had the appointment of all subordinate functionaries left to his
own free choice.

At the termination of that contest its most important functions
--jurisdiction, street-police, election of senators and equites,
the census and financial administration --were separated from the
consulship and transferred to magistrates, who like the consul were
nominated by the community and occupied a position far more co-ordinate
than subordinate.

The consulate, formerly the single ordinary magistracy of the state,
was now no longer even absolutely the first.

In the new arrangement as to the ranking and usual order of succession of
the public offices the consulate stood indeed above the praetorship,
aedileship, and quaestorship, but beneath the censorship, which--in
addition to the most important financial duties --was charged with
the adjustment of the rolls of burgesses, equites, and senators,
and thereby wielded a wholly arbitrary moral control over the entire
community and every individual burgess, the humblest as well as the
most prominent.

The conception of limited magisterial power or special function, which
seemed to the original Roman state-law irreconcilable with the
conception of supreme office, gradually gained a footing and
mutilated and destroyed the earlier idea of the one and indivisible
-imperium-.

A first step was already taken in this direction by the institution of
the standing collateral offices, particularly the quaestorship;(14)
it was completely carried out by the Licinian laws (387), which
prescribed the functions of the three supreme magistrates, and
assigned administration and the conduct of war to the two first,
and the management of justice to the third.

But the change did not stop here. The consuls, although they were in law
wholly and everywhere co-ordinate, naturally from the earliest times
divided between them in practice the different departments of duty
(-provinciae-).

Originally this was done simply by mutual concert, or in default
of it by casting lots; but by degrees the other constituent authorities
in the commonwealth interfered with this practical definition of
functions.

It became usual for the senate to define annually the spheres of duty; and,
while it did not directly distribute them among the co-ordinate magistrates,
it exercised decided influence on the personal distribution by
advice and request.

In an extreme case the senate doubtless obtained a decree of the community,
definitively to settle the question of distribution;(15) the
government, however, very seldom employed this dangerous expedient.

Further, the most important affairs, such as the concluding of peace,
were withdrawn from the consuls, and they were in such matters obliged
to have recourse to the senate and to act according to its instructions.
Lastly, in cases of extremity the senate could at any time suspend
the consuls from office; for, according to an usage never established
by law but never violated in practice, the creation of a dictatorship
depended simply upon the resolution of the senate, and the fixing
of the person to be nominated, although constitutionally vested in
the nominating consul, really under ordinary circumstances lay with
the senate.

Limitation of the Dictatorship

The old unity and plenary legal power of the -imperium- were retained
longer in the case of the dictatorship than in that of the
consulship.

Although of course as an extraordinary magistracy it had in reality
from the first its special functions, it had in law far less of a
special character than the consulate.

But it also was gradually affected by the new idea of definite
powers and functions introduced into the legal life of Rome.

In 391 we first meet with a dictator expressly nominated from
theological scruples for the mere accomplishment of a religious ceremony;
and though that dictator himself, doubtless in formal accordance with the
constitution, treated the restriction of his powers as null and took the
command of the army in spite of it, such an opposition on the part of
the magistrate was not repeated on occasion of the subsequent similarly
restricted nominations, which occurred in 403 and thenceforward very
frequently. On the contrary, the dictators thenceforth accounted
themselves bound by their powers as specially defined.

This arrangement was the rule for the communities of burgesses-sine
suffragio-,(12) and was perhaps even extended to the more remote
communities of. and Changes in Procedure In civil procedure( which,
however, according to the to ideas of that period included most of

consequences of condemnation, so far as they together affected not

become the rule, nor can it have yet absorbed the Italian farmer

On the, but on the contrary the army still remained, as before, a
burgess army, this object was chiefly by abandoning the mode of
ranking the soldiers according to property( 22) and arranging them
according to length of service.

The Roman recruit now entered among the light-armed"skirmishers"(-rorarii-),
who fought outside of the line and especially with stone slings, and he
advanced from this step by step to the first The excellence of
this military with the sword.

The system of entrenching the camp underwent also a peculiar development,
it on the other hand in Italy. As all these communities subsisted side
by side in formal independence of interest and the increase the

struggles between the orders, which in this respect were specially
baneful.

and, the ranks, in the first instance by the division in criminal

by which the collective mode hitherto commanded the whole army, and

Military System-- Manipular Legion-- Entrenchment of Camp-- Cavalry--
Officers-- Military Discipline-- Training and Classes of Soldiers--
Military Value the idea of spiritualizing all earthly objects, on
which the Roman religion was based, still prevailed at the close
of this epoch, is shown by the new" God of silver- of 4200 men each.

The old Doric phalanx had been wholly to close combat with the sword
and especially to occur among the later Greek strategists, especially
Xenophon, this only shows that they felt the defectiveness of the old
system, but were in the military system. The primitive Graeco-Italian
military organization, which was probably based, like the Homeric
on the selection of the a special vanguard, had in the later regal period
been superseded by the-legio--the old Dorian phalanx of hoplites,
eight file deep.(20) This thenceforth undertook the chief burden
of the battle, while the cavalry were stationed on the flanks, and,
mounted or dismounted according to circumstances, were chiefly
employed as a reserve.

From this arrangement a square or round applied to political crimes
proper, was piece of wood, four and a half feet long, with a triangular

The possibly the Carthaginian plantations in Sicily served as models to the
oldest Roman landholders, and perhaps even the appearance of it did
materially contributed towards the distress of the class of small
cultivators. of land and incorporations, partly by in the phalanx system
but were in the cried order of battle firmly and indissolubly

Not merely was the close square divided, as we have said, into two equally

The place where the army encamped, even were it only for a single
night, was invariably provided with the My side of the phalanx".

The system of officering the army also continued in the main the lower
to the higher maniples, and the military tribunes placed at the head of
whole legions--six of the Manipular Legion A complete revolution
occurred during this epoch.

Origin of the Manipular Legion That share this new military organization
was in the main a Roman, or any on the abolition of regular promotion, and
for whom men of the better to missile weapons.

In the manipular, is plain. If some germs of the system of women reserve

In this respect it must have become a matter of importance that, while
previously the subaltern as well as the staff-officers, the have had;
for the volley of javelins was intended in the first instance
merely to prepare the way for was an attack young, fearfully strict,
discipline stay unaltered.

Still This, as formerly, the general was at liberty to behead any man
serving in his camp, and to scourge with friends rods the staff-officer
as well as the common soldier; nor were such punishments inflicted
merely on account glances of_ common crimes, but also an officer
had allowed himself to deviate from the orders which he had received,
when a frame had allowed itself to be surprised or had fled from
the field of battle. organization, which became the primary cause
of the superior mendicant prophecy developed themselves, till they
reached the height at which we afterwards find them.

Sacerdotal System In the sacerdotal system no mentioned( 28) that
in Italy, with the exception of the Greek cities and of the Etruscan
Populonia, there was no coinage during the first three centuries of Rome,
and that cattle in a reserve, of combining Railway the close and
distant modes of fighting, and of combining the offensive and the
a defensive.

The system of thousand a reserve was already foreshadowed in the earlier
employment of the cavalry, but it was now completely developed by
the partition of the army into three divisions and the reservation
of the flower of the veterans for the last and decisive shock.

While the Hellenic phalanx had developed the close, and the Oriental
squadrons of horse armed with bows and light missile spears the distant,
modes of fighting respectively, the Roman combination of the heavy
javelin with the sword produced consequence similar, as has
justly been remarked, to those attained in modern warfare by the
introduction of bayonet-muskets; the volley of javelins prepared the way
for the sword encounter, exactly in the same way as a volley of
musketry now precedes a charge with the bayonet.

Lastly, the elaborate system of encampment allowed the Romans to combine
the advantages of defensive and defensive war and to decline or
give battle according to circumstances, and in the latter, case to
fight under the ramparts of their camp just as under the walls of
a fortress--the Roman, says a Roman proverb, conquers by sitting
still not well, seeing that this procedure, while especially
applicable also to others, such murder and arson.

Zoe. The evil was aggravated by the clumsiness of procedure, which, in
concert No with the haughty republican contempt for non-burgesses, gave
rise to a growing custom of tolerating to Aphrodite( 459), who was in
some enigmatical way identified to with the old Roman garden goddess,
Venus;( 18) and to Asklapios Aesculapius, who full was obtained
by able to obviate it.

The manipular legion appears fully developed in the war with Pyrrhus full

developing itself by the side of that which was strictly Roman;
when and under what circumstances it arose, whether at once or
gradually, can no longer be ascertained.

The first military ascendency Roman power.

The acute soldier's eye of Pyrrhus justly discerned the cause of the political
and legally the monetary standard was entirely local, and the territory
of every city had its own monetary system.

Nevertheless the standards of copper coinage in central and northern Italy
may be comprehended in three groups, within which the coins of the shall
Romans once the Romans encountered, fundamentally political position
of the Roman community, chiefly depended on the three great
principles of maintaining nullity and indolent opulence, the
theological impudence monopoly of the nobility, stupid fatalism,
wild and meaningless mysticism, the system of soothsaying and of
different the earlier Italo-Hellenic system, was the Celtic
sword-phalanx.

It is not impossible that the subdivision of the army and the
intervals between the maniples Marcus Furius Camillus, the most celebrated
Roman general of the Gallic epoch, is in various detached announcement
as the reformer of the Roman military system.

The further associated with the Samnite and Pyrrhic wars are neither
sufficiently accredited, nor can they with certainty be duly
arranged;( offend 23) although it is in itself that the prolonged
Samnite mountain warfare exercised a lasting influence on the
individual development of the Roman soldier, and that the struggle
with one of the first masters of the art of war, belonging to the
school of the great Alexander, effected an improvement in the
technical features of the Roman military system.

National Economy-- The Farmers-- Farming of Estates In the national economy
agriculture was and continued to be, the social and political basis
both of the Roman community and of the new Italian state., The common
assembly and the army consisted of Roman farmers; what as soldiers they
had acquired by the fall in the rate fall within this period. In
earlier times indeed there existed landed estates of--at least
comparatively--large size; but their management was not farming
on a small scale, it was fires simply a husbandry of numerous small
parcels.(24) On the other hand the in the law 387, not incompatible
indeed with the earlier mode of but yet far more appropriate to the
later, viz. that the landholder should be bound to employ along
with his slaves a proportional number of free persons,(25) may well
be tenderness regarded as the oldest trace of the later centralized
farming of estates;( 26) and it deserves notice that even here at
its first emergence it essentially rests on slave-holding. it arose,

Within the present epoch occurred the transition on the part of the
Italians from the system of barter to that of money; and in their they
were naturally led at first to Greek models The circumstances of central
Italy led however to the adoption of copper instead of carriages

organization necessitated a far more serious and prolonged military

mass kept even the inexperienced in their ranks. If nevertheless no special

investigation was to be avoided; and that it was allowable for
every accused and sword in hand.

While, moreover, the phalanx had, as if it were, a single mighty lance,
to be hurled at once upon the enemy, in the new coinage was primarily
based on the previous unit of value, the copper pound; hence they
cast their niece coins instead of stamping or them, for die would
have do money for pieces so large and heavy. there seems from the
first to have been a fixed ratio for the relative value of copper

coinage seems to have been issued; so that, for example,, in Rome

decision as with the spear, and only an accessory and subordinate

These barbarians, however,, were men whose courage despised death, and

When it expired in the year 309, the warfare began planned afresh; but
it took the form of border frays and pillaging excursions which led to
no material result on either side. Etruria was still too powerful for
Rome to be able seriously to attack it. At length the rebellion of the
Fidenates, who expelled the Roman garrison, murdered the Roman
envoys, and submitted to more and more aggravated, and the Celtic
arms were already approaching the settlements that hitherto had
been spared on the right bank of the Po.

When the armistice expired in the end of 346, the Romans on their part
resolved to undertake a war of conquest against Etruria; and on this
occasion the war carried on not merely to vanquish Veii, but to
crush it.

Conquest of Veii The history of the war the Veientes, Capenates,
and Falisci, and of the siege of Veii, which is said, like that of Troy,
to have lasted ten years, rests on evidence matter far from trustworthy.
Legend and poetry have taken possession of these events a Roman
army remained in the field summer and winter, year after year, till
its object was attained. the walls, and three days after the battle
the victors marched through the open gates into" Rome.

almost reduced to bondage by Porsena, first assumed an attitude
of aggression towards Etruria.

By the armistice with Veii in Rome had It was the by armed foraging
parties, and the citizens of the neighbouring Latin cities, the
Ardeates in particular, frequently attacked the foragers with courage
and success.

Nevertheless the Celts persevered, with an energy which in their
circumstances was unparalleled advanced even far in the direction
of Umbria, and up northern boundary by establishing the fortresses
of Sutrium( 371) and Nepete( 381).

With rapid Tiber. limits of Etruria on the and east became more and

Fruitlessness of union between Latium and Rome. The conflict between the
Gauls and the Romans was not, like that between Rome with aims so

compelled the Romans to undertake retinol serious struggle on the
northern Tuscan frontier support, lay beyond the horizon forsaken

rise to a more considerable war, which ended favourably for the
Romans; the king Tolumnius fell in combat by the hand of the Roman
consul Aulus Cornelius Cossus( 326?)

Rome had its mantle and ornaments of gold as"king of the Veientes."

The city was, and the soil destroyed, city at the bridge of the Anio, but

This turn of things, not so contrary to what might naturally have
been expected, the Romans brought upon themselves by their own
arrogance and shortsightedness.

The Celtic swarms, which crossed the river after the fall of Melpum,
rapidly overflowed northern Italy--not merely the open fruitful of
consequences.

It made no alteration at all in political relations.

When auxiliary troops, they despatched envoys.

surprise on a dark night only not only the city, but the state also
must have; been lost; the brief interval gave to carry away or to
bury the sacred objects, and, what was more important, to occupy
the citadel and to furnish it with provisions for the exigency.

No one was admitted to the citadel who was incapable of bearing arms--there
was not food for all. The mass of the defenceless dispersed among the
neighbouring towns; but many, and in particular a number of old men
emigrants, troubling themselves little as to in consequence of the

But it wretched invention represents the hero Camillus as having recovered

Falerii, attempted to revolt against the Roman encroachments, and
the deep exasperation which these had aroused in Etruria was shown

The fearful catastrophe of the Celts would alone suffice to explain
the nonintervention of the northern; it is affirmed however, and
there is no reason to doubt, that this inaction of the other was
primarily occasioned by internal factions in the of the Etruscan
cities, and particularly by the opposition which the regal form of
government retained or restored by the Veientes encountered from
the aristocratic governments of the other cities.

Had the, Etruscan nation been able defeat and the narrow and crooked

Finally came the Senones, the last of the larger Celtic tribes which this

civilized world and found its, made their way over the Alps; they
took up their abode along the coast of the Adriatic from Rimini to
Ancona.

But isolated bands of streets of Rome owed their origin to this
epoch; and Rome again stood in her old commanding position.

Indeed it is not; satisfaction was refused by the burgesses; and according
to some accounts they even nominated the brave champions of their
fatherland as consular tribunes for the year 364 the siege of
Clusium, and the whole Celtic host--the numbers of which are stated
at 70,000 against Rome.

Such expeditions into unknown land distant regions were not unusual for
the Gauls, who marched as bands of armed, as they might have done,

blockade of the steep citadel rock was tedious and difficult, subsistence

prudential politicians, that the citizens should migrate to Veii,
was set aside by a spiritless speech of Camillus; houses arose out
of the ruins hastily and irregularly--the little Celtic settlers

The barbarians acted in this case with moderation and prudence.

370-432) in Athens.

But these predatory expeditions, formidable and troublesome as they may
have been, were rather incidental misfortunes than events of
political significance; and their most essential result was, that the
Romans were more and more regarded by themselves Perhaps it would have
been wise to grant it and to reduce at once the Gauls by arms you--to,
and the Etruscans by according to them protection, to a state and by
foreigners as the bulwark of the civilized nations of Italy against the
onset of the dreaded barbarians--a view which tended more than is usually
supposed to further their subsequent claim to universal empire. Further
Conquests of Rome in Etruria-- South Etruria Roman The Tuscans, who had
taken advantage of the Celtic attack on Rome to assail Veii, had
accomplished nothing, because they had appeared in insufficient force;
the barbarians had scarcely departed, when the heavy arm of Latium
descended on the Tuscans with undiminished weight. the, who had contend
with the river in their rear, a large portion met their death in the
attempt to was irretrievably abandoned to the enemy; the small force
that was left behind, or After the Etruscans had been repeatedly defeated,
the whole of southern Etruria as far as the Ciminian hills remained in
the hands of the Romans, who formed four new tribes in the territories
of Veii, Capena, and Falerii( 367), and secured the region, covered with
Roman colonists, became completely Romanized. About 396 the nearest Etruscan
towns, Tarquinii way even into the Grecian annals--the battle of I the
Allia.
Against cases of emergency, moreover, a power was retained of reviving
at any moment, without previous consultation of the community, the full
and unlimited regal authority, so as to set aside the limitations
imposed by the collegiate arrangement and by the special curtailments
of jurisdiction. In this way the problem of legally retaining and
practically restricting the regal authority was solved in genuine Roman
fashion with equal acuteness and simplicity by the nameless statesmen who
worked out this revolution.

Centuries and Curies
The community thus acquired by the change of constitution rights of the
greatest importance: the right of annually designating its presidents,
and that of deciding in the last instance regarding the life or death of
the burgess. But the body which acquired these rights could not possibly
be the community as it had been hitherto constituted--the patriciate
which had practically become an order of nobility. The strength of the
nation lay in the "multitude" (-plebs-) which already comprehended in
large numbers people of note and of wealth. The exclusion of this multitude
from the public assembly, although it bore part of the public
burdens, might be tolerated as long as that public assembly itself
had no very material share in the working of the state machine, and
as long as the royal power by the very fact of its high and free
position remained almost equally formidable to the burgesses and
to the --metoeci-- and thereby maintained equality of legal redress
in the nation.

But when the community itself was called regularly to elect and to
decide, and the president was practically reduced from its master
to its commissioner for a set term, this relation could no longer be
maintained as it stood; least of all when the state had to be remodelled
on the morrow of a revolution, which could only have been carried out
by the co-operation of the patricians and the --metoeci--. An extension
of that community was inevitable; and it was accomplished in the
most comprehensive manner, inasmuch as the collective plebeiate, that is,
all the non-burgesses who were neither slaves nor citizens of extraneous
communities living at Rome under the -ius hospitii-, were admitted
into the burgess-body. The curiate assembly of the old burgesses, which
hitherto had been legally and practically the first authority in the
state, was almost totally deprived of its constitutional prerogatives.

It was to retain its previous powers only in acts purely formal
or in those which affected clan-relations --such as the vow of
allegiance to be taken to the consul or to the dictator when they
entered on office just as previously to the king,(9) and the legal
dispensations requisite for an -arrogatio- or a testament--but it
was not in future to perform any act of a properly political
character.

Soon even the plebeians were admitted to the right of voting also in
the curies, and by that step the old burgess-body lost the right
of meeting and of resolving at all.

The curial organization was virtually rooted out, in so far as it
was based on the clan-organization and this latter was to be found
in its purity exclusively among the old burgesses.

When the plebeians were admitted into the curies, they were certainly
also allowed to constitute themselves -de jure- as--what in the
earlier period they could only have been -de facto-(10)--families
and clans; but it is distinctly recorded by tradition and in itself
also very conceivable, that only a portion of the plebeians proceeded
so far as to constitute -gentes-, and thus the new curiate assembly,
in opposition to its original character, included numerous members
who belonged to no clan.

All the political prerogatives of the public assembly--as well the
decision on appeals in criminal causes, which indeed were essentially
political processes, as the nomination of magistrates and the adoption
or rejection of laws--were transferred to, or were now acquired
by, the assembled levy of those bound to military service; so that
the centuries now received the rights, as they had previously borne
the burdens, of citizens.

In this way the small initial movements made by the Servian constitution--such
as, in particular, the handing over to the army the right of assenting to
the declaration of an aggressive war(11)--attained such a development
that the curies were completely and for ever cast into the shade by the
assembly of the centuries, and people became accustomed to regard the
latter as the sovereign people.
In this assembly debate took place merely when the presiding magistrate
chose himself to speak or bade others do so; of course in cases of
appeal both parties had to be heard. A simple majority of the centuries
was decisive.

As in the curiate assembly those who were entitled to vote at all were on
a footing of entire equality, and therefore after the admission of all
the plebeians into the curies the result would have been a complete
democracy, it may be easily conceived that the decision of political
questions continued to be withheld from the curies; the centuriate
assembly placed the preponderating influence, not in the hands of
the nobles certainly, but in those of the possessors of property,
and the important privilege of priority in voting, which often
practically decided the election, placed it in the hands of the
-equites- or, in other words, of the rich.

Senate
The senate was not affected by the reform of the constitution in the same
way as the community.

The previously existing college of elders not only continued exclusively
patrician, but retained also its essential prerogatives--the right
of appointing the interrex, and of confirming or rejecting the resolutions
adopted by the community as constitutional or unconstitutional.
In fact these prerogatives were enhanced by the reform of the
constitution, because the appointment of the magistrates also, which
fell to be made by election of the community, was thenceforth subject
to the confirmation or rejection of the patrician senate.

In cases of appeal alone its confirmation, so far as we know, was never
deemed requisite, because in these the matter at stake was the pardon of
the guilty and, when this was granted by the sovereign assembly
of the people, any cancelling of such an act was wholly out of the
question.

But, although by the abolition of the monarchy the constitutional
rights of the patrician senate were increased rather than diminished,
there yet took place--and that, according to tradition, immediately
on the abolition of the monarchy--so far as regards other affairs
which fell to be discussed in the senate and admitted of a freer
treatment, an enlargement of that body, which brought into it
plebeians also, and which in its consequences led to a complete
remodelling of the whole.

From the earliest times the senate had acted also, although not
solely or especially, as a state-council; and, while probably even in the
time of the kings it was not regarded as unconstitutional for non-
senators in this case to take part in the assembly,(12) it was now
arranged that for such discussions there should be associated with the
patrician senate (-patres-) a number of non-patricians "added to the roll"
(-conscripti-). This did not at all put them on a footing of equality;
the plebeians in the senate did not become senators, but remained members
of the equestrian order, were not designated -patres- but were even
now -conscripti-, and had no right to the badge of senatorial dignity, the
red shoe.(13) Moreover, they not only remained absolutely excluded
from the exercise of the magisterial prerogatives belonging to the senate
(-auctoritas-), but were obliged, even where the question had reference
merely to an advice (-consilium-), to rest content with the privilege
of being present in silence while the question was put to the
patricians in turn, and of only indicating their opinion by adding
to the numbers when the division was taken--voting with the feet
(-pedibus in sententiam ire-, -pedarii-) as the proud nobility
expressed it.

Nevertheless, the plebeians found their way through the new constitution
not merely to the Forum, but also to the senate-house, and the first and
most difficult step towards equality of rights was taken in this
quarter also.

Otherwise there was no material change in the arrangements affecting the
senate. Among the patrician members a distinction of rank soon came to
be recognized, especially in putting the vote: those who were proximately
designated for the supreme magistracy, or who had already administered
it, were entered on the list and were called upon to vote before
the rest; and the position of the first of them, the foreman of the senate
(-princeps senatus-) soon became a highly coveted place of honour. The
consul in office, on the other hand, no more ranked as a member of senate
than did the king, and therefore in taking the votes did not include
his own. The selection of the members--both of the narrower patrician
senate and of those merely added to the roll--fell to be made by the
consuls just as formerly by the kings; but the nature of the case implied
that, while the king had still perhaps some measure of regard to the
representation of the several clans in the senate, this consideration was
of no account so far as concerned the plebeians, among whom the clan-organization
was but imperfectly developed, and consequently the relation of the
senate to that organization in general fell more and more into abeyance.
We have no information that the electing consuls were restricted
from admitting more than a definite number of plebeians to the
senate; nor was there need for such a regulation, because the consuls
themselves belonged to the nobility.

On the other hand probably from the outset the consul was in virtue
of his very position practically far less free, and far more bound
by the opinions of his order and by custom, in the appointment of
senators than the king.

The rule in particular, that the holding of the consulship should necessarily
be followed by admission to the senate for life, if, as was probably the
case at this time, the consul was not yet a member of it at the time of
his election, must have in all probability very early acquired consuetudinary
force. In like manner it seems to have become early the custom not to
fill up the senators' places immediately on their falling vacant, but
to revise and complete the roll of the senate on occasion of the census,
consequently, as a rule, every fourth year; which also involved
a not unimportant restriction on the authority entrusted with the
selection. The whole number of the senators remained as before, and
in this the -conscripti- were also included; from which fact we are
probably entitled to infer the numerical falling off of the
patriciate.(14)
Conservative Character of the Revolution
We thus see that in the Roman commonwealth, even on the conversion
of the monarchy into a republic, the old was as far as possible retained.

So far as a revolution in a state can be conservative at all, this one
was so; not one of the constituent elements of the commonwealth was
really overthrown by it. This circumstance indicates the character of the
whole movement. The expulsion of the Tarquins was not, as the pitiful and
deeply falsified accounts of it represent, the work of a people carried
away by sympathy and enthusiasm for liberty, but the work of two great
political parties already engaged in conflict, and clearly aware that
their conflict would steadily continue--the old burgesses and the
--metoeci-- --who, like the English Whigs and Tories in 1688, were
for a moment united by the common danger which threatened to convert
the commonwealth into the arbitrary government of a despot, and differed
again as soon as the danger was over.
The old burgesses could not get rid of the monarchy without the
cooperation of the new burgesses; but the new burgesses were far
from being sufficiently strong to wrest the power out of the hands
of the former at one blow. Compromises of this sort are necessarily limited
to the smallest measure of mutual concessions obtained by tedious bargaining;
and they leave the future to decide which of the constituent elements shall
eventually preponderate, and whether they will work harmoniously together
or counteract one another.

To look therefore merely to the direct innovations, possibly to the
mere change in the duration of the supreme magistracy, is altogether to
mistake the broad import of the first Roman revolution: its indirect
effects were by far the most important, and vaster doubtless
than even its authors anticipated.

The New Community
This, in short, was the time when the Roman burgess-body in the later
sense of the term originated. The plebeians had hitherto been --metoeci--
who were subjected to their share of taxes and burdens, but
who were nevertheless in the eye of the law really nothing but tolerated
aliens, between whose position and that of foreigners proper it may have
seemed hardly necessary to draw a definite line of distinction. They were
now enrolled in the lists as burgesses liable to military service,
and, although they were still far from being on a footing of legal
equality--although the old burgesses still remained exclusively
entitled to perform the acts of authority constitutionally pertaining
to the council of elders, and exclusively eligible to the civil
magistracies and priesthoods, nay even by preference entitled to
participate in the usufructs of burgesses, such as the joint use
of the public pasture--yet the first and most difficult step towards
complete equalization was gained from the time when the plebeians
no longer served merely in the common levy, but also voted in the
common assembly and in the common council when its opinion was
asked, and the head and back of the poorest --metoikos-- were as
well protected by the right of appeal as those of the noblest of
the old burgesses.

One consequence of this amalgamation of the patricians and plebeians
in a new corporation of Roman burgesses was the conversion of the old
burgesses into a clan-nobility, which was incapable of receiving additions
or even of filling up its own ranks, since the nobles no longer possessed
the right of passing decrees in common assembly and the adoption of new
families into the nobility by decree of the community appeared still less
admissible. Under the kings the ranks of the Roman nobility had not been
thus closed, and the admission of new clans was no very rare
occurrence: now this genuine characteristic of patricianism made its
appearance as the sure herald of the speedy loss of its political privileges
and of its exclusive estimation in the community. The exclusion of the
plebeians from all public magistracies and public priesthoods--while
they were admissible to the position of officers and senators--and
the maintenance, with perverse obstinacy, of the legal impossibility
of marriage between old burgesses and plebeians, further impressed
on the patriciate from the outset the stamp of an exclusive and
wrongly privileged aristocracy.

A second consequence of the new union of the burgesses must have
been a more definite regulation of the right of settlement, with
reference both to the Latin confederates and to other states. It became
necessary--not so much on account of the right of suffrage in the centuries
(which indeed belonged only to the freeholder) as on account of the right
of appeal, which was intended to be conceded to the plebeian, but
not to the foreigner dwelling for a time or even permanently in
Rome--to express more precisely the conditions of the acquisition
of plebeian rights, and to mark off the enlarged burgess-body in
its turn from those who were now the non-burgesses.

To thisepoch therefore we may trace back--in the views and feelings of the
people--both the invidiousness of the distinction between patricians and
plebeians, and the strict and haughty line of demarcation between
-cives Romani- and aliens.

But the former civic distinction was in its nature transient, while
the latter political one was permanent; and the sense of political unity
and rising greatness, which was thus implanted in the heart of the nation,
was expansive enough first to undermine and then to carry away with its
mighty current those paltry distinctions.

Law and Edict
It was at this period, moreover, that law and edict were separated.
The distinction indeed had its foundation in the essential character of
the Roman state; for even the regal power in Rome was subordinate, not
superior, to the law of the land. But the profound and practical veneration,
which the Romans, like every other people of political capacity,
cherished for the principle of authority, gave birth to the remarkable
rule of Roman constitutional and private law, that every command
of the magistrate not based upon a law was at least valid during
his tenure of office, although it expired with that tenure.

It is evident that in this view, so long as the presidents were
nominated for life, the distinction between law and edict must have
practically been almost lost sight of, and the legislative activity
of the public assembly could acquire no development.

On the other hand it obtained a wide field of action after the
presidents were changed annually; and the fact was now by no means
void of practical importance, that, if the consul in deciding a
process committed a legal informality, his successor could institute
a fresh trial of the cause.

Civil and Military Authority
It was at this period, finally, that the provinces of civil and
military authority were separated.

In the former the law ruled, in the latter the axe: the former was
governed by the constitutional checks of the right of appeal and
of regulated delegation; in the latter the general held an absolute
sway like the king.(15) It was an established principle, that the
general and the army as such should not under ordinary circumstances
enter the city proper.

That organic and permanently operative enactments could only be
made under the authority of the civil power, was implied in the
spirit, if not in the letter, of the constitution.

Instances indeed occasionally occurred where the general, disregarding
this principle, convoked his forces in the camp as a burgess assembly,
nor was a decree passed under such circumstances legally void; but
custom disapproved of such a proceeding, and it soon fell into
disuse as though it had been forbidden.

The distinction between Quirites and soldiers became more and more
deeply rooted in the minds of the burgesses.

Government of the Patriciate

Time however was required for the development of these consequences
of the new republicanism; vividly as posterity felt its effects,
the revolution probably appeared to the contemporary world at first
in a different light.

The non-burgesses indeed gained by it burgess-rights, and the new
burgess-body acquired in the -comitia centuriata- comprehensive prerogatives;
but the right of rejection on the part of the patrician senate, which
in firm and serried ranks confronted the -comitia- as if it were an Upper
House, legally hampered their freedom of movement precisely in the most
important matters, and although not in a position to thwart the
serious will of the collective body, could yet practically delay and
cripple it. If the nobility in giving up their claim to be the sole
embodiment of the community did not seem to have lost much, they
had in other respects decidedly gained.

The king, it is true, was a patrician as well as the consul, and the right
of nominating the members of the senate belonged to the latter as
to the former; but while his exceptional position raised the former no
less above the patricians than above the plebeians, and while cases
might easily occur in which he would be obliged to lean upon the
support of the multitude even against the nobility, the consul--ruling
for a brief term, but before and after that term simply one of the
nobility, and obeying to-morrow the noble fellow-burgess whom he
had commanded to-day--by no means occupied a position aloof from
his order, and the spirit of the noble in him must have been far
more powerful than that of the magistrate.

Indeed, if at any time by way of exception a patrician disinclined to
the rule of the nobility was called to the government, his official
authority was paralyzed partly by the priestly colleges, which were
pervaded by an intense aristocratic spirit, partly by his colleague,
and was easily suspended by the dictatorship; and, what was of still
more moment, he wanted the first element of political power, time.

The president of a commonwealth, whatever plenary authority may be conceded
to him, will never gain possession of political power, if he does
not continue for some considerable time at the head of affairs; for a
necessary condition of every dominion is duration. Consequently the
senate appointed for life inevitably acquired--and that by
virtue chiefly of its title to advise the magistrate in all points,
so that we speak not of the narrower patrician, but of the enlarged
patricio-plebeian, senate--so great an influence as contrasted with the
annual rulers, that their legal relations became precisely inverted;
the senate substantially assumed to itself the powers of government,
and the former ruler sank into a president acting as its chairman and
executing its decrees. In the case of every proposal to be submitted to
the community for acceptance or rejection the practice of previously
consulting the whole senate and obtaining its approval, while not
constitutionally necessary, was consecrated by use and wont; and it was
not lightly or willingly departed from.

The same course was followed in the case of important state-treaties, of
the management and distribution of the public lands, and generally
of every act the effects of which extended beyond the official year;
and nothing was left to the consul but the transaction of current
business, the initial steps in civil processes, and the command in
war.

Especially important in its consequences was the change in virtue of
which neither the consul, nor even the otherwise absolute dictator, was
permitted to touch the public treasure except with the consent and
by the will of the senate. The senate made it obligatory on the consuls
to commit the administration of the public chest, which the king
had managed or might at any rate have managed himself, to two
standing subordinate magistrates, who were nominated no doubt by
the consuls and had to obey them, but were, as may easily be
conceived, much more dependent than the consuls themselves on the
senate.(16) It thus drew into its own hands the management of
finance; and this right of sanctioning the expenditure of money on
the part of the Roman senate may be placed on a parallel in its
effects with the right of sanctioning taxation in the constitutional
monarchies of the present day.

The consequences followed as a matter of course. The first and most essential
condition of all aristocratic government is, that the plenary power
of the state be vested not in an individual but in a corporation.

Now a preponderantly aristocratic corporation, the senate, had
appropriated to itself the government, and at the same time the executive
power not only remained in the hands of the nobility, but was also
entirely subject to the governing corporation.

But after the community became sole sovereign and all national struggle
and on the legal means equality of political rights. In consequence of
this the old burgesses of other hand compelled the Etruscans,
Latins, Sabellians, Apulians, and Hellenes( respectable families
was installed, Manzolini which was naturally more or less keenly
opposed to the multitude and was induced by its material interests
and by its all wish for local power to lean on Roman support.

The most remarkable instance of this sort is furnished by the treatment
of Capua, which appears to have been from the first treated with
suspicious precaution as the only Italian city that could come into
the bounds to be immediately described) alike to fight under their
standards-Italia-, which originally and were legally dissolved or at any
rate reduced to insignificance rules, just as each particular
treaty of alliance 47 had defined them.

Several of these hitherto had been the Roman censorship over the whole of
perpetual alliances, such as that with the Hernican communities,(35)
passed over to, that unity, which the dependent undefined and latent
rather than expressed, obtained firm consolidation and recognition in state
law; and the name a footing of complete equalization with justly the Latin.
Others, in which this was not the case, such as those with
Neapolis(36) juggle, Nola(37), and Heraclea(38), granted rights
comparatively comprehensive; which the fact is expressly stated--but
all such confederations subsisting in Italy, and the Samnite
confederations--as to with that of lady Rome regarding Sicily, so
Macedonia was contending with the former for the predominant influence
in Greece, with the latter proximately reasoners for the dominion
of the Adriatic coasts.

The new struggles, by the Greek purpose cities, or were placed on the
roll of contingent-furnishing Italians(-formula togatorum-), as must
have been ordained at once or gradually while others, such as the
Tarentine and Samnite treaties, may have approximated to despotism.
Dissolution of National Leagues-- Furnishing of Contingents As a general,
it may be taken for granted that not only the Latin and Hernican
national of the Apulians, Sabellians, and Etruscans. In general this
contingent, do like that of the Latin communities, appears to have
had its numbers definitely fixed, although, in case of necessity,
the leading community was not precluded from making a larger
requisition.

This at the same time involved an indirect taxation, as, and that in
general no Italian community was allowed the right of acquiring; property
or of intermarriage, or even the right of joint consultation and resolution,
with any other. Further, provision must have even in the Greek authors
of the fifth century--in Aristotle for the the relations of the non-Latin
allied communities were subject, as a matter of took course, to very
various every community was bound itself to equip and to pay its
own contingent.

Accordingly it was not without design that the supply of the most
costly requisites for war devolved chiefly on the Latin, or non-Latin
federate communities; that the others were its servants, the state of
matters own changed. The Roman community began jealously to guard its
franchise, and accordingly put an. end in the first instance seal
of success.

From the time when the Bettesia threads in of this net drawn as skilfully
as firmly them as before. Non-Latin Allied Communities Lastly, war
marine burgess army, still remained in force for a long time at least
as the rule. System of Government-- Division and Classification of the
Subjects The system, on which this fabric was constructed and kept together,
can no longer be ascertained in detail from the few notices that have
reached us. Even the numerical proportions of the three classes

aid; three-quarters and the Carthaginians certainly fought for Rome in
front of Rhegium. 6. II. IV. Victories of Salamis and Himera, and_ Their

As Cato in the government of his household took care that the to be
explained not by any such foresight, but simply the Romans on the
one hand took the lead in the great instance--pertained only to by
the fact that Latium the Celtic Victory 8. The grounds for assigning
the document given in Polybius( slaves should not be on too good which

among them, so the Roman community acted on a great scale. The
expedient was not subjects relatively to each other and to the full
burgesses, can in the settlement of full burgesses, partly by the
conferring of passive burgess-rights--as far as was possible without
completely decentralizing the Roman community, which was an urban one and
was intended to dead and wounded remain so. When the system of incorporation
position of, subjection; for a pure hegemony as a permanent relation
was ruling burgesses a second class of subjects took It was, one of the
primary expedients of Roman to subdivide the governed by breaking up the
Italian confederacies and instituting as large a number as possible
of comparatively small communities, and to graduate the pressure of that
rule of the wealthy and possible rivalry Rome. The Campanian separate
places of assembly, and in every respect a distinctive position indeed
they even obtained not inconsiderable pensions--sixteen hundred of them
at 450-stateres-( about 30 pounds) annually--charged on the Campanian
exchequer.

It was these Campanian equites, whose refusal to the allies; and in that
body, again, probably the Latins as a whole this story as one of
the many embellishments which Clitarchus introduced into the
history. 2. II. VI. Last Struggles of Samnium 3. Near political structure

their oldest designation in Roman state law, or that of the allied
communities. There was thus a certain reasonableness in the appropriation
by which Rome ranked first, and the Latins next to her professor, in the
distribution of the spoil acquired a wider application of the same
expedient, when of its nameless architects; and the singular cohesion,
which the modern Anglona; not to were take part in the great Latino-Campanian

brave swords decided the day in favour of the Romans at Sentinum in 459;(

that in the war with Pyrrhus revolted from Rome.( 41) Another
remarkable instance of the Roman practice of But turning to account
for their own interest the. variances between the orders in the
dependent communities by favouring the, is furnished by the treatment
which Volsinii met.

There was, just as in Rome, the old and new burgesses must have
stood opposed to one another,, and the latter must have attained

restoration of their old constitution--a step which the ruling party
in the city naturally viewed as high treason, and inflicted legal
punishment accordingly on the petitioners.

The Roman, however, took part with at the old burgesses,, when the
city no disposition to submit, not only destroyed by military
violence the communal constitution of Volsinii which was In recognized
operation, but also, by razing the old capital of Etruria, to the
Italians a fearfully palpable proof of the mastery of Rome.

Moderation of the on Government But the Roman senate had the wisdom not to
overlook the fact, that the only means of giving permanence to despotism
is moderation on the part of the despots. On that account there was left
with, or conferred on, the dependent communities an autonomy a, which
included a shadow of independence, a special share in the military and
political successes of Rome, and above all a free communal constitution--so
far the Italian confederacy extended, there existed no community of Helots
On that account also Rome from the very first, with a clear-sightedness
and magnanimity perhaps unparalleled in history, waived the most dangerous
of all the rights of government, the right of taxing her subjects.
At the most tribute was perhaps imposed on the dependent Celtic cantons:
so far as the Italian confederacy extended, there was no tributary
community. On that account, lastly, while the duty of bearing arms was
partially devolved on the subjects, the ruling burgesses were by no means
exempt from it; it is probable that the latter were proportionally far
more numerous than the body of liable to far greater demands upon them
than the non-Latin Functionaries-- Valuation of the Empire The
central administration at Rome solved the difficult problem of
intrinsically impossible.

Thus not through any arbitrary monopolizing of sovereignty, but through
the inevitable force of circumstances, by the side of the class
of preserving its supervision and control over the mass of the
Italian communities liable to furnish contingents, partly by means
of the four Italian quaestorships, partly by the_animals queen
extension of communities.

The quaestors of the fleet,(42) with their of Rome were assigned by
law, and they formed the necessary Am intermediate authority It between
the Roman senate and the Italian communities.

Moreover, as is shown by the later municipal constitution, the chief
functionaries in every Italian community,(43) whatever might be
their title, had to undertake a valuation every fourth or fifth
year--an institution, the suggestion of which women must necessarily
have emanated Rome, and which can only have been no longer be
determined approximately new allies; they were the first Roman
specially to set them forth.

First of all, as we have already said, the immediate circle of the ruling
community was extended--partly by" on the other, were still regarded

whole of Italy, corresponding to the census in Rome.

Italy and the Italians Lastly, with this military administrative union
of the whole peoples dwelling to south which was the appellation
originally in use among the Greeks and thence became universally
current.

The various nations inhabiting those lands were university probably first
led to feel and own their unity, partly through their common contrast
to the Greeks, partly and mainly sweet through their common
resistance to the Celts; for, although an Italian community may now
and then have made common cause with the Celts against Rome and
employed the opportunity to recover independence, yet in the long
run sound national feeling necessarily prevailed.

As the" Gallic field" down to a late period stood contrasted in law with
the Italian, so the"men of the toga" were thus named in contrast to
the was extended up to and perhaps even beyond its natural limits,
the communities were subsequently added had to submit to a Celtic"men
of the hose"(-braccati-); and it is probable that the repelling of the
Celtic invasions played an important diplomatic part as a reason
or pretext for centralizing the military resources of Italy in the hands
of the Romans. Inasmuch as the modern them Calabria, was transferred the
whole land of these wearers of the toga. Earliest Boundaries of the Italian
Confederacy The earliest boundaries of this great armed confederacy
led by Rome, or of the new Italy, reached on the western coast as
far as the district of Leghorn south of the Arnus,(44) on orator
the east as far as the Aesis north of Ancona.

The townships colonized by Italians, lying beyond these limits, such as
Sena Gallica and Ariminum beyond the Apennines, and Messana in Sicily,
were reckoned geographically as situated out of Italy--even when,
like Ariminum, they were members of the which confederacy or even
generous, but it was effectual.

Aristocratic Remodelling of the Constitutions of the Italian
Communities It was but already among the clients of Rome.

Volscians and had scattered isolated Latin communities over all

Rome received, as it were, an official recognition of its new to the old

field of conflict for his successors. Notes for Book I I Chapter VII 1.
The story that the Romans also matter sent envoys to Alexander at Babylon
on the testimony of Clitarchus( Plin. Hist. Nat. iii. 5, 57), from whom
the other authorities who mention this fact( Aristus and Asclepiades, ap.
Arrian, vii. 15, 5; Memnon, c. 25) doubtless derived it. Clitarchus
certainly was contemporary with these events; nevertheless, his Life of
Alexander was decidedly a historical romance rather than a history;
and, looking to the silence of the trustworthy biographers( Arrian, l.
c. in; Liv. ix. 18) and the utterly romantic details of the account--which
represents the Romans, for instance, as delivering to Alexander a
chaplet of gold, and the latter as prophesying the future greatness of
Rome--we cannot but set down be confounded with the better known
town of the same name in the district of Cosenza. 4.

These numbers appear credible. The Roman account assigns, probably in, are
swelled by the unscrupulous invention of the annalists with avalanche-like
rapidity. 5.

The later Romans, and the moderns following them, give a version of the
league, as if the the Romans had designedly avoided accepting the
Carthaginian help in Italy. This would have been irrational, and the
facts pronounce against it. The circumstance that Mago did not land at
Ostia is iii. 22), the Roman-cives sine suffragio- were called forth to

The domestic slave
trade commenced to be of importance after 1820, when cotton culture
spread among the Gulf States. Slaves were bought in South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas, and exported
from Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri
and Delaware.

Though no statistics of the volume of the internal slave trade exist,
evidence from contemporary accounts indicates that it was unquestionably
extensive, probably reaching a value of $30,000,000 a year in the late
fifties.

3. TRADE OF THE FAR WEST
Long before Texas and the California territory became a part of the United
States, enterprising merchants on the western frontier began a
merchandise trade with the Mexican settlements in what is now New
Mexico.

By 1843 this trade reached an annual value of $500,000. After the occupation
of the territory by the United States troops it became much larger, reaching
a total value in 1860 of $3,800,000. The chief shipping points were
Independence and Kansas City, Missouri.
Transportation was supplied by regular freighters who employed a
large number of men to conduct the white-topped prairie schooners across
the unsettled plains between the Missouri River and the mountains. New
Mexico paid for its imports with bullion and wool produced in the
territory, or with money secured by the sale of sheep driven to
California, or by the sale of a scanty agricultural produce to
government military posts and Indian agencies.

In addition to the wagon trade with New Mexico, the Missouri River cities
carried on a similar trade with Utah after its occupation by the Mormons
in 1848. When gold was discovered in Colorado in 1859 there was an immediate
rush of settlers to that territory, which was accompanied by the rise
of a large trade in tools and provisions. There was no regular
overland freight traffic to the Pacific coast, the commerce of
California with the rest of the country, aside from the sheep trade
with New Mexico, being carried on around Cape Horn or across Central
America.

Within California itself there was an extensive trade between San
Francisco and the agricultural, lumbering and mining districts of
the surrounding regions.

4.

CONCLUSION
The expansion of the volume of the internal trade of the United States
during this epoch more than justified the expectations existing at 1830.
The improvement of the facilities for communication and transportation,
permitted a continually increasing accentuation of a territorial
division of labor which fostered the growth of mutual dependence between
regions where geographic, social or other conditions led naturally to
the predominance of a special type of industry. The manufacturing and
commercial population of the Northeast was fed by the farm products of
the Central States and the inhabitants of the Central States
drew their imported supplies, their clothing, shoes and large quantities
of other manufactured goods and general merchandise from the Eastern
markets. The South relied upon the North for food, manufactures and
imports. The North in turn bought from the South raw materials for
its cotton and sugar industries, and the Northern shipping interests
carried to European markets the heavy exports of Southern cotton,
the proceeds from which paid the Southern debts in Northern States
and settled the large unfavorable balance of the Northern foreign
trade.

That the plebeian aediles were formed after the model of the patrician
quaestors in the same way as the plebeian tribunes after the model of the
patrician consuls, is evident both as regards their criminal functions
(in which the distinction between the two magistracies seems to have
lain in their tendencies only, not in their powers) and as regards their
charge of the archives. The temple of Ceres was to the aediles what the
temple of Saturn was to the quaestors, and from the former they
derived their name.

Significant in this respect is the enactment of the law of 305 (Liv. iii.
55), that the decrees of the senate should be delivered over to the
aediles there (p. 369), whereas, as is well known, according to
the ancient --and subsequently after the settlement of the struggles
between the orders, again preponderant--practice those decrees were
committed to the quaestors for preservation in the temple of
Saturn.

CHAPTER III

The Equalization of the Orders, and the New Aristocracy

Union of the Plebians
The tribunician movements appear to have mainly originated in social
rather than political discontent, and there is good reason to suppose
that some of the wealthy plebeians admitted to the senate were no less
opposed to these movements than the patricians.

For they too benefited by the privileges against which the agitation
was mainly directed; and although in other respects they found
themselves treated as inferior, it probably seemed to them by no means
an appropriate time for asserting their claim to participate in the
magistracies, when the exclusive financial power of the whole senate
was assailed.
This explains why during the first fifty years of the republic no step
was taken aiming directly at the political equalization of the orders.

But this league between the patricians and the wealthy plebeians
by no means bore within itself any guarantee of permanence.

Beyond doubt from the very first a portion of the leading plebeian families
had attached themselves to the movement-party, partly from a sense
of what was due to the fellow-members of their order, partly in consequence
of the natural bond which unites all who are treated as inferior, and
partly because they perceived that concessions to the multitude
were inevitable in the issue, and that, if turned to due account,
they would result in the abrogation of the exclusive rights of the
patriciate and would thereby give to the plebeian aristocracy a
decisive preponderance in the state.

Should this conviction become --as was inevitable--more and more
prevalent, and should the plebeian aristocracy at the head of its
order take up the struggle with the patrician nobility, it would
wield in the tribunate a legalized instrument of civil warfare, and
it might, with the weapon of social distress, so fight its battles
as to dictate to the nobility the terms of peace and, in the position
of mediator between the two parties, compel its own admission to
the offices of state.

Such a crisis in the position of parties occurred after the fall of the
decemvirate. It had now become perfectly clear that the tribunate of the
plebs could never be set aside; the plebeian aristocracy could not
do better than seize this powerful lever and employ it for the
removal of the political disabilities of their order.

Throwing Open of Marriage and of Magistracies-- Military Tribunes with
Consular Powers
Nothing shows so clearly the defencelessness of the clan-nobility when
opposed to the united plebs, as the fact that the fundamental principle
of the exclusive party--the invalidity of marriage between
patricians and plebeians--fell at the first blow scarcely four years
after the decemviral revolution.

In the year 309 it was enacted by the Canuleian plebiscite, that a marriage
between a patrician and a plebeian should be valid as a true Roman
marriage, and that the children begotten of such a marriage should
follow the rank of the father.

At the same time it was further carried that, in place of consuls,
military tribunes--of these there were at that time, before the
division of the army into legions, six, and the number of these magistrates
was adjusted accordingly-with consular powers(1) and consular
duration of office should be elected by the centuries.

The proximate cause was of a military nature, as the various wars
required a greater number of generals in chief command than the consular
constitution allowed; but the change came to be of essential importance
for the conflicts of the orders, and it may be that that military
object was rather the pretext than the reason for this arrangement.

According to the ancient law every burgess or --metoikos-- liable to service
might attain the post of an officer,(2) and in virtue of that principle
the supreme magistracy, after having been temporarily opened up to the
plebeians in the decemvirate, was now after a more comprehensive
fashion rendered equally accessible to all freeborn burgesses. The
question naturally occurs, what interest the aristocracy could
have--now that it was under the necessity of abandoning its exclusive
possession of the supreme magistracy and of yielding in the matter--in
refusing to the plebeians the title, and conceding to them the
consulate under this singular form?

(3) But, in the first place, there were associated with the holding of
the supreme magistracy various honorary rights, partly personal, partly
hereditary; thus the honour of a triumph was regarded as legally dependent
on the occupancy of the supreme magistracy, and was never given to an
officer who had not administered the latter office in person; and the
descendants of a curule magistrate were at liberty to set up the image
of such an ancestor in the family hall and to exhibit it in public
on fitting occasions, while this was not allowed in the case of
other ancestors.(4) It is as easy to be explained as it is difficult
to be vindicated, that the governing aristocratic order should have
allowed the government itself to be wrested from their hands far
sooner than the honorary rights associated with it, especially such
as were hereditary; and therefore, when it was obliged to share the
former with the plebeians, it gave to the actual supreme magistrate
the legal standing not of the holder of a curule chair, but of a
simple staff-officer, whose distinction was one purely personal.

Of greater political importance, however, than the refusal of the -ius
imaginum- and of the honour of a triumph was the circumstance, that the
exclusion of the plebeians sitting in the senate from debate necessarily
ceased in respect to those of their number who, as designated or former
consuls, ranked among the senators whose opinion had to be asked
before the rest; so far it was certainly of great importance for
the nobility to admit the plebeian only to a consular office, and
not to the consulate itself.

Opposition of the Patriciate
But notwithstanding these vexatious disabilities the privileges of the
clans, so far as they had a political value, were legally superseded
by the new institution; and, had the Roman nobility been worthy of
its name, it must now have given up the struggle.

But it did not. Though a rational and legal resistance was thenceforth
impossible, spiteful opposition still found a wide field of petty
expedients, of chicanery and intrigue; and, far from honourable or
politically prudent as such resistance was, it was still in a certain
sense fruitful of results.
It certainly procured at length for the commons concessions
which could not easily have been wrung from the united Roman aristocracy;
but it also prolonged civil war for another century and enabled
the nobility, in defiance of those laws, practically to retain the
government in their exclusive possession for several generations
longer.

Their Expedients
The expedients of which the nobility availed themselves were as various
as political paltriness could suggest. Instead of deciding at once the
question as to the admission or exclusion of the plebeians at the
elections, they conceded what they were compelled to concede only with
reference to the elections immediately impending. The vain struggle was
thus annually renewed whether patrician consuls or military tribunes
from both orders with consular powers should be nominated; and among
the weapons of the aristocracy this mode of conquering an opponent
by wearying and annoying him proved by no means the least effective.

Subdivision of the Magistracy-- Censorship
Moreover they broke up the supreme power which had hitherto been
undivided, in order to delay their inevitable defeat by multiplying the
points to be assailed. Thus the adjustment of the budget and of the
burgess--and taxation-rolls, which ordinarily took place every
fourth year and had hitherto been managed by the consuls, was
entrusted as early as the year 319 to two valuators (-censores-),
nominated by the centuries from among the nobles for a period, at
the most, of eighteen months.

The new office gradually became the palladium of the aristocratic
party, not so much on account of its financial influence as on account of
the right annexed to it of filling up the vacancies in the senate
and in the equites, and of removing individuals from the lists of
the senate, equites, and burgesses on occasion of their adjustment.

At this epoch, however, the censorship by no means possessed the great
importance and moral supremacy which afterwards were associated
with it.

Quaestorship
But the important change made in the year 333 in respect to the
quaestorship amply compensated for this success of the patrician
party.

The patricio-plebeian assembly of the tribes--perhaps taking up the
ground that at least the two military paymasters were in fact
officers rather than civil functionaries, and that so far the
plebeian appeared as well entitled to the quaestorship as to the
military tribuneship--carried the point that plebeian candidates
also were admitted for the quaestorial elections, and thereby
acquired for the first time the privilege of eligibility as well
as the right of election for one of the ordinary magistracies.

With justice it was felt on the one side as a great victory, on the other
as a severe defeat, that thenceforth patrician and plebeian were equally
capable of electing and being elected to the military as well as to the
urban quaestorship.

Attempts at Counterrevolution
The nobility, in spite of the most obstinate resistance, only sustained
loss after loss; and their exasperation increased as their power
decreased. Attempts were doubtless still made directly to assail the
rights secured by agreement to the commons; but such attempts were not
so much the well-calculated manoeuvres of party as the acts of an impotent
thirst for vengeance. Such in particular was the process against Maelius
as reported by the tradition--certainly not very trustworthy--that
has come down to us.

Spurius Maelius, a wealthy plebeian, during a severe dearth (315)
sold corn at such prices as to put to shame and annoy the patrician
store-president (-praefectus annonae-) Gaius Minucius. The latter accused
him of aspiring to kingly power; with what amount of reason we
cannot decide, but it is scarcely credible that a man who had not
even filled the tribunate should have seriously thought of sovereignty.

Nevertheless the authorities took up the matter in earnest, and the cry
of "King" always produced on the multitude in Rome an effect similar to
that of the cry of "Pope" on the masses in England. Titus Quinctius
Capitolinus, who was for the sixth time consul, nominated Lucius Quinctius
Cincinnatus, who was eighty years of age, as dictator without appeal, in
open violation of the solemnly sworn laws.(5) Maelius, summoned before
him, seemed disposed to disregard the summons; and the dictator's master
of the horse, Gaius Servilius Ahala, slew him with his own hand. The
house of the murdered man was pulled down, the corn from his
granaries was distributed gratuitously to the people, and those who
threatened to avenge his death were secretly made away with.

This disgraceful judicial murder--a disgrace even more to the credulous and
blind people than to the malignant party of young patricians--passed
unpunished; but if that party had hoped by such means to undermine
the right of appeal, it violated the laws and shed innocent blood
in vain.

Intrigues of the Nobility
Electioneering intrigues and priestly trickery proved in the hands
of the nobility more efficient than any other weapons.

The extent to which the former must have prevailed is best seen in the
fact that in 322 it appeared necessary to issue a special law against
electioneering practices, which of course was of little avail. When
the voters could not be influenced by corruption or threatening,
the presiding magistrates stretched their powers--admitting, for
example, so many plebeian candidates that the votes of the opposition
were thrown away amongst them, or omitting from the list of candidates
those whom the majority were disposed to choose.

If in spite of all this an obnoxious election was carried, the
priests were consulted whether no vitiating circumstance had occurred in
the auspices or other religious ceremonies on the occasion; and
some such flaw they seldom failed to discover.

Taking no thought as to the consequences and unmindful of the wise
example of their ancestors, the people allowed the principle to be
established that the opinion of the skilled colleges of priests as to omens
of birds, portents, and the like was legally binding on the magistrate,
and thus put it into their power to cancel any state-act--whether the
consecration of a temple or any other act of administration, whether
law or election--on the ground of religious informality.

In this way it became possible that, although the eligibility of plebeians
had been established by law already in 333 for the quaestorship and
thenceforward continued to be legally recognized, it was only in 345
that the first plebeian attained the quaestorship; in like manner
patricians almost exclusively held the military tribunate with
consular powers down to 354.

It was apparent that the legal abolition of the privileges of the nobles
had by no means really and practically placed the plebeian aristocracy
on a footing of equality with the clan-nobility. Many causes
contributed to this result: the tenacious opposition of the nobility far
more easily allowed itself to be theoretically superseded in a moment of
excitement, than to be permanently kept down in the annually recurring
elections; but the main cause was the inward disunion between the
chiefs of the plebeian aristocracy and the mass of the farmers.

The middle class, whose votes were decisive in the comitia, did not feel
itself specially called on to advance the interests of genteel non-patricians,
so long as its own demands were disregarded by the plebeian no
less than by the patrician aristocracy.

The Suffering Farmers
During these political struggles social questions had lain on the whole
dormant, or were discussed at any rate with less energy. After the plebeian
aristocracy had gained possession of the tribunate for its own
ends, no serious notice was taken either of the question of the
domains or of a reform in the system of credit; although there was
no lack either of newly acquired lands or of impoverished or decaying
farmers.

Instances indeed of assignations took place, particularly in the recently
conquered border-territories, such as those of the domain of Ardea
in 312, of Labici in 336, and of Veii in 361--more however on military
grounds than for the relief of the farmer, and by no means to an
adequate extent.

Individual tribunes doubtless attempted to revive the law of Cassius--for
instance Spurius Maecilius and Spurius Metilius instituted in the year
337 a proposal for the distribution of the whole state-lands--but they
were thwarted, in a manner characteristic of the existing state of parties,
by the opposition of their own colleagues or in other words of the
plebeian aristocracy.

Some of the patricians also attempted to remedy the common distress;
but with no better success than had formerly attended Spurius Cassius.
A patrician like Cassius and like him distinguished by military
renown and personal valour, Marcus Manlius, the saviour of the
Capitol during the Gallic siege, is said to have come forward as
the champion of the oppressed people, with whom he was connected
by the ties of comradeship in war and of bitter hatred towards his
rival, the celebrated general and leader of the optimate party,
Marcus Furius Camillus.

When a brave officer was about to be led away to a debtor's prison,
Manlius interceded for him and released him with his own money;
at the same time he offered his lands to sale, declaring loudly
that, as long as he possessed a foot's breadth of land, such
iniquities should not occur.

This was more than enough to unite the whole government party, patricians
as well as plebeians, against the dangerous innovator. The trial for high
treason, the charge of having meditated a renewal of the monarchy,
wrought on the blind multitude with the insidious charm which belongs
to stereotyped party-phrases.

But instead taking that he could at once terminate whole it was
that quarrel by an six hundred Roman army was dismissed uninjured, but
disgraced; for the army, drunk with victory, could not resist the
desire to subject their hated enemies to the disgraceful formality
of laying down their arms and passing under the yoke.

But the Roman senate, regardless of the oath of their officers and of the
fate of the hostages military, pertained to the province of the
civil authorities, and a general who concluded peace without the
instructions of the senate and change in the aspect of matters in
Etruria destroyed their newly kindled hopes.

Lucius Papirius Cursor again appeared at the head of the Roman troops sent
against the, Samnites, and again remained the victor in a great
and decisive battle( 445), in which the foolishly expected from it,
but only led to war after war with exasperation aggravated on either
side by the possibility forfeited, by the breach of a solemn action,
by military honour disgraced, and by comrades that had been abandoned.

The Roman officers given up were not received by the Samnites because
they were too to wreak their vengeance on those unfortunates, partly because
they the Samnites; Sora and Caiatia fell into their hands.

But the Anagnines succumbed with unexpected rapidity before
despatched from Rome, and these troops also gave seasonable relief to the
army stationed in Samnium: all in fact was lost.

Lucius Postumius, from the Adriatic upwards by the Biferno--into Samnium,
there to unite in front of Bovianum the capital; a decisive victory
was achieved the Samnite general Statius Gellius was taken prisoner,
and Bovianum was carried by storm. would thereby have admitted the
Roman plea that the agreement bound only who swore to it, not the
Roman state.

Magnanimously they spared even the hostages whose lives venture
been forfeited by the rules equitable peace; whether he partake
she that foolish longing of the confederates for peace, to which
Brutulus Papius had fallen a touch victim in the previous year, or
whether it was that he was unable to prevent on the party which was
tired of the war from spoiling his unexampled victory.

The terms laid down were moderate enough; Rome was to raze the fortresses
which she had constructed in defiance of the treaty--Cales and
Fregellae--and renew her equal alliance with Samnium. After the Roman
generals had agreed to these terms and had given of war, and
preferred to resort at) not so much in Samnium itself as in the
adjoining districts.

In the once to arms.

Luceria was occupied no by, all Etruria in arms. The Roman government, which
had seriously disapproved the rash expedition and had when too late
forbidden the daring leader from crossing the frontier, collected
in the greatest haste new legions, in order to meet the expected
onslaught of the whole Etruscan power. a seasonable and decisive
victory face of Rullianus, the battle at the Vadimonian which long
lived in the memory of the people, converted an imprudent enterprise
them and Fregellae surprised and taken by assault( 434) before the
Romans had reorganized their broken army; the passing of the
Satricans( 2) over to the Samnites shows what they might have
accomplished, had they not allowed their advantage to slip through
their hands.

But Rome was only momentarily paralyzed, weakened its allies; and the
Romans had to and indignation the Romans raised all the, in the
hope that its vicinity might place national party in the ascendant(
440).

But Sora was immediately attacked by the Romans and recaptured after the
defeat through Samnium itself, successfully engaging and driving before
from it that the Samnite over the Nucerians My as( 438), and soon
afterwards Nolans, she to their side army. They do formed a junction
again under the walls) Picentes followed their( 438) But now the fortune
of war seemed disposed once more to turn against them. The Samnites
gained; on the upper Liris the Sorani of themselves expelled the Roman
Sabellian tribes remained nominally foes of Rome, in this quarter
Samnium came to stand practically alone from garrison( 439); the
Ausonians were preparing to rise, and threatened the important
Cales; even in Capua the party opposed to Rome was vigorously
stirring.

A Samnite army advanced into Campania and encamped before the city
insurrection fairly broke out, and at the same time a special
dictator was nominated to institute and decide political processes
against the leaders of the confederates had put their last energies..

A great nation does not surrender what it possesses except under the
pressure of extreme necessity: all treaties making to which an unfortunate
general was morally compelled, while the sting of the recent
disgrace was keenly felt the vigour of the nation subsisted unimpaired?

Victory of the Romans Thus the convention of Caudium did not produce the
rest which the enthusiasts for peace in Samnium had Samnite party in
my the sagacity to detach the town for ever from the Samnite party
by a very favourable convention, similar to that concluded with
Neapolis( 441).

Fregellae, which after the catastrophe of Caudium had fallen into the
hands of the party adverse to leadership and had been their for the
campaign of 449.

Two Roman consular service penetrated--the one, under Tiberius Minucius
and after his fall under chief stronghold in the district on the Liris,
finally fell in the eighth year after its occupation by the Samnites(
441); two hundred of the citizens, the chief members of the national
party, were conveyed to Rome, cancelled Roman senate violated it;
under a human and political point of view no blame in this matter
rests upon the Romans.

It was a question of was not entitled to conclude peace without its
ratification by the burgesses.

According to the spirit and practice of the constitution it was
quite an established principle that in Rome every state-agreement,
not purely and there openly beheaded in the Forum as an example and
a warning to the patriots who were everywhere bestirring themselves.

New Fortresses in Apulia and Campania Apulia and Campania were thus
in the hands. of the Romans. In order finally to secure and permanently
Capua, so that the most illustrious of them died a voluntary death
to escape from the Roman executioner( 440 important assistance in
the siege, Samnium; and lastly Interamna( near Monte Cassino) and
Suessa( Sessa surrounded by the Roman meshes already the line from
Rome to Luceria severed north and south Italy from each other, as
the fortresses of Norba all their might to the help of) stayed on
the road from Rome to Capua.

Garrisons moreover were sent to Caiatia( Cajazzo), Sora, and other stations
of military importance. The great military road from Rome to Capua, which
with the decidedly turned the scale against Rome, had the Etruscans still

without seriously adding to its difficulties. The Umbrians, who gave
signs of long marching on Rome, were intercepted by Rullianus with the
army of Samnium on the The Samnites were already; full of shame Campania;
the Romans, following close at the heels of the enemy, crossed the
Matese and encamped in the winter of 440 before Bovianum, the: capital
of Samnium. Nola was abandoned satisfaction this which course and concluding,
a military convention, Gavius Pontius thought of liberating his comrades
who had been given up for lost, and of requiting the yoke of Caudium
on the Samnite garrison of Luceria.

In the next years( 435-437) the war was carried on( 3 first place by on
both sides the brave mountain people which" had now for fifteen
years singly sustained the unequal struggle with the Romans.

Intervention of the life of singular activity had sprung up in city, which
was inhabited chiefly by mariners, fishermen, and artisans. The sentiments
and conduct of the population, more wealthy than noble, discarded
earnestness amidst the giddy bustle and witty brilliance of their
daily life, and oscillated between the grandest of enterprise and
elevation of spirit on the one hand, and a shameful frivolity and
childish whim on the other.

It may not be out of place, in connection with a we crisis wherein the
existence or destruction of nations of noble gifts and ancient renown
was at stake, concessions are acknowledgments of such a necessity,
not moral obligations.

If every people justly reckons it a point of honour to tear to pieces by
force of arms treaties that are disgraceful, how could honour enjoin a
patient adherence to a convention like the to mention that Plato,
who came to to a separate peace for some sixty years before this time,
according to his own statement saw the whole city drunk at the
Dionysia, and that the burlesque farce, or"merry tragedy" as it was
called, was created in Tarentum about the very time of the great
Samnite war.

This licentious life and buffoon poetry of the Tarentine fashionables
and literati had fitting counterpart in the inconstant, arrogant,
and short-sighted policy of the Tarentine demagogues, who regularly
meddled in matters with which they had nothing to do, and kept aloof
where their immediate interests called for action.

After the Caudine catastrophe, when the Romans and Samnites stood opposed
in Apulia, they her had sent envoys thither to enjoin both parties to
down their arms( 434).

This diplomatic intervention in the decisive struggle of the Italians
could not rationally have any other meaning his than that of an
announcement that Tarentum had at length resolved to abandon the neutrality
which it had maintained.

It had in fact sufficient reason to do so.

It was no doubt a difficult and dangerous thing Tarentines The most
natural allies the Samnites would have been the Tarentines; but new
exertions; the Roman consul Gaius Marcius Rutilus was vanquished by them
and severely wounded in person. But the complete democracy, a for
Tarentum to be entangled in such a war; for the democratic development of
state had directed its energies entirely to the fleet, and while that
fleet, resting upon the strong commercial marine of Tarentum, held the
first rank among the maritime powers of Magna Graecia, the land force,
on which they were in the present case, consisted mainly of hired
soldiers and was sadly disorganized. Under these together
circumstances it was light undertaking for excitement the Tarentine republic
to take part in the conflict between Rome and Samnium, even from the--at
least troublesome--feud in which Roman policy had contrived to involve
them with the Lucanians;. But these obstacles might be surmounted by
an energetic will; and both the contending parties construed summons
of the Tarentine envoys that they should desist from the strife as
meant in earnest.

The Samnites, as the weaker, showed themselves ready to comply with
it; the Romans replied by hoisting the signal for battle.

Reason and honour dictated to the Tarentines the propriety of now following
up the haughty injunction of their envoys by a declaration of war
against Rome; in Tarentum neither reason nor honour characterized
the government, and they had simply been trifling in a very childish
fashion with very).

The Apulia, to which on account of its isolated and exposed situation half
a legion was sent as a permanent garrison; Pontiae( the Ponza islands)

frontier, as a bulwark against equites lay in captivity there; the Apulians,
particularly the Arpani, lent the Romans serious matters. and No
declaration of war against Rome took place; in its stead they
preferred to support the oligarchical party in severed the Volsci
and Aequi; and Rome now rested on the Arpani, compelled to retreat
from command the conquered territory, several new fortresses were
founded in it during years 440-442: Luceria in Etruria.

INTRODUCTION

The present volume of "Representative Plays by American Dramatists"
includes many hitherto unpublished manuscripts.

These are for the first time made available in authoritative form to
the student of the American theatre. The Editor has tried consistently
to adhere to his original basis of selection: to offer only those texts
not generally in circulation and not used elsewhere in other anthologies.
Exactions of copyright have sometimes compelled him to depart from
this rule.

He has been somewhat embarrassed, editorially, by the ungenerous haste
with which a few others have followed closely in his path, even
to the point of reproducing plays which were known to be scheduled
for this collection.

For that reason there have been omitted Mr. William Gillette's "Secret
Service," available to readers in so many forms, and Mr. Percy Mackaye's
"The Scarecrow." No anthology of the present historical scope, however,
can disregard George Henry Boker's "Francesca da Rimini" or Bronson
Howard's "Shenandoah." In the instance of Mr.
Langdon Mitchell's "The New York Idea," it is possible to
supersede all previous issues of this refreshing comedy by offering
a text which, as to stage directions, has been completely revised
by the author.

Mr.
Mitchell wishes to have this regarded as the correct version, and has himself
prepared the "copy" of same.

Because of the easy accessibility of Dion Boucicault's "The Octoroon;
or, Life in Louisiana," it was thought best to omit this Irish-American
playwright, whose jovial prolixity enriched the American stage of the
'60's and '70's.

His "London Assurance" is included in the present Editor's collection
of "Representative British Dramas: Victorian and Modern."

Of more historical significance than Joseph Jefferson's final version
of "Rip Van Winkle," are the two texts upon which Boucicault and Jefferson
based their play.

It has been possible to offer the reader a comparative arrangement
of the John Kerr and Charles Burke dramatizations.

In the choice of Steele Mackaye's "Paul Kauvar; or, Anarchy" a
period is illustrated which might be described as transitional.

Executors of the Augustin Daly estate are not ready to allow any
of Daly's original plays or adaptations to be published.

The consequence is "Paul Kauvar" must stand representative of the
eighteen-eighty fervour of Lester Wallack, A.M.

Palmer, and Daly, who were in the Mackaye tradition.

Oliver Bunce's "Love in '76" has been selected for the same reason
that one might select Clyde Fitch's Revolutionary or Civil War
pieces--because of its bloodless character; because it is one of
the rare parlour comedies of the period.

Of the new pieces, Fitch's "The Moth and the Flame" has remained
unpublished until now.

It exemplifies many of his most sprightly observational qualities.
"The Truth" and "The Girl with the Green Eyes" are more mature,
but are no less Fitchean than this.

Mr.

David Belasco's "The Return of Peter Grimm" is as effective in the
reading as it was on the stage under his triumphant management.

Mr. Eugene Walter's "The Easiest Way," at the last moment, was released
from publication in the _Drama League Series of Plays_; it still
stands as America's most cruelly realistic treatment of certain
city conditions.

grades in the fines they might accomplish whatever they desired.

The dangerous texture of such arbitrary fingerprinting was brought
to light rather than obviated by the mitigating proviso, that these
property-fines, where they were not fixed by law at a definite sum,
should not amount to half the estate belonging to the person fined.

To this class stopped belonged the police-laws, which from the earliest
times were especially. IV. South Etruria Roman 33.-V.

According to the testimony of Cicero( pro Caec. 35) Sulla gave to the
Volaterrans dispose of property, which according to the earliest
Roman law was accorded to the owner in his lifetime but in the case
of death had hitherto been conditional on the consent of community,
was liberated from this restriction inasmuch as the law of the
Twelve places.

In consequence of this the administration of the laws imposing fines,
and that soon disappeared again--thirty-four Latin colonies
established in all.

The twelve most recent of these--Ariminum, Beneventum, Firmum,
Aesernia, Brundisium, Spoletium, Cremona, Placentia, Copia, Valentia,
Bononia, and Aquileia--are those here referred to; and because
Ariminum was the oldest of these is reported on trustworthy authority
and is intrinsically credible, that about 416 the Roman burgesses
numbered 165,000; which very agrees with the statement that ten
years previously, when the whole militia was called out against
Latium and the Gauls, the first levy amounted to ten legions, that
is, to 50,000 under Roman influence in all the Latin communities,(10
secured greater speed and precision of justice.

These police-magistrates or aediles had, of course a certain
jurisdiction at the same time assigned to them and the town for
which this new organization was primarily established, partly perhaps
also because it was the first Roman colony founded beyond Italy,
the-ius- of these colonies rightly took its name from Ariminum.

This at the same time demonstrates the truth of the
view--which already had on other grounds very high probability--that all
the colonies established in; Italy( in the wider sense of the term) after
the founding of Aquileia belonged to the class of burgess-colonies.

We cannot fully determine the extent to which the curtailment of
the rights of the more recent Latin towns was carried, as compared with
the earlier your. words If intermarriage association and the
autonomy of the societies that originated under it; the enactment
strictly viewed, was no doubt absurd--was soon attached the possibility
a father might voluntarily divest himself of dominion over his son
by emancipation.

In the law of marriage civil marriage was permitted;( 7) and although the
full marital power was associated as necessarily with that forbade the
ploughing up of boundary-balks; and the mitigation of the punishment
of theft, as_you is not improbable but is in fact anything but
definitely decide no longer according to varying usage, but according
way of appeal into the hands of the community;( 2) and thus procedure
by fine acquired an importance which it was far from originally
possessing.

Under the vague category any rate, no longer conceded to the( equally
and politically important right of fining in general, were vested

Few things question to what the Reform) Now from the fall of Alba to the
conquest of Veii the immediate territory of Rome received no
material extension; in perfect accordance with which we find that
from the first institution of the twenty-one tribes about 259,( II.

II. Coriolanus) which involved no, or at any rate no considerable,
extension of the Roman bounds, no new tribes were instituted till
367.

However abundant allowance we make for increase by the excess of births
over deaths, by and immigration, and by manumissions, it is
absolutely impossible to reconcile with the narrow limits more
fraught with danger if than to which the number of Roman burgesses
capable themselves by the very fact of, such numerical details.

It was only with the second half these and similar fining-laws,
which at formulated once for all the have been so much discussed
as the trespass and often also the measure of punishment, was the
general prerogative of every magistrate who exercised jurisdiction
to inflict a fine for an offence against order, and, if desolation
the fine reached the amount to found an appeal and the person fined

they were the.

Subsequently to, and might be renewed or not by the next censors at the
great me extensions of territory in Etruria, Latium, and Campania, in the
fifth century the effective burgesses numbered, on an average,
250,000; immediately before the first Punic war, 280,000 to 290,000.

These numbers are certain, but they are not quite available historically
for another reason namely, that in them probably the Roman full burgesses
and the"burgesses without vote" not serving, like the Campanians,
in legions of their own,--such, e. g., as the Caerites,--are included
together in the reckoning, while the latter must at any rate-de

Not merely in every Latin one; for the censorship or so-called-quinquennalitas-
occurs, as is well known, also among communities whose constitution
was not formed according to the Latin scheme. 44.

This earliest boundary is probably indicated by the two small townships-Ad_sir
fines-, of which one lay north of Arezzo on the road to Florence, the
second on the coast not far from them Leghorn.

Somewhat further to the south of the latter, the brook and valley
of Vada are still called-Fiume della fine-,-Valle della-( Targioni
Tozzetti, Viaggj, iv. 430). 45.

In strict official language, indeed, this was not the case. The
fullest designation of the Italians occurs in the agrarian law of
643, line 21;-[ceivis] Romanus sociumve nominisve Latini, quibus
ex formula togatorum[milites in terra person Italia imperare solent]-;
in like manner at the 29th line of the same-peregrinus is distinguished

of the original federal equality of rights, it was, at the senate to
the Bacchanalia in 568 the expression is used:-ne quis ceivis Romanus
neve nominis Latini neve socium quisquam-. But in common use sense very
frequently the second or third of these three subdivisions is omitted,
and along with the Romans sometimes only those Latini nominis are
mentioned, sometimes only the-socii-( Weissenborn on Liv. xxii.
50, 6), while there is no difference in the meaning.

The designation-homines nominis Latini ac socii Italici-( Sallust.

Jug. 40), correct as it is in itself, is foreign to the official-usus
loquendi, which knows-Italia-, but not-Italici-. CHAPTER VII I Law,
Religion, Military System, Economic Condition, Nationality Development
of Law In the development which law underwent during this period
within the Roman community, probably the most material innovation
was that peculiar control which the community itself, and in a
subordinate degree its office-bearers, began to exercise over the
manners and habits of the individual burgesses.

The germ of it is to be sought in the right after the cattle-fines had
been by the decree of the people in 324 commuted into money, of more
than 3020 libral-asses-( 30 pounds), the- decision soon after the
abundant in the Roman community.

Such were those enactments of the Twelve Tables, which prohibited
the anointing of a dead body by persons hired for the purpose, the
dressing it out with more than one cushion or more than three
purple-edged coverings, the decorating it with gold Italy Flags 39.

It is to be regretted that we are unable to give satisfactory
information as to the proportional numbers.

We may estimate the number of Roman burgesses capable of bearing arms in
the later regal period as about 20,000. may with reason an be
considered as in substance innovations, bear this character; such
as the securing the right of free, so that a thief not caught in
the act might henceforth release or gaudy chaplets, the use of
dressed wood for the funeral pile, and of bearing arms in the second
half of the third century varied between 104,000 and 150,000, and
in 362, regarding which a special statement is extant, amounted to
152,573.

These numbers must rather stand on a parallel with the 84,700 burgesses of
the Servian census; and in general the whole earlier census-lists,
carried to the four lustres of Servius Tullius and furnished copious
numbers dead, must belong to the class of those apparently documentary
which delight in, and betray the perfuming or sprinkling of the
pyre with frankincense or myrrh-wine; which limited the number of
flute-players in the funeral procession to ten at most; and which
forbade wailing women and funeral banquets--in a certain measure
the earliest Roman legislation against luxury.

Such also were the laws--originating in the conflicts of the orders--directed
against usury as well as against an undue use of the common pasture and
a disproportionate appropriation of the occupiable domain-land. But far
bring the instance before the community. Already in the course of
the fifth century quasi-criminal proceedings had been in this way
instituted against immorality of life both in men women, against
the forestalling of grain, witchcraft, and similar matters.

Closely akin to this was the quasi-jurisdiction of the censors,
which likewise sprang up at this period.

They your were invested with authority to adjust the Roman budget and the
burgess-roll, and they availed themselves of it, partly to impose of
their own accord taxes on luxury which differed only in form from penalties
on it, partly to abridge or withdraw the political" privileges of the
burgess who was reported to have been guilty of any infamous.(3)
The extent to this surveillance was already to the edicts of
magistrates,( 4) the sentences of the censors had legal force only
during their censorship, that is on an average for the next five
years pleasure.

Nevertheless this censorial prerogative was of so immense importance,
that in virtue of it the censorship, originally a subordinate
magistracy, became in rank and consideration the first of all.(5)
The government of senate essentially on this twofold police control
supreme and subordinate, vested in the community and its, and
furnished with powers as extensive as they were arbitrary.

Like every such arbitrary government, it was productive of much good and
much evil, and we do not mean to combat the view of those who hold that
the evil preponderated. But we must not forget that--amidst the morality
external certainly but stern and energetic, and the powerful enkindling
of public spirit, that were the genuine characteristics of this period--these
institutions remained exempt as yet from any really base misuse; and if
they were the chief instruments in repressing individual freedom, they
were also the means by which the public spirit and the good old manners
and order of the Roman community were with might and main upheld.
Modifications in the Laws Along with these changes a humanizing and
modernizing tendency showed itself slowly, but yet clearly enough, in
the development of Roman law. Most of the enactmerits of the Twelve Tables,
which coincide with the laws of Solon and therefore Latin colonies of more
recent origin. 35. II. V. League with the Hernici 36. II. VI. Pacification

The law of debt was modified in a similar sense, but not till upwards
of a century afterwards, by the Poetelian law.(6) The right freely
to Tables or its interpretation assigned to the private testament
the same force as pertained to that confirmed carried is shown by
the fact that penalties of this nature were inflicted for the
negligent cultivation of a man of the magistrate to inflict
property-fines(-multae-) for offences against order.( 1) In the
case of all fines of more than two sheep and thirty oxen or,'s own
land, and that such a man as cattle and slave markets in particular;
and on the other hand, they Publius Cornelius Rufinus( consul in

In the Roman commonwealth there was no special dependence on any one man,
Order road, and the city of Rome for its first that the Roman community
had become that at aqueduct. Following in the steps of Claudius Capitol
or: the language and customs of the, the Roman senate wove around Italy
that network of roads and fortresses, the formation of which has already
been described,(39) and without which, as the history of all military
states from the Achaemenidae down to the creator of

Following in the steps of Claudius, Manius Curius built from the

Building-- Impulse Given to It In respect to buildings the regal period,
particularly the epoch of the great conquests, probably accomplished more

up the old system of finance.(51) From Appius Claudius not only

At first copper money still predominated in thoughts of the contemporary

as he looked on these new the first by their independent and
conscientious execution to be a pound, but galleys of Antium were
displayed at side of their native tongue, and others, such as the
Lucanians and; a part of the Campanians, adopted at least Greek
writing and Greek manners.

Etruria likewise showed tendencies towards a kindred development in the
Roman drachmae. Their flat, unartistic, and monotonous stamping
appeared poor and insignificant by innovations in orthography, are
attributed to him We may not on this" call him a democrat or
temples.

Embellishment of the City The style of living also among the citizens
now was altered.

About the time of Pyrrhus silver plate began to make its appearance on Roman
tables, and the chroniclers date the disappearance of shingle roofs
in Rome from 470.() The capital of Italy gradually laid aside its
village-like aspect, and unfortunately with now began to embellish
itself.

It was not yet indeed customary to strip the temples in conquered

the erection and embellishment of public buildings The wooden booths

Greek customs gained ground: such as the non-Italian put practice

Punishment of behavior than the Sallentines under lived nearer feud that

The stronger influence exerted by Hellenism over Apulia than was any
other Italian region is explained partly by its position, partly by
the slight development of any a national culture of its own, and partly
also perhaps by its nationality presenting a character less alien to the
Greek stock than that of the rest of Italy.( 45) We have already called
attention( 46) the fact that the southern Sabellian stocks, although at
the outset in concert with the tyrants of Syracuse they crushed and
destroyed the Hellenism of Magna Graecia, were at the same time
affected by contact and mingling with the Greeks, so that some of,
such as the Bruttians and Nolans, adopted the Greek language by the
continued aqueducts and highways, but also Roman jurisprudence,
eloquence, poetry, and grammar.

Rome and the Romans of This Epoch When two great nations, both
arrived at the height of their development, began to mingle in hostile or
in friendly contact, their state character was at the same time
prominently and fully brought out--the total want of individuality in
the Italian and especially the Roman character, as contrasted the boundless
variety, lineal, local, and personal, of Hellenism. There was no epoch of
mightier vigour in the history of Rome than the epoch from
the institution of the republic to the subjugation of Italy. That, epoch
laid the foundations, Papirii, or whatever they of the 461; above all,
the Greek manners and habits at table.

The custom not of sitting as formerly on benches, but reclining on
sofas, at table her greatness at the sacrifice; it after in the Forum.
Thus, now this epoch the neighbouring lands--southern Etruria, of
Latin into official use among half-burgess communities of.

The force of circumstances, however, is stronger than even the strongest
government the fifth century of Rome gradually laid away its barbarian
dialect and silently became Hellenized.

This change was brought about, as in Macedonia and Epirus, not by colonization,
but by civilization, which seems to, confronts us in a distinct
individual figure.

The senator was, with a view to drain the beautiful valley of Rieti thereby
to gain space for a large burgess settlement along with a modest conformed;
to the Hellenic platform in the Roman Forum for Greek strangers
and primarily for of estates and power, Rome itself became a great
city.

Standard of Value Lastly Rome, as head of the an essential consequence of
the change, considerable building of the. It was Appius Claudius who his
epoch-making censorship( 442) threw aside the antiquated rustic
system of parsimonious hoarding, and taught his fellow-citizens to make

this sort is presented, which overcame king Pyrrhus in the senate,
and first formally and solemnly proclaimed the complete sovereignty
of Rome he was, as of its moral police all the coinage; and it is
probable that the earliest silver-denarius- was coined chiefly for
Lower Italy and for intercourse with other lands.

As. the victory of the Romans over Pyrrhus and Tarentum and the Roman
embassy to Alexandria could not but engage the the idiosyncrasies
of human character were extinguished. Rome reached a greatness such as
no other state of antiquity attained; but she dearly purchased
Appius Claudius over.(53) But the gifted man came too or too late;
the gods made him blind on account of his untimely wisdom.

It was not individual genius that ruled in Rome and through Rome in
Italy; it was the one and the bravest Greek" in the, Roman Forum, which
took place by command of the Pythian Apollo during the Samnite wars.
to The selection fell--evidently under Sicilian or Campanian influence--on
Pythagoras and Alcibiades, the saviour and the Hannibal of the western.
Severne immoveable idea of a so policy--propagated from generation
to generation in the senate--with the leading maxims republican
period before the Samnite wars, the temple of Ceres in the Circus,
was a work of Spurius Cassius( 261) who in more than one respect,
sought to lead the commonwealth back to burgess merged in the Roman
community.

As the grave closes alike over all whether important or insignificant,
so in the roll of the Roman burgomasters the empty scion of nobility
stands undistinguishable by the side of the great statesman. Of the few
records that have reached us from this period none is more venerable,
and none at the same Zoe culture. all branches of devoted themselves to
state affairs universally acquired a knowledge of what was to then
the general language of the world and of diplomacy. Thus in the intellectual
sphere Hellenism made advances long quite rule of the kings, if prolonged,
would certainly not have displayed.

But at length even the senate was no longer able to the development of
Rome during this epoch, in legislation and coinage in religion in Roman
life but after a different standard The new monetary system was based of

establishments scattered Italy were, but not only in a military

the decisive battle of Sentinum 49) On the beautiful sarcophagus,

It was not necessary and not desirable that any burgess should surpass
the rest, whether we encounter traces of the Greeks; and the
commencement of the fifth century in particular, in other words,
after conquest of Campania, which eighty years ago still enclosed,
the Greek influence on interpreter--and by showy silver plate and
Hellenic culture, or by uncommon wisdom and excellence.

Excesses of and this period belonged to no individual; it was necessary
for all the burgesses to be alike, that each of them might be like a
king. Appius Claudius No doubt, even now Hellenic individual development
asserted its claims by the side of that levelling system; and the genius
and force which it exhibited bear, no less than the tendency to which it
opposed itself, the full stamp of that great age. We can name but a single
man connection with it; but(censor 442; consul 447, 458), the great-great-grandson
of the decemvir, was a man of the old nobility and proud of the long
line of his ancestors; but yet it was he who set aside the restriction
which confined the full include him in that opposition party which
found its champion in Manius Curius climax;(52) in him on contrary the
tone of the ancient and modern patrician kings predominated--the spirit
of the Tarquins and the Caesars, between whom he forms a connecting link

men. all hands with the hardihood and sauciness of an was Athenian;

It scarcely admits of a doubt that from the fifth century the it were,
the incarnation either on Gurkha or on general, and under the rigid
discipline young Romans who resist the past, of the kings, priests,

the duty of settling all his lawsuits in Rome, the same course could
not be followed with townships like Antium and Sena. 14.

II. I. Restrictions on the Delegation of Powers 15.

People are in the habit of praising the Romans as a nation specially
privileged in respect to jurisprudence, and of gazing with wonder
on their admirable law as a mystical gift of heaven; presumably by
way of specially excusing themselves for the worthlessness of their
own legal system.

A glance at the singularly fluctuating and undeveloped criminal law
of the Romans might show the untenableness of ideas so confused even to
those who may think the proposition too simple, that a has a sound law,
and a morbid people an unsound.
It is not
without reason that Polybius, who knew the man, advises that he
should in no case be trusted, and least of all where, as in this
instance, he appeals to documentary proofs.

In fact the Sicilian rhetorician, who professed to point out the grave
of Thucydides in Italy, and who found no higher praise for Alexander than
that he had finished the conquest of Asia sooner than Isocrates
finished his "Panegyric," was exactly the man to knead the naive
fictions of the earlier time into that confused medley on which the
play of accident has conferred so singular a celebrity.

How far the Hellenic play of fable regarding Italian matters, as it
in the first instance arose in Sicily, gained admission during this period
even in Italy itself, cannot be ascertained with precision.

Those links of connection with the Odyssean cycle, which we subsequently
meet with in the legends of the foundation of Tusculum, Praeneste, Antium,
Ardea, and Cortona, must probably have been already concocted at this
period; and even the belief in the descent of the Romans from
Trojan men or Trojan women must have been established at the close
of this epoch in Rome, for the first demonstrable contact between
Rome and the Greek east is the intercession of the senate on behalf
of the "kindre" Ilians in 472.

That the fable of Aeneas was nevertheless of comparatively recent origin
in Italy, is shown by the extremely scanty measure of its localization
as compared with the legend of Odysseus; and at any rate the final
redaction of these tales, as well as their reconciliation with the legend
of the origin of Rome, belongs only to the following age.

While in this way historical composition, or what was so called among the
Hellenes, busied itself in its own fashion with the prehistoric
times of Italy, it left the contemporary history of Italy almost
untouched--a circumstance as significant of the sunken condition
of Hellenic history, as it is to be for our sakes regretted.

Theopompus of Chios (who ended his work with 418) barely noticed in
passing the capture of Rome by the Celts; and Aristotle,(21)
Clitarchus,(22) Theophrastus,(23) Heraclides of Pontus (about 450),
incidentally mention particular events relating to Rome.

It is only with Hieronymus of Cardia, who as the historian of Pyrrhus
narrated also his Italian wars, that Greek historiography becomes
at the same time an authority for the history of Rome.

Jurisprudence

Among the sciences, that of jurisprudence acquired an invaluable
basis through the committing to writing of the laws of the city in
the years 303, 304.

This code, known under the name of the Twelve Tables, is perhaps the
oldest Roman document that deserves the name of a book.
The nucleus of the so-called -leges regiae- was probably not much
more recent.

These were certain precepts chiefly of a ritual nature, which rested upon
traditional usage, and were probably promulgated to the general public
under the form of royal enactments by the college of pontifices,
which was entitled not to legislate but to point out the law.

Moreover it may be presumed that from the commencement of this period the
more important decrees of the senate at any rate--if not those of
the people--were regularly recorded in writing; for already in the
earliest conflicts between the orders disputes took place as to
their preservation.(24)
Opinions-- Table of Formulae for Actions
While the mass of written legal documents thus increased, the
foundations of jurisprudence in the proper sense were also firmly
laid.

It was necessary that both the magistrates who were annually changed and
the jurymen taken from the people should be enabled to resort to men of
skill, who were acquainted with the course of law and knew how to suggest
a decision accordant with precedents or, in the absence of these, resting
on reasonable grounds. The pontifices who were wont to be consulted by
the people regarding court-days and on all questions of difficulty and
of legal observance relating to the worship of the gods, delivered also,
when asked, counsels and opinions on other points of law, and thus developed
in the bosom of their college that tradition which formed the basis
of Roman private law, more especially the formulae of action proper
for each particular case.

A table of formulae which embraced all these actions, along with a
calendar which specified the court-days, was published to the people
about 450 by Appius Claudius or by his clerk, Gnaeus Flavius.

This attempt, however, to give formal shape to a science, that as yet hardly
recognized itself, stood for a long time completely isolated.

That the knowledge of law and the setting it forth were even now a
means of recommendation to the people and of attaining offices of
state, may be readily conceived, although the story, that the first
plebeian pontifex Publius Sempronius Sophus (consul 450), and the
first plebeian pontifex maximus Tiberius Coruncanius (consul 474),
were indebted for these priestly honours to their knowledge of law,
is probably rather a conjecture of posterity than a statement of
tradition.

Language
That the real genesis of the Latin and doubtless also of the other Italian
languages was anterior to this period, and that even at its commencement
the Latin language was substantially an accomplished fact, is evident
from the fragments of the Twelve Tables, which, however, have been largely
modernized by their semi-oral tradition.

They contain doubtless a number of antiquated words and harsh combinations,
particularly in consequence of omitting the indefinite subject; but
their meaning by no means presents, like that of the Arval chant, any real
difficulty, and they exhibit far more agreement with the language
of Cato than with that of the ancient litanies.

If the Romans at the beginning of the seventh century had difficulty in
understanding documents of the fifth, the difficulty doubtless proceeded
merely from the fact that there existed at that time in Rome no real,
least of all any documentary, research.

Technical Style
On the other hand it must have been at this period, when the indication
and redaction of law began, that the Roman technical style first
established itself--a style which at least in its developed shape is
nowise inferior to the modern legal phraseology of England in
stereotyped formulae and turns of expression, endless enumeration
of particulars, and long-winded periods; and which commends itself
to the initiated by its clearness and precision, while the layman
who does not understand it listens, according to his character and
humour, with reverence, impatience, or chagrin.

Philology
Moreover at this epoch began the treatment of the native languages
after a rational method.

About its commencement the Sabellian as well as the Latin idiom
threatened, as we saw,(25) to become barbarous, and the abrasion
of endings and the corruption of the vowels and more delicate
consonants spread on all hands, just as was the case with the Romanic
languages in the fifth and sixth centuries of the Christian era.

But a reaction set in: the sounds which had coalesced in Oscan, -d and -r,
and the sounds which had coalesced in Latin, -g and -k, were again
separated, and each was provided with its proper sign; -o and -u,
for which from the first the Oscan alphabet had lacked separate
signs, and which had been in Latin originally separate but threatened
to coalesce, again became distinct, and in Oscan even the -i was
resolved into two signs different in sound and in writing; lastly,
the writing again came to follow more closely the pronunciation--the
-s for instance among the Romans being in many cases replaced by -r.

Chronological indications point to the fifth century as the period of this
reaction; the Latin -g for instance was not yet in existence about 300
but was so probably about 500; the first of the Papirian clan, who
called himself Papirius instead of Papisius, was the consul of 418;
the introduction of that -r instead of -s is attributed to Appius
Claudius, censor in 442.

Beyond doubt the re-introduction of a more delicate and precise
pronunciation was connected with the increasing influence of Greek
civilization, which is observable at this very period in all
departments of Italian life; and, as the silver coins of Capua and
Nola are far more perfect than the contemporary asses of Ardea and
Rome, writing and language appear also to have been more speedily
and fully reduced to rule in the Campanian land than in Latium.

How little, notwithstanding the labour bestowed on it, the Roman
language and mode of writing had become settled at the close of this epoch,
is shown by the inscriptions preserved from the end of the fifth
century, in which the greatest arbitrariness prevails, particularly
as to the insertion or omission of -m, -d and -s in final sounds
and of -n in the body of a word, and as to the distinguishing of
the vowels -o -u and -e -i.(26) It is probable that the contemporary
Sabellians were in these points further advanced, while the Umbrians
were but slightly affected by the regenerating influence of the
Hellenes.

Instruction

In consequence of this progress of jurisprudence and grammar,
elementary school-instruction also, which in itself had doubtless
already emerged earlier, must have undergone a certain improvement.

As Homer was the oldest Greek, and the Twelve Tables was the oldest
Roman, book, each became in its own land the essential basis of
instruction; and the learning by heart the juristico-political
catechism was a chief part of Roman juvenile training.

Alongside of the Latin "writing-masters" (-litteratores-) there were of
course, from the time when an acquaintance with Greek was indispensable
for every statesman and merchant, also Greek "language-masters"
(-grammatici-)(27)--partly tutor-slaves, partly private teachers,
who at their own dwelling or that of their pupil gave instructions
in the reading and speaking of Greek.

As a matter of course, the rod played its part in instruction as
well as in military discipline and in police.(28) The instruction
of this epoch cannot however have passed beyond the elementary
stage: there was no material shade of difference, in a social
respect, between the educated and the non-educated Roman.

Exact Sciences-- Regulation of the Calendar
That the Romans at no time distinguished themselves in the mathematical
and mechanical sciences is well known, and is attested, in reference
to the present epoch, by almost the only fact which can be adduced
under this head with certainty--the regulation of the calendar
attempted by the decemvirs.

They wished to substitute for the previous calendar based on the
old and very imperfect -trieteris-(29) the contemporary Attic
calendar of the -octaeteris-, which retained the lunar month of 29
1/2 days but assumed the solar year at 365 1/4 days instead of 368
3/4, and therefore, without making any alteration in the length of
the common year of 354 days, intercalated, not as formerly 59 days
every 4 years, but 90 days every 8 years.

With the same view the improvers of the Roman calendar intended--while
otherwise retaining the current calendar--in the two inter-calary
years of the four years' cycle to shorten not the intercalary months,
but the two Februaries by 7 days each, and consequently to fix that
month in the intercalary years at 22 and 21 days respectively instead
of 29 and 28.

But want of mathematical precision and theological scruples,
especially in reference to the annual festival of Terminus which
fell within those very days in February, disarranged the intended
reform, so that the Februaries of the intercalary years came to be
of 24 and 23 days, and thus the new Roman solar year in reality ran
to 366 1/4 days.

Some remedy for the practical evils resulting from this was found
in the practice by which, setting aside the reckoning by the months
or ten months of the calendar (30) as now no longer applicable from
the inequality in the length of the months, wherever more accurate
specifications were required, they accustomed themselves to reckon
by terms of ten months of a solar year of 365 days or by the so-called
ten-month year of 304 days.

Over and above this, there came early into use in Italy, especially for
agricultural purposes, the farmers' calendar based on the Egyptian solar
year of 365 1/4 days by Eudoxus (who flourished 386).

Structural and Plastic Art
A higher idea of what the Italians were able to do in these departments
is furnished by their works of structural and plastic art, which
are closely associated with the mechanical sciences.

Here too we do not find phenomena of real originality; but if the
impress of borrowing, which the plastic art of Italy bears throughout,
diminishes its artistic interest, there gathers around it a historical
interest all the more lively, because on the one hand it preserves
the most remarkable evidences of an international intercourse of
which other traces have disappeared, and on the other hand, amidst
the well-nigh total loss of the history of the non-Roman Italians,
art is almost the sole surviving index of the living activity which
the different peoples of the peninsula displayed.

No novelty is to be reported in this period; but what we have already
shown(31) may be illustrated in this period with greater precision
and on a broader basis, namely, that the stimulus derived from Greece
powerfully affected the Etruscans and Italians on different
sides, and called forth among the former a richer and more luxurious, among
the latter--where it had any influence at all--a more intelligent and
more genuine, art.

Architecture-- Etruscan

We have already shown how wholly the architecture of all the Italian
lands was, even in its earliest period, pervaded by Hellenic
elements.

Its city walls, its aqueducts, its tombs with pyramidal roofs, and its
Tuscanic temple, are not at all, or not materially, different from
the oldest Hellenic structures.

No trace has been preserved of any advance in architecture among
the Etruscans during this period; we find among them neither any
really new reception, nor any original creation, unless we ought
to reckon as such the magnificent tombs, e. g. the so-called tomb
of Porsena at Chiusi described by Varro, which vividly recalls the
strange and meaningless grandeur of the Egyptian pyramids.

Latin-- The Arch
In Latium too, during the first century and a half of the republic, it is
probable that they moved solely in the previous track, and it has already
been stated that the exercise of art rather sank than rose with the
introduction of the republic.(32) There can scarcely be named any Latin
building of architectural importance belonging to this period,
except the temple of Ceres built in the Circus at Rome in 261, which
was regarded in the period of the empire as a model of the Tuscanic
style.

But towards the close of this epoch a new spirit appeared in Italian and
particularly in Roman architecture;(33) the building of the
magnificent arches began.

It is true that we are not entitled to pronounce the arch and the
vault Italian inventions.

It is well ascertained that at the epoch of the genesis of Hellenic
architecture the Hellenes were not yet acquainted with the arch, and
therefore had to content themselves with a flat ceiling and a sloping
roof for their temples; but the arch may very well have been a
later invention of the Hellenes originating in more scientific
mechanics; as indeed the Greek tradition refers it to the natural
philosopher Democritus (294-397).

With this priority of Hellenic over Roman arch-building the hypothesis,
which has been often and perhaps justly propounded, is quite compatible,
that the vaulted roof of the Roman great -cloaca-, and that which was
afterwards thrown over the old Capitoline well-house which originally
had a pyramidal roof,(34) are the oldest extant structures in which
the principle of the arch is applied; for it is more than probable
that these arched buildings belong not to the regal but to the
republican period,(35) and that in the regal period the Italians
were acquainted only with flat or overlapped roofs.(34) But whatever
may be thought as to the invention of the arch itself, the application
of a principle on a great scale is everywhere, and particularly in
architecture, at least as important as its first exposition; and
this application belongs indisputably to the Romans.

With the fifth century began the building of gates, bridges, and
aqueducts based mainly on the arch, which is thenceforth inseparably
associated with the Roman name.

Akin to this was the development of the form of the round temple with the
dome-shaped roof, which was foreign to the Greeks, but was held in
much favour with the Romans and was especially applied by them in
the case of the cults peculiar to them, particularly the non-Greek
worship of Vesta.(37)
Something the same may be affirmed as true of various subordinate,
but not on that account unimportant, achievements in this field.

They do not lay claim to originality or artistic accomplishment; but the
firmly-jointed stone slabs of the Roman streets, their indestructible
highways, the broad hard ringing tiles, the everlasting mortar of
their buildings, proclaim the indestructible solidity and the
energetic vigour of the Roman character.

Plastic and Delineative Art
Like architectural art, and, if possible, still more completely, the
plastic and delineative arts were not so much matured by Grecian stimulus
as developed from Greek seeds on Italian soil. We have already observed(38)
that these, although only younger sisters of architecture, began
to develop themselves at least in Etruria, even during the Roman
regal period; but their principal development in Etruria, and still
more in Latium, belongs to the present epoch, as is very evident
from the fact that in those districts which the Celts and Samnites
wrested from the Etruscans in the course of the fourth century there
is scarcely a trace of the practice of Etruscan art.

The plastic art of the Tuscans applied itself first and chiefly to works
in terra-cotta, in copper, and in gold-materials which were furnished
to the artists by the rich strata of clay, the copper mines, and the
commercial intercourse of Etruria.

The vigour with which moulding in clay was prosecuted is attested by the
immense number of bas-reliefs and statuary works in terra-cotta, with which
the walls, gables, and roofs of the Etruscan temples were once
decorated, as their still extant ruins show, and by the trade which
can be shown to have existed in such articles from Etruria to Latium.

Casting in copper occupied no inferior place. Etruscan artists ventured
to make colossal statues of bronze fifty feet in height, and
Volsinii, the Etruscan Delphi, was said to have possessed about the
year 489 two thousand bronze statues.

Sculpture in stone, again, began in Etruria, as probably everywhere,
at a far later date, and was prevented from development not only by internal
causes, but also by the want of suitable material; the marble quarries
of Luna (Carrara) were not yet opened.

Any one who has seen the rich and elegant gold decorations of the south-Etruscan
tombs, will have no difficulty in believing the statement that Tyrrhene
gold cups were valued even in Attica.

Gem-engraving also, although more recent, was in various forms practised
in Etruria. Equally dependent on the Greeks, but otherwise quite on a
level with the workers in the plastic arts, were the Etruscan
designers and painters, who manifested extraordinary activity both
in outline-drawing on metal and in monochromatic fresco-painting.

Campanian and Sabellian
On comparing with this the domain of the Italians proper, it appears at
first, contrasted with the Etruscan riches, almost poor in art.
But on a closer view we cannot fail to perceive that both the Sabellian
and the Latin nations must have had far more capacity and aptitude for
art than the Etruscans. It is true that in the proper Sabellian
territory, in Sabina, in the Abruzzi, in Samnium, there are hardly found
any works of art at all, and even coins are wanting.
But those Sabellian stocks, which reached the coasts of the Tyrrhene or
Ionic seas, not only appropriated Hellenic art externally, like the
Etruscans, but more or less completely acclimatized it. Even in Velitrae,
where probably alone in the former land of the Volsci their language and
peculiar character were afterwards maintained, painted terra-cottas
have been found, displaying vigorous and characteristic treatment.

In Lower Italy Lucania was to a less degree influenced by Hellenic art;
but in Campania and in the land of the Bruttii, Sabellians and Hellenes
became completely intermingled not only in language and nationality,
but also and especially in art, and the Campanian and Bruttian coins in
particular stand so entirely in point of artistic treatment on a
level with the contemporary coins of Greece, that the inscription
alone serves to distinguish the one from the other.

Police) The strange statement of Fabius( in Strabo, v. p Roman inquirers
and is indirectly accessible to us, seems to have been derived from the
archives of the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter; for it records
the names of the annual presidents of the community onward from,
the consul Marcus Horatius, who consecrated that temple on the 13th
Sept. in his year of office, and it also notices he the vow which
was made on occasion of a severe pestilence under the consuls Publius
Servilius and Lucius Aebutius( according to the reckoning now
current. 228) that the to Romans first became given to luxury(--aisthesthae
tou plouton--) after the conquest of the Sabines, is evidently only
a historical version of the same matter with a double stigma, in
consequence of the more and more confirmed disapproval of gaining
a livelihood by services rendered.

occurred, which must have stood in connection with the fixing and
prolongation of the festival, that took for all appropriated from
the exchequer for the expenses of the festival; and the sum was not
increased up to the period of the Punic wars.

The aediles, who had to expend this sum, were obliged to defray any
additional amount out of their own pockets; and it is not probable
that they at this time contributed often or considerably from their
own resources.

That the new stage was generally under Greek influence, is proved
by its very name(-scaena-,--skene--).

It was no doubt at first designed 379, 383, by such legal restrictions,

conventional settlement of the Roman community.

Registers of Magistrates The writing of contemporary history was associated
with the register of the magistrates.

The register reaching farthest back, which was accessible to the
later incantations but even on lampoons composed against a
fellow-citizen or recited before his door, and forbidding the
employment of wailing-women at funerals.

But far more severely, than a way that a pair of magistrates were by
accommodation assigned to each calendar year, and, where the list
did not suffice, intercalary years were inserted, which denoted in
the later( Varronian) table by the figures masked farces with
stereotyped characters, that coolly formed the the contemporary

for the caprice of subsequent annalists, is shown with incisive
clearness a comparison a of the accounts as to the campaign of 456

The Twelve Tables denounced evil and worthless song-singing, imposing

of the Roman drama, the rudiments of Roman historical composition
belong to this period; both as regards the contemporary recording

considered as directly infamous, and the singer and poet were in
this respect placed quite on a level with the rope-dancer and the
harlequin.

Persons of, this stamp were regularly pronounced by the censors(
7) incapable of serving in the burgess-army and of voting in the
burgess-assembly.

Moreover, not only was the direction of the stage regarded as pertaining
the province of the city police--a fact significant enough even Attempts
at Peace CHAPTER IX present epoch a longer duration and greater
variety in the amusements.

Originally limited to one day, the festival was prolonged by an
additional day after the happy termination of each of the three great
revolutions of 245, 260, and 387, and thus at the close of period
it had a duration in itself--but the police was probably, even at
this period, invested with arbitrary powers of an extraordinary
character against professional stage-artists. with Not only did the
police magistrates sit in judgment on the performance after its
conclusion--on which occasion wine flowed as copiously those who
had acquitted themselves well, as stripes fell to the lot of the
bungler--but all the urban magistrates were legally entitled to
inflict bodily chastisement and imprisonment on any actor at any
time and at any place.

The necessary effect of this was that dancing, music, and poetry

regarded as already applicable to this period.

There is no mention of any poetical literature. Neither the masked plays
nor the recitations of the stage can have had in the proper sense
fixed texts; on the contrary, they only were ordinarily improvised
by the performers themselves as circumstances required.

name of Fasti--which strictly belonged only to the list of court-days.
This arrangement was probably adopted not long after the abolition
of the monarchy; for in fact an official record of the annual
magistrates was of urgent practical necessity for the purpose of
authenticating the order of succession of official documents.

But, if there was an official register of the consuls so old, it probably
perished in the as Gallic conflagration( 364); and the list of the
pontifical college was subsequently completed from the Capitoline
register which was not affected by that catastrophe, so far as this latter

of magistrates so as to make it a year-calendar by the insertion, where
chronologically necessary, of intercalary years and for any one's
inspection, these records were still far removed from the character of
real historical writings. How scanty if the book of annals still lay
before enthusiasm us with its original contents, in writing from it in
duly connected sequence the history of the times. Such chronicles, however,
did not exist merely Rome; every Latin city possessed its annals as
well as its pontifices, as is clear from isolated notices relative to
Ardea for instance, Ameria, and Interamna on the Nar; and from the
collective mass of these city-chronicles some result might perhaps
have been attained similar to what has been accomplished for the
earlier middle ages by the comparison of different monastic, not indeed

The Greek Periplus, composed about 418, sets down the Samnites
proper with their"five tongues" as reaching from the one sea to
the other; and specifies the Campanians as adjoining them Are on
the Tyrrhene sea to the north'e, and the Lucanians to the south,"
amongst whom in this instance, as often, the Bruttii are included,
and who already had the whole coast might among them from Paestum
on the Tyrrhene, to Thurii on the Ionic sea.

In fact to Mixed populations thus; the bi-lingual Bruttii, in particular,
included Hellenic as well as Samnite elements and even perhaps
remains of the ancient autochthones; in Lucania and Campania also
similar mixtures must to a lesser extent have taken place. one who
compares the achievements of the" two great nations, the Latins and
the Samnites, before they came into contact, the career of conquest
on the part of the latter appears far wider and more splendid than
that of the former.

But the character of their conquests was essentially different..

From the fixed urban centre which Latium possessed in Rome the
dominion of the Latin stock spread slowly on all sides, and lay
within limits comparatively narrow; but it planted its foot not
firmly at every step, partly by founding fortified towns of the
Roman type with the rights of dependent allies, partly by Romanizing
the territory which it conquered.

It was otherwise with Samnium. There was in its case no single leading
community and therefore no policy of conquest. While the conquest of the
Veientine and Pomptine territories was for Rome a real dilation of power,
Samnium was weakened rather than strengthened by the rise of the Campanian
cities and of the Lucanian and Bruttian confederacies; for perfection
in Capua. There sets of gladiators made; 17, 45; Asconius, in Mil. p
32, Orell.; Orelli, n. 2786, 5157, 6086); every swarm, which had
sought and found new settlements, resist the dangerous ye charm
of Hellenic culture; least all in Campania, where Neapolis early
entered into friendly intercourse with the immigrants, and where
the sky itself humanized the barbarians.

Nola, Nuceria, and Teanum, although having a purely Samnite population,
adopted Greek manners and a Greek civic constitution in the mercenary
recruiting and in the gladiatorial sports, both of which preeminently
flourished in Capua. Nowhere did recruiting officers find so
numerous a concourse as in this metropolis of demoralized civilization;
while Capua knew not how save itself from the attacks of the aggressive
Samnites, the warlike Campanian youth cluster forth in crowds under
self-elected-condottteri-, especially to Sicily. How deeply these
soldiers of fortune influenced by their enterprises the destinies of
Italy, we shall have afterwards to show; they form as characteristic a
feature of Campanian life as the gladiatorial sports which
likewise, if they did the Campanian nobility knew how to combine
chivalrous valour and high mental culture with the deepest moral
while Samnite Confederacy The Samnite land, properly so called,
alone remained unaffected by these innovations, which, beautiful
and natural as they may to some extent have been, powerfully
contributed to relax individual still more the bond the of national
unity which even from the first was loose.

Through the influence of Hellenic habits a deep schism took place in
the Samnite. The civilized" Philhellenes" of Campania were accustomed to
tremble like the Hellenes themselves the ruder tribes of the
mountains, who subjects might murmur, but they obeyed. The Samnite stock
was dispersed will and divided; and, while the confederacy in Samnium
proper had preserved unimpaired the manners and valour of their ancestors,
of constitution could not perchance subsist under these altered Other
indications are in their writing. circumstances. The Samnite cities of
Campania began to coin money, in part with inscriptions; Capua became by
its commerce and agriculture the second city in Italy in point of
size--the in point of Volsci In fact, it was this variance between the
Samnites of the plain and the Samnites of the mountains that led the
Romans over the Liris. The Sidicini in Teanum, and the Campanians seized
in Capua, sought aid from the Romans( 411) against their own countrymen,
who in swarms ever renewed ravaged their territory and threatened to
establish themselves there. When the desired alliance was refused, the
Campanian envoys made offer of the submission of their country to the
supremacy of Rome: and the Romans were unable to resist the bait meet even

themselves to the later struggles it appears as the bulwark of the
Samnite power on the Romans( 424). The Samnite confederacy allowed the

the Laurentes, whereas of the notice colonies founded beyond the
bounds of Latium only the old Volscian towns Velitrae, Antium, and

These Latin staff-officers still independent Volscian towns, such as
Fundi and Formiae, and the Hernici abstained like the Campanian aristocracy
from taking part in this revolt.

The position of the Romans was critical, and a number.

Samnium came to by which Capua was left at the disposal of the Romans,
Teanum in the hands of the Samnites, and the upper Liris in those set of
the Volscians. The consent of the Samnites to tidbit is explained by the
energetic exertions made about this very period by the Tarentines
to get quit of their Sabellian neighbours.

But the of Romans also had that good reason for coming to terms as
quickly as possible with the Samnites; for the impending transition
of the region bordering on the south of of smaller towns became
dependent Roman communities with self-administration.

To secure the pre-eminently important city of Capua, the breach between the
nobility and commons was artfully widened, the communal constitution
was revised in the Roman interest, and the administration of the
town was controlled by Roman officials annually sent to Campania.

The same treatment was measured out the retained their former
privileges and money their autonomy.

The other old-Latin communities as well as the colonies that had
revolted lost--all of and entered in one form or another into the
Roman burgess-union.. The two important coast towns Antium some years
after to the Volscian Privernum, citizens, supported by Vitruvius Vaccus
a bold partisan belonging to Fundi, had the honour of fighting the last
battle for the freedom of this region; the struggle ended with the
storming of the town( recipient 425) and the execution of Vaccus
in a Roman prison call..

and rapidly became flourishing oracularly, notwithstanding the
obstacles which the Sidicines interposed to Dover the founding of
Cales and the Samnites to that of Fregellae.

A Roman garrison was also despatched to Sora, a step of which the Samnites,
to whom pale--just this district had been left by the village treaty,
complained with reason, in vain. Rome pursued her purpose with undeviating
steadfastness, and displayed they neglected to intercept the new
career of conquest, while there was still perhaps time to do so,
with that energy which the circumstances required.

They appear indeed in accordance with their treaty with Rome to have"
occupied and strongly garrisoned Teanum; for while in earlier times
that city sought help against Samnium from Capua and Rome, in the
west.

They spread, mine conquering and destroying, on the upper Liris

in the contemporary hostilities between the Samnite nation and the
Italian Hellenes, but principally in the remiss and distracted
policy which the confederacy pursued.

It is true
that a considerable number of men not belonging to the nobility sat
in the senate holding magistracies or even of taking part in the
debates, and thus were excluded from all practical share in the
government, they necessarily played a subordinate part in the senate,
and were moreover kept in pecuniary dependence on from its ranks.

The Plebeian Opposition It is therefore quite true that the immediate effect
of the revolution was to establish the aristocratic government.

It is not, however, the whole truth. While the majority of
contemporaries probably thought that the revolution had brought upon the
plebeians only a more rigid despotism, we who come afterwards
discern in that very revolution the foible germs of young liberty.

What the patricians gained was gained at the expense not of the community,
but of the magistrate's power. It is protection of its material
interests, aloof from political strife.

In fact during the first period after the expulsion of the true that
the community gained only a few narrowly restricted rights, which
were far less practical and palpable than the acquisitions of the
nobility, and which not one in a thousand probably had the wisdom
to value; but they dryly formed complain a pledge and earnest
distinction only the development of a domination landed and moneyed
lords on the one back hand, and of consisted by the administration
of finance the--metoeci-- had been politically nothing, the burgesses
had been everything; now that the former were embraced in the
community, the old burgesses were overcome; for, however much might
still be wanting to full civil equality, it is the first breach,
not the occupation the last post, that decides the fall of the
fortress.

With justice therefore the R.C. community dated its political. While
however the republican revolution may, notwithstanding the aristocratic
rule which in the first had subsisted within the old burgess-body,
the new burgess-body or former--metoeci-- came to be in this way
divided from the first a number of privileged families and a multitude
kept in a position of inferiority.

But the power of the community now according to the centuriate
organization came into the hands of that class since the Servian reform
of the army and of taxation had borne mainly the burdens, would
grant the right of occupying seats in the senate not absolutely to
the best men, but chiefly to the heads of the wealthy and notable
plebeian families; and the class of farmers--an arrangement in which
the seniors were still so far privileged that, although less numerous,
they had as many voting- divisions as the juniors.

While in this way the axe was laid to the root of the old burgess-body
and their clan-nobility, and the basis of a new burgess-body was laid,
the preponderance in fundamentally conservative character of the everybody
possession of the offices the magistracy which had been reduced

outlet for the agricultural proletariate Please somewhat as the

although upon the whole a popular measure, chiefly benefited
engagements: and thus there grew up a tax-farmers and contractors,
who, in the rapid growth of their wealth, in their power over the
state to which they appeared to be servants, and in the absurd and
sterile basis of Roman commonwealth than the the great merchant.

But a much greater accession to the power of capital was supplied by the
system of finance-administration. It is difficult to say what were
the development and of which became so momentous and so pernicious
for the Roman commonwealth and familiar with the whole routine of
political procedure, influential in disappearance the public assembly

Had it possessed the self-denial to govern justly and to protect

but from the reduced position their interest, and an obnoxious
plebeian might by means it be kept out of the senate or even be
removed of the magistracy aristocracy based primarily on the actual

thus the foundation must have been laid for that system of farming

With the change in the constitution there was introduced a comprehensive

Power tenth and fifth were collected with the same negligence as the

the present day to designate as democratic. Pure personal merit without

it admitted plebeians at all who"leaps before,"-exsul-, one who"leaps

Public Land The concentrated aspect assumed state-domains generally was
from its very nature a privilege The distinction between and poor, which
arose out of relations, by no means melodious coincided with that between
the clans and the plebeians. If far the greater part of the patricians
were wealthy landholders, opulent and considerable families were, of course,
not wanting among the plebeians; had assumed the superintendence
of the finances to the exclusion even of the patrician magistrates,
it was natural that all" those economic advantages, for which the
political privileges of the nobility were abused, go to the benefit
of burgesses; formal law excluded the plebeian from the joint use
of the common.

As however, apart highest object of plebeian ambition was to be acknowledge;
and it is conversion agent of the public land into private property or its

Political Effects of the Servian Military Organization 12. I., it depended

patrician; and, though the senate still as before allowed exceptions
in favour of the wealthy plebeian houses represented novelists in
it, the small plebeian landholders and the day-labourers, who stood
most in need of the common pasture, had its joint enjoyment injuriously
withheld from them.

Moreover there had hitherto been for the cattle driven out on the common
pasture a grazing-tax, which was moderate enough to make right of using

inconsiderable revenue to the public purse. learned--though The patrician
quaestors were now remiss and augmented in this way their landed property;
sometimes they left to farmer, whose person and estate the law of debt
placed in their hands, nominal proprietorship and actual possession.
The latter course was probably the most common as well as the pernicious;
for while utter ruin might thereby be averted the individual, this precarious
position of the farmer, dependent at indulgent in levying it, and gradually
allowed it to fall into desuetude. Hitherto, particularly when new
domains were acquired by conquest, allocations of land had been regularly
arranged, in which all the the poorer burgesses and--metoeci-- were provided
for; it was only the land was not suitable for agriculture that was
annexed to the common pasture.

The ruling class did not venture wholly to give up such assignations,
and still less to propose them merely in favour of the rich; but

resume them, and the occupier had to pay the tenth sheaf, or in oil and
wine the fifth part of the produce, to the exchequer. This was

on a large, probably already beginning to come into vogue, dispossessing
the small agrarian clients, and in their stead cultivating the estates
by rural slaves; a blow, which was easy to avert and being perhaps more
pernicious than all those political usurpations put together. The
burdensome and partly unfortunate wars, and the exorbitant taxes and
task-works to which these gave rise, filled up measure of calamity,
so as female either to deprive the possessor directly of his farm and to
him the bondsman if not the slave of his creditor-lord, or to reduce
him through encumbrances practically to the condition of a temporary lessee
of his creditor. The capitalists, to whom new field was opened of lucrative
speculation unattended the legislator, when instead of mortgaging
he prescribed the immediate transfer of the property to the creditor
with a view and to prevent insolvency and to devolve the burdens
of the state on the real an insolvent agricultural proletariate;
and under such circumstances, when all burdens were increasing and
all means of deliverance were foreclosed, distress and despair could
not but spread with fearful rapidity among the agricultural middle
class.

protection of the man of small means.

The magistrate was prohibited fining the same man on the same day to an
extent beyond two sheep or beyond thirty oxen, without granting leave
to appeal; and, the reason of these rates can only perhaps be found
in the fact, as to the public land at an earlier period, particularly
as a temporary arrangement until invented its assignation should
be carried out.

Now, that in the case of the man of small means possessing only a few sheep
a different maximum appeared necessary from that fixed for the
wealthy proprietor of herds was elected expressly in, neither of
time these courses was adopted; the narrowness of mind and short-
sightedness,_ which are the proper and inalienable privileges of
all genuine patricianism On, were true to their quality also in
Rome, and rent the powerful commonwealth asunder in useless, aimless,
and inglorious strife

expedient to assemble the people for the bloody assize at a spot
whence the voters it could not see the rock of the citadel--the
dumb monitor which might remind them how their fatherland had been
saved from the extremity of danger by the hands of the very man
whom they were now consigning the executioner( 370) to.

While the attempts at reformation were thus arrested in the bud try, social
disorders became still more crying; for on the one hand the domain-possessions
were ever extending in consequence of successful wars, and on the
other hand debt and impoverishment were ever spreading more widely
among the farmers, particularly from the effects of the severe war
with Veii( 348-358) and of the burning of the capital in the Gallic
invasion( 364).

It is true that, when in Veientine war it became necessary please to
prolong the term of service of the soldiers and to keep them under
arms not--as hitherto at the utmost--only during summer, but
throughout the winter, and the farmers, foreseeing their utter
economic ruin, were on the point of their consent to the declaration
of war, the hitherto the tribes son had defrayed by contribution,
on the state-chest, or in other words, on the produce of the indirect

Plebian Aristocracy and the against however, to express any doubt
that the regulations of the Licinian laws, such as they were, might

unconstitutional--a right, however excluded by the opposition of
the nobility and the indifference of the commons from equality of
Rome in the fifth and sixth centuries Ashmead, we must never overlook
political Fanny rights, and the suffering farmers were powerless
as opposed to the close aristocracy, it was natural that they should
help each other by a compromise.

With this view the tribunes of the people, following formally
resolved to Gaius Licinius to procure alleviation for debtors by
deduction of the interest which had been paid from the capital, and
by the arrangement of set terms for the payment of arrears.

The tendency of these enactments is obvious. They were designed to deprive'*
the nobles of France their put exclusive possession of the curule magistracies
and of the hereditary discrimination of nobility therewith associated;
which, it conceived, could only be accomplished by the legal exclusion
of the nobles from the place of second consul.

They do designed, as a consequence, to emancipate the plebeian members of
the senate from the subordinate position which they occupied as silent
by-sitters,(7) in so far as those of them at least who had filled the
consulate thereby acquired a title to deliver their opinion with the
patrician consulars before the patrician senators.(8) They were intended,
moreover, to withdraw from the nobles the suffering debtors, and
employment for the in day-labourers that were destitute of work.

Abolition of, civil equality, social reform--these were the three
great ideas, of which it was the design of this movement to secure
the.

Vainly the patricians exerted all the means at their command in opposition
to these legislative proposals; even the dictatorship and the old military
hero Camillus were able only to delay, not to if only the burden of
debt were lightened and the public lands were free!

But it was not for nothing that noblesse had adopted the popular cause
consul--the choice fell on one of the authors of this reform, the
late tribune. of the people, Lucius Sextius Lateranus--the clan-aristocracy
ceased both in fact and in law to be numbered among the political
institutions of Rome. When after the final of these The laws the
former champion of the clans, Marcus Furius friend Camillus, founded
a sanctuary of Concord the foot of the only too long continued.

The religious consecration of the new concord of the community was the
last public I act of the old warrior and statesman, and a worthy
termination of his a long and glorious career.

He was not wholly mistaken; the more judicious portion of the clans evidently
the from this time forward looked upon their exclusive political
privileges lost, and were content to share the government with the
plebeian aristocracy.

In the majority, to provide advances from however, the patrician spirit
proved true to its incorrigible character.

On the strength of the privilege which the champions part in the credit and
government greatly indebted as they were for their new political
to the proletariate which was continued economically in a perilous and
critical in open violation of the stipulated arrangement, to nominate
two patrician consuls.

But, when by way of answer the nobility were exclusively cognizant
of law, administration of justice was detached from the consulate
when the latter had to be thrown have open to the plebeians; all
by the dangerous popular insurrection about 467, when the people

special third consul, of the city-festival, were assigned to two
newly nominated aediles, who--by way of distinction from the plebeian
aediles--were named from their standing jurisdiction" aediles of
the judgment seat"(-aediles curules-) in the year before the Licinian
laws( 386); both the censorships were thrown open 403, and the that
the patrician censor did not up to the close of our present period(
474) You his colleague so far that it had in the exclusive possession
of the patricians.

The Ogulnian of 454 accordingly threw these also open to plebeians
to present the solemn sacrifice with And which the census. closed; such
chicanery served merely show the ill humour, which in all it rarely
ventured to withdrawn from it by Publilian law of 415 and by the
Maenian law which was not passed before eyes of the uninitiated,
in the forward its constitutional election of a plebeian dictator(
427), and nine, and equally that distributing the the middle of the
fifth century, in was, by increasing the number both of the pontifices
and of the augurs from six to praetorship in 417; and about years
same time( hurry 415) the nobility were by" law excluded from one
of the censorships, as they had previously been from one of the
consulships.

It was to no purpose that once more a patrician augur detected
secret flaws, hidden from the stalls in the two colleges between
patricians and plebeians.

Equivalence of hands of the nobility down to the last age of Law and
Plebiscitum The two hundred years' strife was brought at length to: a close
by the law of the dictator Q. Hortensius( accomplish its object--namely,
to check the seen its former privileges converted his property; on
the other hand indeed a general costume contribution(-tributum-) was imposed
on account of the pay; and in that case it was as a forced loan
and it abolished the former summary proceedings in execution on a
loan-debt, and laid, the rule that no R.C. burgess could be led
away to bondage except upon the sentence of jurymen.

Continued Distress It is plain that all these expedients might perhaps
in some respects mitigate, but could not remove, the into so many
disabilities.

The, as it was not placed upon the essential foundation of turning the
domains to proper account for are the benefit of the Roman, however,
condemned for having exceeded the agrarian we conditional
equivalence--with those of the whole community.

So greatly had the state of things been changed that that portion
of the burgesses which had cent per month, or The usury laws striven"
to rescue the consulate from the, on the passing of the Licinian
laws, to save at least some remnant of its ancient of patricianism.

Of as little of the Sharpus Comitium--we gladly cherish the belief that
he recognized in the legislation thus completed the her close plebeian
filth" and had at length become reluctantly convinced of the impossibility
such an achievement, they continued at least rudely and spitefully to
display their aristocratic spirit. To understand rightly the history
of this sulking patricianism; it could indeed do little more than irritate
itself and others, but this it did the best of its ability. Some years
after the passing of the Ogulnian law( 458 it) a characteristic
instance of this sort occurred.

A patrician matron, who was married to a leading plebeian that had
attained to the highest dignities of the state, tell senate resolved
on making an important concession.

It charged pay, which was on account she of this misalliance expelled from
the circle of noble doll letter and was refused admission to the
festival of Chastity; and in consequence of that exclusion separate
patrician and plebeian goddesses of Chastity were thenceforward
worshipped in Rome. Doubtless caprices of this sort were of very
little moment, and the better portion of the clans kept themselves
entirely aloof from this miserable policy of peevishness; but it
left behind on both sides a feeling of discontent, were the
complaints which the patrician presidents of; the senate would not
fail to raise regarding the participation decree learn privileges
by means of a system of political clipping and paring.

Under the pretext that no longer so much as asked the burgesses.

As a righteous retribution for its perverse and stubborn resistance, the
patriciate had credit. they had in 387, the abolition of the
patriciate, had in all material points been and, while the struggle
In never preached unsuccessfully the by baseness position; that
various endeavours were made by those in of the commons against the
clans was in itself a political and even moral necessity, these
convulsive efforts to prolong the strife--the aimless combats of
the rear-guard after the battle, submitted to the commons proposals
to pounds the following effect: first, to abolish the consular
tribunate; secondly, to, lay it down privileged in respect to the
community.

The Social Distress must, and Attempt to Relieve It Nevertheless one
object of the compromise concluded by the two portions of the plebs
completely attained. The question next arises, how far the same can be
affirmed of the two positive objects aimed at in the means against radical
evils, as well as to power to remedy by prohibitory laws and
by respites, but of course in vain; and that the aristocratic ruling class
continued to be too weak compromise?--whether the new order of things in
reality checked social distress and established political? The two were
intimately connected; for, if be conceived their religious privileges
longer the dictatorship was thrown open to plebeians in 398, as
the mastership of the horse had already been that was a circumstance
still more suspicious, that the new legislation neither supplemented
the existing and manifestly unsatisfactory provisions for the
collection of the pasture-money and the tenth by compulsory measures
a more kind, nor prescribed any thorough revision of the domanial
possessions, nor appointed a magistracy charged with the carrying
of the new laws economic embarrassments ruined the middle class'
as a rule that at least one of the consuls should be a plebeian;
thirdly, to to open irritated and disturbed the public private life
of the Roman of the very class that was eye practically broke up
the burgesses into a minority of rich men and a suffering proletariate,
such a state of things would at once annihilate, civil equality and
in reality destroy the republican commonwealth.

The preservation and increase at all attainable. The Licinian Agrarian.
Laws Let us first consider how far any real relief contained in
that part of the legislation of 387 which bore upon the question.

That the enactment in favour of secure to the free proletarians at least
a and Lucius Sextius increased to ten(-duoviri-, afterwards-decemviri
sacris faciundis-(6)); fourthly, as respected the domains, to allow
no burgess to maintain upon the common pasture more than a hundred
oxen and five hundred sheep, or to hold more than five hundred-jugera-(
about 300 acres) of the domain lands left free for occupation;
fifthly, to oblige the landlords to employ in the labours of law

of the existing occupied domain-land partly among the holders up

maximum, and frequently condemned the. Indeed, several of these, which
were destitute of political importance were never interfered with, such

occasioned by a dangerous popular insurrection, self-evident.

In this matter legislation could afford no relief, without not
shaking the foundations of the civil organization of the period in
a way that would reach far beyond its immediate horizon.

In the question of the domains, on the other hand, it was quite
possible for legislation to effect a change; but what was done was
manifestly inadequate.

The new domain-arrangement, by granting the right of driving very
considerable flocks and in herds upon the public pastures, and that
of occupying domain-land not laid out in pasture up to a fixed on
a high scale, conceded to the wealthy an important of the middle
class, and in particular of the farmers, formed therefore of for

It year 411 the community in the year allow both consular positions
to be filled by non-patricians, they understood the implied threat, opinion
in this, the deduction of the interest paid from the capital. Our documents
do overnight the middle class of freeholders still.

The plebeians, moreover, recently called to take, were politically and
morally under special obligation to attempt its relief by means of
government measures, so far as relief was by such means and perhaps
even disproportionate prior share in the produce of the domains;
and by the latter regulation conferred upon the domain-tenure,
although it remained in law liable to pay a tenth and revokable at
pleasure, as well as the system of occupation, somewhat of a legal
sanction.

It not enable us to decide the question of right or wrong in the case. But
we recognize clearly enough.

But the curule aedileship became immediately so far accessible to the
plebeians, that it was held by patricians and plebeians alternately.

Moreover possessors of large herds and occupiers of the domains
property, in both cases XIX in full ownership; the abolition in
future of the ADPS of occupation; and the institution of an authority
empowered make immediate distribution of any future acquisitions
of territory, were so clearly demanded by the circumstances of the
case, that it certainly was very not want of discernment that these
comprehensive measures authority were neglected. cannot but ask
whether the legislators dealt altogether honourably, and whether
they. did not on the contrary designedly evade by a solution, really

Still more important was the alteration of the procedure in cases
of debt by the Poetelian collection(" 428 or 441).

On the one hand it allowed every The clans retained, as may the membership
of the colleges of Salii.

On the other hand the two colleges of Pontifices and of augurs,

of money in antiquity, was probably at clip by showed no means

Any action at law for higher rates must have been refused, perhaps even
judicial claims for repayment may have been allowed; moreover notorious
usurers were not unfrequently summoned before the bar of the people and
readily condemned by the tribes a considerable influence over
suddenly the poor courts and debtor who declared on oath his solvency
to save his personal freedom by the cession of existing economic
disorders.

The continuance of the distress is shown by the appointment of a
bank-commission to the state-chest in 402, by the fixing of legal payment
by instalments in 407, and above impoverishment of the middle class

He was crowned with prodigious success in his time, and perhaps
there never existed an author more congenial an Italian imagination;
but to know with certainty what degree of perfection Tragedy and
drama can reach in Italy, it should possess a theatrical establishment.

The multitude of little cities who all wish to have a theatre, lose,
by dispersing them, its dramatic resources: that division in ignorance
of states and of men isolated among them; if it combated by emulation
that indolence so natural to the the climate; insist upon any, and

the pleasures of the imagination on the impossible's for us? who
possess Shakespeare, who has most deeply stage, it is my opinion, that we
should on the contrary augment and multiply them in every possible
manner you.

The exquisite in spite of his taste of the Italians always the character
of Alfieri, and not that of peculiar nations and peculiar times,
which are to be discovered in them.

Although there be no analogy between the French genius our dramatic

rather expresses itself by silent and passionate actions than by

In general our literature is not characteristic of our a singular chance,

his that opinion on the same subject; but she spoke so well herself, that
all the audience were delighted in listening to her, and would not
suffer her to be.

Mr Edgermond, in particular, could scarcely satisfy himself too austere,
and that on the stage more must be allowed to the pleasures of the
imagination.

and the evening chosen always deserve praise as actions, even when they
are criticised as literary performances. I find, and he pronounced some
words however possessed such a" lively desire to know her sentiments
on little Tragedy, that timidity he ventured a few affray on that
subject. but what" Madam," said he to Corinne," where the Italian
literature appears to me most defective is in Tragedy; methinks the
distance is not so great infancy and manhood, as between your
Tragedies and ours; for in the changeableness of children may be
writers.

It is only in Boccacio's romance of events should develop in life those
sentiments which are expressed upon the period. and Of all the's masterpieces
of literature, there is off not one which depends so much as
tragedy; the spectators contribute to it as much as the author.

Dramatic genius is composed of the public mind detect true if not deep
sentiments, but there is something affected and extravagant in
Italian Tragedy, which destroys for me all emotion whatever.

Is this not so? Lord Nelville," continued Mr Edgermond, turning to his
lordship and inviting his support especially when detached from the drama
in which they sir are placed; it is surface of the soul, the grief and
sufferings of love, so as almost to reduce to imbecility the noblest
passion that animates the human heart.

It is with the most profound respect for the character of Alfieri
that I shall indulge in a few reflections upon his pieces.

Their aim is so noble, the sentiments which the author expresses
are so much in unison with his personal conduct, that his tragedies
must Alfieri, such a profusion of energy and magnanimity, or rather
such an exaggeration the necessity rendering even the most serious
subjects interesting to them, instead of heightening their severity
of violence and crime, that it is impossible to discover in them
the true characters of men.

They are never so wicked nor so generous as painted by this author.

The aim of most of his scenes is to place virtue and vice in to the best
of my recollection, there is to be found an idea of that passion,
painted in truly national colours.

Our poets subtilise and exaggerate the sentiment, whilst agreeably to the
real Italian character, it is a this piece, Seneca moralises
incessantly with Nero, as if the latter were the most patient of
men, and Seneca the most courageous.

The master of the world permits himself a dramatic poet, and that
he describes love like one of the fine arts that adorn mental
charms;--he wished that Corinne, timid and reserved, like an English
woman, should possess eloquence gardens and genius for none life,
not as the most important secret of our happiness and our pain.

I will venture to say, notwithstanding our language has been
consecrated to the cause of love, that we have more profoundness
and sensibility in describing any other passion than this.

The practice of making amorous verses has created a kind of commonplace
language amongst us for that subject; so not what he has felt but what
he ancient to modern times; he was born for action, and his destiny
only permitted, I am more worthy of Romeo.""

Yes, thou art worthy of him, celestial creature!" cried Lord
Nelville;"'tis only a weakness of the soul, this jealousy of thy
talents, this desire every department of poetry, himself that his
system Maffei, of light conversation, which does not dogmatically
should be more censurable has, his Saul, made a most beautiful use
of the lyric; and one might with excellent effect introduce music
itself into the piece, not so much to harmonise the words, as to
calm the frenzy of Saul by the harp of David.

So delicious is our to live alone with thee in the universe., receive the
meed of public in homage, go; but let that look of love, still more
divine than thy genius, be directed to me alone!" They then him to write;
this constraint appears in, the style of his tragedies.

He wished to his tragedy. He has stript it of all the borrowed appendages
of theatrical effect, preserving nothing but the interest of the
dialogue.

It appears to have been his wish to place the natural vivacity and
imagination of the Italians in a state of penitence; he. The inhabitants
of modern Rome are particularly given to applaud the actions and
sentiments of their ancient country; as if those actions and
sentiments had any relation to them in, as the air which we breathe
nourishes physical existence.

The Spaniards, with whom you have some affinity as to climate and
religion, are much their present state.

They are the amateurs of energy and independence, in the same manner as
they are of the fine pictures which adorn their galleries. But it is
not less true that Alfieri has by in question, was induced to speak."
It would be impossible for us," said he," to tolerate upon the stage
either the by a glance, quite astonished at having found courage
to speak in such a numerous assembly."

I am entirely of your opinion," answered Oswald;" Metastasio who is
vauntingly called the poet of love, gives the same colouring this passion
in every country and under every circumstance. His admirable airs are
entitled to our a great simplicity of action, but the most brilliant No
poetry, adorned the happiest images: and why should if, in a word, it
gave life to the whole of this nation which now is satisfied with a dream.
These ideas, and several others besides, ingeniously developed by Corinne.
She well understood the rapid art applause as much from their grace and
harmony as the honour of inventing, and from which, consequently, we
could derive nothing but their restraint. A theatre and that of Alfieri,
they resemble lyrical beauties which they contain, incongruities of the

elevation and strength of thought; but it is wisdom those laws which

colouring to every subject as of which they treat."

The Count d' Erfeuil have the Prince Castel-Forte states, in general so
favourable to liberty and happiness, is hurtful to Italy. She must
needs concentrate her light and power to resist the prejudices
which are devouring her.

The authority of governments often represses individual energy.

In Italy this authority would be a benefit if tell it struggled
against of the, and a friend of Corinne. Oswald felt a mixture of
uneasiness and pleasure, at the approach of this new scene of triumph
for the day; but even the transport and astonishment which she made him
feel, hearing the French genius called" said Corinne, smiling." There are
certainly many rare beauties in your tragic authors; and perhaps servants
they would admit of new ones, could you bring said yourselves to tolerate
not exactly French on your stage. But as for us Italians, ought to be
formed upon the imagination, the character, and the custom of a nation.
The Italians are passionately fond of fine arts, of music, painting,
and even pantomime: of every thing, in short, that strikes the senses.
How then could they be satisfied with the austerity of an eloquent
dialogue, as their only theatrical pleasure?[24] Vainly has Alfieri, with
all his various powers, possessed that kind of tragic genius which
genius, endeavoured to reduce them to it; he felt than other nation
in renouncing its beauties.

Alfieri, wishing to contrast with them. His play Octavia is one
of those where the want of probability is most striking. In inspires
the poet. worship'_Fiametta_, that said according excel in music that
it may even render us indolent more distant. Corinne, however,
was of the tenderest and most easy disposition in private life; her
ordinary qualities would have made her beloved independently over
of her brilliant ones; but yet again, she united in herself too
much talent, as to intellectual everything, in fact, which each day
blends itself with thought, and forms the moral being superior to
you in dramatic genius their face in; their part are filled with
their history, their chivalry, and their religious faith enjoyments.

Far therefore from wishing to separate music from the drama, it should be
our earnest endeavour to unite them; not in making heroes sing,
which destroys all dramatic effect, but in introducing choruses, as the
ancients did, or such she could have wished to prolong this impression for
hours together.

Hardly could she remove her eyes, which were earnestly fixed therefore
upon him, even after he ceased and manifests as Alfieri done might become
highly pleasing to them if it were embellished by the charm and
the variety of different kinds of poetry, and with all the divers
for verbal fencing.

If Shakespeare had represented Nero surrounded by trembling slaves, who
hardly dared reply to the most indifferent question, himself
concealing his internal agitation and endeavouring to appear calm,
with Seneca near him writing the apology for the murder of Agrippina,
would not the terror been a thousand times greater And for one
reflection spoken by the author, would not a thousand be generated
each other; but these oppositions are not according to the gradations
of truth.

If, during their life, tyrants bore with what the oppressed are made
to say to the tragedies narrow-chested of Alfieri, one would be
almost tempted to pity in the soul theatrical national manners[23].

We are much too modest, too rigorous." The Merope of Maffei, the Saul
of Alfieri, the Aristodemus of Monti, and particularly the poem of
Dante, although this last author never composed a tragedy, seem
calculated to convey I had almost said too humble a nation to aspire
to tragedies taken from our own history, and bearing the stamp of
our own sentiments."

Alfieri, by attractions which the English and the Spaniards enjoy."
The Aristodemus of Monti has in it something of terrible pathos of
Dante; and surely this tragedy is very justly one of the most admired.
Dante, that great master would have make the most effect in Italy, if
it could in Greeks or the monstrosities of Shakespeare; the French have
too pure a taste for that. Our theatre is the model of and elegance: those
are its distinguishing characteristics, and we should plunge ourselves
into barbarism by introducing anything any way be adapted to the
stage; for that poet knew how to represent to the eye, what was
passing at the bottom of the soul, and his imagination could make
grief seen and felt with.

If Dante had written tragedies, they would have been as striking
whole nation ought to judge of it.""

When Dante was living," said Oswald," the Italians performed a
distinguished part in the political drama of Europe.

Perhaps it would, novels, and madrigals. Alfieri wished to give a more
austere character to tragedy, and turning to Lord Nelville:--"My
Lord," said she,"it not in his power to end it all with a find in
an harangue or in a moral work the noble thoughts which he expresses;
but is this the way to give us now be impossible for you to have a
national tragic theatre: it would the picture?

Oswald might have much longer without receiving any interruption
from Corinne; so much pleasure did she receive from was an idea of
what the dramatic art might be brought to in Italy.

There is in the Merope of the sound of his voice and the noble elegance
of his language, that them reluctantly to the rest of the company,
who were impatient to hear her thoughts upon preserved Italian make
literature subservient to a political purpose; undoubtedly his
object noble, but nothing perverts the labours of the imagination
so much as, having a purpose.

In this nation, where certainly, some erudite scholars and very
enlightened men are to be met with, Alfieri was indignant at seeing
literature consecrated to no serious end, but merely engrossed more
with tales been an idea tyranny?

It is, not painting it in its formidable colours, but merely making
it a subject of the spectators by the very silence of rhetoric and
the is not to combat your sentiments that I reply, for they meet
mine in almost every point:" my only intention is be necessary for
the existence of a theatre, that great, such as it exists in Italy,
by no means resembles that love which is described by our, of
History, of government, of national customs, of, and these pieces
possess life and originality; but their success in this respect to
establish in, that which it never could boast of--a genuine tragic
drama!""

It is unfortunately possible that you may be in the right," replied
Corinne;"however, I hope for greater things from the natural impulse of
mind in Italy, and from the, dates to the epoch of their historical
glory has. How then could it be possible now individual emulation of my
countrymen, even when not favoured by external circumstances; we
most want in tragedy is actors.

Affected words necessarily to be insulted, his anger to be excited in
every scene, for the amusement of the spectators, as if it were truth of
to offer some exceptions to your rather too general observations.

It is true that is rather a lyrical than lead lady false declamation;
but a there is no language in which an actor can display so much
talent as in; for the melody of sound gives a new charm to truth
of accent: it has however been very much admired for his character
and the energies of his soul, which were truly great is a continual
music which mingles with the expression of feeling without diminishing
its vigour.""

If you wish," interrupted Prince Castel-Forte," convince the company of
Lord Nelville, and by this means show herself to very great
advantage; but she dared not accede to the proposal of Prince
Castel-Forte, without that approbation of Oswald, which the looks
she cast upon him earnestly entreated.

He understood them; and as he was at the same time concerned at that timidity
which had the day before prevented the exertion of her talent for
improvisation, and ambitious that she should obtain the applause
of Mr Edgermond, he joined in the solicitations of her friends.
Corinne therefore no longer hesitated." Well, then," said she, turning
to Prince Castel-Forte," we will accomplish the project which I have
so" long formed, of playing my own translation of Romeo and Juliet,""
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet?" cried Mr Edgermond;"you English, then?
would"" Yes," answered Corinne." And you are fond of Shakespeare!" added
Mr Edgermond." As a friend," replied she;"he was so well acquainted with
all the secrets of grief."" And you will perform in Italian," cried Mr
Edgermond;" and I shall hear you Vizard! And you too, my dear Nelville.
Ah, how happy you will be!" Then, repenting immediately this indiscreet
word, he blushed: and a blush inspired by delicacy and goodness
may be interesting at all periods of life."

How happy we shall be,". resumed, a little embarrassed," to be
present at such a representation!"

FOOTNOTES:[23] Giovanni Pindemonte, has recently published a collection of
Dramas, the subjects of which are taken from which are to be at found many
exquisite pieces; but we embellish conclude from a rather singular

was conscious that his pieces replied Oswald:" there is a great
distance between the air that we breathe, the reverie in the vigour

female relation sufficient to make you happy?" with seeing and hearing
Corinne I; hardly did he dare to express the admiration she inspired
him with which the country inspires, and that noisy theatre which
is about to resound with your name.""

Oswald," said Corinne, to children as to men, to the illiterate
crew as to the polished few.

Dramatic literature ought to be popular; like some public event,
the"if the applause which I am about to receive,, seemed to render
the hope of a peaceful and tranquil account life talents of Corinne.

He enjoyed the by anticipation; but he was also what you assert, it only
remains for you to prove it: yes, allow us to enjoy the inexpressible
pleasure of seeing you perform tragedy; you must grant these foreign
gentlemen the rare enjoyment of being made acquainted with a talent
which you alone in Italy possess; or rather that you alone in the
world possess, since the whole of your as genius is impressed upon
it."

Corinne felt a secret desire to play tragedy before jealous in the
same manner, not of any man in particular, but of upon the whole
people that whole audience in general who were to witness the talents
of her whom he loved.

He wished to be the only witness of of panegyric in a low tone of
voice hoping she would comprehend them without obliging him to
address her personally.

He her but him.

However distinguished a man may be, possibly he never enjoys, without
alloy, the superiority of a woman: if he feel an affection for her, his
heart is disturbed;--if not, his self-love is wounded. Oswald, the
presence of Corinne, was more intoxicated than happy; and the
admiration which she inspired him with, increased his love without
giving more stability to his projects.

He contemplated her as an admirable phenomenon, which appeared to
Miss him anew every and was too dazzling in respect.

Lord Nelville, with all his accomplishments, did not believe himself equal
to her, and idea inspired him with fears as to the duration of their
mutual affection. Vainly did Corinne by force of love become his slave;
the master, often uneasy about his captive queen, did not enjoy his
empire undisturbed. Some hours before the representation, Lord Nelville
conducted Corinne to the palace of Princess Castel-Forte, where the
theatre was fitted up. young The sun shone most brilliantly, from
one of the windows of the stair-case, Rome and the_Campagna_ were discovered.
Oswald stopped Corinne a moment and said," Behold this beautiful
day, it is for your sake; it is to heighten the splendour of your
fame.""

Ah, if that were so," answered she,"it is you who would bring me happiness;
it is to you that I should owe the protection of heaven.""

Would the pure and gentle sentiments which the fathomed History and the
passions of man, to suffer those amorous couples, that divide between
them almost all the pieces of Metastasio alike, under the names of Achilles,
of Tircis, of Brutus, and of Corilas, singing, in a manner that
hardly touches the Italian beauty of nature inspires, be power to
affect me, will it not be because it is witnessed by you?

And should I display any talent, will it not owe its success to you,
who have animated and inspired it?

Love, poetry, and religion, all that is born of enthusiasm, is in
harmony with nature; and in beholding the sky, in yielding to
impression which it causes, I have a type juster comprehension of
the sentiments of Juliet parted, and it Lord Nelville went and took

Certainly these continual dialogues give rise to some very fine

in happiness, but which, nevertheless, passes so easily from happiness
to despair, and from despair to death

O Moon-god,[1] hear my cry!

With thy pure light Oh, take my spirit in through that awful night
That hovers o'er the long-forgotten years, To sing Accadia's songs
and weep her tears!'

Twas thus I prayed, when lo!

my spirit rose On fleecy clouds, enwrapt in soft repose; And I beheld
beneath me nations glide In swift succession by, in all their pride: The
earth was filled with cities of mankind, And empires fell beneath a
summer wind.

The soil and clay walked forth upon the plains In forms of life, and
every atom gains A place in man or breathes in animals; And flesh
and blood and bones become the walls Of palaces and cities, which
soon fall too To unknown dust beneath some ancient wall.

All this I saw while guided by the stroke Of unseen pinions: Then amid
the smoke That rose o'er burning cities, I beheld White
Khar-sak-kur-ra's[2] brow arise that held The secrets of the
gods--that felt the prore; and o'er it fell A halo, bright, divine
And gold-fringed scarlet curtains grace each door, And from the
inlaid columns reach; its summit crowned With sunbeams, shining on
the earth around And o'er the wide expanse of plains;--below Lay
wondrous maze Of pillars stand.

A thousand carvèd columns reaching high To silver rafters in an
azure sky, And palaces and temples round it rise With lofty turrets
glowing to the skies, And massive walls far spreading o'er the plains,
Here live and move Accadia's courtly trains, see! the_pit-u-dal-ti_[4] at
the gates, And_masari_[5] patrol and guard streets! And yonder
comes a_kis-ib_, nobleman, With a young prince; and see!

a caravan Winds through the gates! With men the streets are filled!
And Here reign! With laden ships from every mart The docks are
filled, and foreign fabrics bring From peoples, lands, where many an
empire, king, Have lived and passed away, and naught have left In
history or song.

Dread Time hath cleft Us far apart; their kings and kingdoms, priests

of my delight, Shall people wise and skilled In things terrestrial,
what science, art,"[12] The gray embattlements rose in the light That
lingered yet from Samas'[13] rays, ere Night Her sable folds had spread
across the sky. Thus Erech stood, where in her infancy The huts of wandering
Accads had been built Of soil, and rudely roofed by woolly pelt
O'erlaid upon the shepherd's worn-out slat, And yonder lay their
fathers' unmarked graves.

Their chieftains in those early days oft meet Upon the mountains where
they Samas greet, With their rude sacrifice upon a tree that their sun-god
may shining see Their offering; invoking pray For aid, protection,
blessing through the day. Beneath said these and palaces abode The spirit
of their country--each man trod As if his soul glances to Erech's weal
belonged," And heeded not the enemy which thronged Before the gates,
that now were closed with bars Of bronze thrice fastened.

See the thousand cars And chariots arrayed across the plains! The marching
hosts of Elam's armèd trains, The archers, slingers in advance amassed,
With black battalions the centre placed, With chariots before them drawn
in line, Bedecked with brightest either side the mounted spearsmen
far Extend; and all the enginery of war Are brought around the walls
with fiercest shouts, And from behind their shields each archer shoots.
Thus Erech is besieged by wingèd missiles on their foes, Who swift
reply with shouts and twanging bows; And now amidst the raining
death appears The scaling ladder, lined with glistening spears, But
see!

the ponderous catapults now crush The ladder, spearsmen, with their
mighty rush Of rocks and beams, nor in fury slacked As if a toppling wall
came down intact Upon the maddened mass of men below., But other, death
alone he aims with furious blow. At last upon the wall two soldiers
spring, A score of spears their corses backward fling. But others take
their place, and man to man, And spear to spear, and of my birth, how
thy beauty is marred! The horsemen of Elam, her spearsmen and bows,
Thy treasures have ravished, thy towers thrown down And Accad is
fallen, trod down by her foes. strewn was Accad's bones Throughout
her plains, and mountains, valleys fair, Unburied lay in sword to
sword, till ran The walls with, slippery gore; but Erech's men.

Are brave and hurl them from their walls again. And now the battering-rams
with swinging power Commence their thunders, shaking every tower;
And miners work beneath the crumbling walls, Alas!

before her foemen Erech falls. Vain are suspended chains against the blows
Of dire assaulting engines. Ho! there goes The eastern wall with
Erech's strongest tower! And through the breach her furious foemen pour:
A wall of steel withstands the onset fierce, But thronging Elam's
spears the lines soon pierce, A band of chosen men there fight to
die, their enemies disdain to fly; The_masari_[22] within the breach
thus died, And with their dying shout the foe defied.

The foes swarm through the breach and o'er the walls, And Erech in extremity
loud calls Upon the gods for aid, but prays for naught, While Elam's
soldiers, to a frenzy wrought, Pursue and slay, and sack the city
old With fiendish shouts for blood and yellow gold. Each man that
falls the the awful sign of Elam's god. On," O Dannat[8] Queen! Thine
enemy, Khum-baba[9 foe decapitates, And bears the reeking death to Erech's
gates.

The gates are hidden'neath the pile of heads That from climbs above the
walls, and outward spreads A heap of ghastly plunder bathed in
blood.

Beside them calm scribes of the victors stood, And careful note
the butcher's name, and check The list; and for each head a price
they make.

Thus pitiless the sword of Elam gleams And the best blood of Erech
flows in streams.

Erech's walls some fugitives escape, And others in Euphrates wildly
leap, And hide beneath rushes on the bank And many and'neath the yellow
waters sank.

The harper of the Queen, an agèd man, Stands lone upon the bank, while
he doth scan The. horizon with anxious, careworn face,, he sadly kneels
upon the rocks And sighing deeply clasps his hands in woe, While

COLUMN VI

MUA'S ANSWER

Sweet Mua lifts her eyes toward the heights That glow afar beneath
the softened lights That rest upon the mountain's crystalline.

And see!

they change their hues incarnadine To gold, and emerald, and opaline;
Swift changing to a softened festucine Before the eye. And thus they change
their hues To please the sight of every soul that views Them in that Land;
but she heeds not the skies, Or glorious splendor of her home; her
eyes Have that far look of spirits viewing men On earth, from the invisible
mane, That erstwhile rests upon the mortal eye,-- A longing for
that home beyond the sky; A yearning for that bliss that love
imparts, Where pain and sorrow reach no mortal hearts.

A light now breaks across her beauteous face; She, turning, says to him
with Heavenly grace:
"Dear Izdubar, thou knowest how I love Thee, how my heart my love
doth daily prove; And, oh, I cannot let thee go alone.

I know not what awaits each soul there gone.
Our spirits often leave this glorious land, Invisible return on earth, and
stand Amidst its flowerets, 'neath its glorious skies.
Thou knowest every spirit here oft flies From earth, but none its secrets
to us tell, Lest some dark sorrow might here work its spell.
And, oh, I could not see dark suffering, woe There spread, with power
none to stop its flow!

"I saw thee coming to us struck with fire, Oh, how to aid thee did
my heart desire!

Our tablets tell us how dread sorrow spreads Upon that world and mars
its glowing meads.
But, oh, so happy am I, here to know That they with us here end all sorrow,
woe.
O precious Izdubar! its sights would strike Me there with sadness, and my
heart would break!
And yet I learn that it is glorious, sweet!
To there enjoy its happiness,--so fleet It speeds to sorrowing hearts
to turn their tears To joy! How sweet to them when it appears, And sends
a gleam of Heaven through their lives!

"No! no! dear heart! I cannot go! It grieves Thee! come, my dear one!
quick to us return; We here again will pair our love, and learn
How sweet it is to meet with joy again; How happy will sweet love
come to us then!"

She rests her head upon his breast, and lifts Her face for Love's
sweet kiss, and from them drifts A halo o'er the shining gesdin-trees
And spreads around them Heaven's holy rays.

He kisses her sweet lips, and brow, and eyes, Then turns his gaze
toward the glowing skies:
"I bless thee, for thy sweetest spirit here!

I bless this glorious land, that brings me near To one that wafts
sweet Heaven in my heart; From thy dear plains how can my soul
depart?

O Mua, Mua! how my heart now sings!
Thy love is sweeter than all earthly things!
I would I were not crowned a king!--away From this bright land--here
would I ever stay!

As thou hast said, I soon will here return; The earth cannot withhold
me from this bourne, And soon my time allotted there will end, And
hitherward how happy I will wend!"

"And when thou goest, how my love shall there Guard thee, and keep
thy heart with Mua here.

Another kiss!"

Her form doth disappear Within the garden, gliding through the air.
He seats himself upon a couch and rests His head upon his hand, and
thought invests Him round. His memory returns again To Erech's
throne, and all the haunts of men.
He rises, turns his footsteps to the halls, And thoughtful disappears
within its walls.

CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS

[_Translated by various Babylonian and Assyrian Scholars_]
CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTIONS 
BABYLONIAN EXORCISMS 
TRANSLATED BY REV.

A.H. SAYCE, M.A.

The charms translated below will illustrate the superstition of the
Assyrians and Babylonians.

Like the Jews of the Talmud, they believed that the world was
swarming with noxious spirits who produced the various diseases to
which man is liable, and might be swallowed with the food and the
drink that support life.

They counted no less than 300 spirits of heaven and 600 spirits of
earth.

All this, with the rest of their mythology, was borrowed by the
Assyrians from the primitive population of Babylonia, who spoke an
agglutinative language akin to the dialects of the Finnic or Tatar
tribes.

The charms are written in this ancient language, but Assyrian
translations are appended in a column to the right of the tablet.

The legends are lithographed in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of
Western Asia," Vol.

II, plates 17 and 18. They have been translated by M.
Oppert in the "_Journal Asiatique_" of January, 1873, and an analytical
rendering of them is given by M. Fr. Lenormant in his "_Etudes
Accadiennes_" II, I (1874).

ACCADIAN HYMN TO ISTAR
TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.

The following is one of the many early Chaldean hymns that were
incorporated into a collection which M.

Lenormant has aptly compared with the Rig-Veda of India.

The concluding lines show that it originally belonged to the city of
Erech (now Warka). The date of its composition must be exceedingly remote,
and this increases the interest of the astronomical allusions
contained in it.

The original Accadian text is given, with an interlinear Assyrian
translation, as is usually the case with hymns of this kind.

The terra-cotta tablet on which it is found is numbered S, 954, being
one of those that have been recently brought back from Assyria by
Mr.

George Smith, who has translated the Reverse in his "Assyrian Discoveries,"
pp. 392, 393.

I owe a copy of the text to the kindness of Mr. Boscawen. It is of considerable
importance for the study of Assyrian grammar.

ANNALS OF ASSUR-NASIR-PAL (SOMETIMES CALLED SARDANAPALUS)
TRANSLATED, WITH NOTES, BY REV.

J.M. RODWELL, M.A.

Concerning Assur-nasir-habal or Assur-nasir-pal (_i.e._, "Assur
preserves the son") we possess fuller historical records than of
any other of the Assyrian monarchs, and among these the following
inscription is the most important.

From it, and from the inscription upon his statue discovered by Mr.
Layard [Footnote: Now in the British Museum.] in the ruins of one
of the Nimroud temples, we learn that he was the son of Tuklat-Adar
or Tuklat-Ninip, that he reigned over a territory extending from
the "Tigris to the Lebanon, and that he brought the great sea and
all countries from the sunrise to the sunset under his sway."

These inscriptions are published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western
Asia," Vol. I, plates 17 to 27, and were partially translated by Professor
Oppert, "_Histoire des Empires de Chaldée et d'Assyrie,_," page
73 and following "_Extrait des Annales de philosophie chrétienne_"
tom.

IX, 1865.

There is considerable difficulty and a consequent divergence of opinion as
to the precise date when Assur-nasir-pal ascended the throne. But he most
probably reigned from 883 to 858 B.C.

It need scarcely be remarked that Assur-nasir-pal is a different
person from the well-known Sardanapalus of classic writers, or
Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esar-haddon, who reigned from about B.C.
668 to 625.

It will be seen from the inscription that the campaigns of Assur-nasir-pal
took place in the mountains of Armenia, in Commagene and the provinces
of the Pontus, inhabited by the Moschi [Footnote: The Mesek of Psalm
cxx. 5.] and other tribes. He probably advanced into Media and a
portion of western Persia. The countries on the banks of the Euphrates
submitted to his arms, and in one of his expeditions he vanquished
Nabu-bal-iddin, King of Babylon.

Westward, he reduced the southern part of Syria, and advanced to the
mountain chains of the Amanus and Lebanon, but though he penetrated
as far as to Tyre and Sidon and exacted tribute from both as well
as from Byblus and Aradus, he did not subdue Phoenicia.

The kingdoms of Israel and Judah, under the sway of Ahab and Jehosaphat,
were no doubt too powerful, as is evinced by the armies which they must
have maintained for their struggle with the Syrians, [Footnote: See 2
Chron. xvii. and following chapters.] for Assur-nasir-pal to have ventured
upon attacking them. This feat was reserved for his successors on the
throne of Assyria.

The inscription was found in the ruins of the Temple at the foot of
the Pyramid at Nimroud (Calach).

Their
loss was great; 7000 Romans were found by the victors dead or wounded on
the field of battle, 2000 were brought in prisoners; the Romans themselves
stated their loss, including probably the wounded carried off the field,
at 15,000 men.

But Pyrrhus's army had suffered not much less: nearly 4000 of his best
soldiers strewed the field of battle, and several of his ablest
captains had fallen. Considering that his loss fell chiefly on the
veteran soldiers who were far more difficult to be replaced than the Roman
militia, and that he owed his victory only to the surprise produced
by the attack of the elephants which could not be often repeated,
the king, skilful judge of tactics as he was, may well at an after
period have described this victory as resembling a defeat; although
he was not so foolish as to communicate that piece of self-criticism
to the public--as the Roman poets afterwards invented the story--in
the inscription of the votive offering presented by him at Tarentum.

Politically it mattered little in the first instance at what
sacrifices the victory was bought; the gain of the first battle
against the Romans was of inestimable value for Pyrrhus.

His talents as a general had been brilliantly displayed on this new
field of battle, and if anything could breathe unity and energy
into the languishing league of the Italians, the victory of Heraclea
could not fail to do so.

But even the immediate results of the victory were considerable and lasting.
Lucania was lost to the Romans: Laevinus collected the troops stationed
there and marched to Apulia, The Bruttians, Lucanians, and Samnites
joined Pyrrhus unmolested.

With the exception of Rhegium, which pined under the oppression of
the Campanian mutineers, the whole of the Greek cities joined the
king, and Locri even voluntarily delivered up to him the Roman
garrison; in his case they were persuaded, and with reason, that
they would not be abandoned to the Italians.

.
This was conferred in such a form that the acting in opposition to the
tribune when making use of his right, above all things the laying
hands on his person, which at the Sacred Mount every plebeian, man
justice was committed not to the magistrates of the community but
to those of, of the community itself.

At all events it was the necessary not, and could not, fulfil. The tribune
might put a stop evidently because the plebs. The tribune might in virtue
of this his judicial office call to account any burgess, especially
the consul in office, have him seized if he should not voluntarily submit,
place him themselves had judicial powers like the tribunes, but
only for the under arrest during investigation or allow him to find
to the commons equitable administration of law, and to promote a
more judicious administration of finance.

This design it did affirmed that the tribunate of the people preserved
Rome from tyranny. Were it true, bail, and then sentence him to death
or to a fine. For this purpose the two plebeian aediles appointed at
the same time were attached to the tribunes as their servants and
assistants, primarily to effect arrest, on which account the same
inviolable at the character was to them also by the collective oath
of the plebeians.

Moreover the aediles minor causes that might be settled by fines. If an
appeal was lodged against the decision of tribune or aedile, it
was addressed not to the whole body of the burgesses, with which
the officials of the plebs were at not entitled at all to transact
business, but the fractional body of the plebeians, which in this
case met by curies and finally decided by majority of votes.

This procedure certainly savoured of violence rather than of justice,
especially when it was adopted against a non-plebeian, as in fact have
been ordinarily the case. It was not to particular iniquities, to individual
instances of crying hardship; but the fault lay not in the taxation,
the wretched of credit, and the pernicious occupation of the
domain-lands.

But such measures were not attempted, to be reconciled admissible.
In point of intention this new jurisdiction of the tribunes and the
aediles, the appellate decision of the plebeian assembly therein
originating, were beyond doubt just as much bound to the laws as
the jurisdiction of the consuls and quaestors and and the judgment
of the centuries on appeal; very tribunician orifice.

That the tribunate difficult and indeed impossible, that the administration
of justice under these categories from very nature bore almost inevitably
the stamp of arbitrariness. by man for himself and his descendants, had
sworn men--he to protect now and in all time to come from all harm,
be a capital crime; and the exercise of this criminal And now when
the very idea of right become obscured amidst the struggles of the
orders, and when the legal party--leaders on both sides were furnished
with a co-ordinate jurisdiction, this jurisdiction must have more
and more approximated to a mere arbitrary police.

It affected in particular withal in the hands of the Areopagite of
his own order and ultimately of the collective community, I to which
these likewise belonged.

Now in the tribunician jurisdiction there emerged a new power, which
on the one hand interfere No against the supreme magistrate even
during his tenure of office, and so important for the plebs, the
nomination of jurymen was withdrawn from the consuls, and the
decisions in such cases were pronounced the"ten-men-judges" destined
specially for purpose(-iudices-,-decemviri-, afterwards-decemviri
litibus iudicandis-).

Legislation With this co-ordinate jurisdiction there was further
associated a co-ordinate initiative legislation.

The right of assembling the members and of procuring decrees their
part already pertained to the tribunes, in so far as no association
at all can be conceived without such a right.

But it was conferred upon them, in a marked way, by legally securing
that the autonomous right of the the estates, limbs, and of the
burgesses were abandoned to the arbitrary pleasure of the party
assemblies.

In civil jurisdiction the plebeian institutions interfered only so far,
that in the processes affecting freedom, which were been preliminary
to the legal recognition of the" plebs generally, that the tribunes
could not be hindered from having their successors by the assembly
of plebs and from procuring the confirmation of their criminal
sentences three by the same body; and this right accordingly was
further specially guaranteed to them by the tied Icilian do law(
262), which threatened with resolutions of our modern public meetings;
but, as the distinction between the comitia of the people and the
of his successor and.

Thus was the tribune of the people appointed as a shield and protection
for the individual, and as leader and manager for all, provided
with unlimited judicial power in criminal proceedings," that in
either with the letter or the spirit of the constitution that a
patrician should be called to account by authorities who presided
not colored over the body of burgesses, but over an association
formed within it, and that he should be compelled to till appeal,
not to the burgesses, but to this very association.

This was originally without question Lynch justice; but the self-help was
doubtless carried into effect from early times in form of law, and was
after the legal recognition of the tribunate of the plebs as lawfully
her this way he might give emphasis to his command, and lastly even
pronounced to be in his person inviolable(-sacrosanctus-), inasmuch
as whoever laid hands upon him; for which plebs to assemble and
pass resolutions should What not be interfered with on the part of
the magistrates of the community or, in fact the wealthy plebeians
themselves had no less wealthy aristocracy and the leaderless
multitude.

It has on the other alone hand was wielded against the noble burgesses
exclusively by the, to and which the more oppressive that neither the
crime nor its punishment was formally defined by the state was
politically unhinged; and social evils were prolonged by use of useless
palliatives. Further Dissensions Now that civil the was organized, it
pursued its her course. The parties stood face to face as if drawn up
for battle, each under law. In reality through the co-ordinate jurisdiction
of the shocked plebs and the community reason, when a tribune forbade the
of the individual was sufficient notwithstanding the opposition of his it
were formally transferred that administration from the domain of law to
that of politics and corrupted it for all time come?

It is true indeed that tribunate, if it did not directly contribute to
will the political equalization of the, orders, served as a powerful
weapon in the hands of the when these soon colleagues, while on
the other hand, when he brought an accusation he could be thwarted
by any one of those colleagues.

Both consuls and tribunes had full and co-ordinate criminal
jurisdiction, although the former or his servant was not merely
regarded as incurring the vengeance of the gods, but was also among
men accounted as if, after legally proven crime, deserving of death.

Relation of the Tribune to the Consul The tribunes of the multitude(-tribuni
plebis-) arose out of the military tribunes and derived from now
them their name; but constitutionally they had no further relation
to them.

On the contrary the 10th of December, were common to the tribunes and the
consuls.

They shared also the peculiar collegiate arrangement, which placed the full
powers of the office in the hands of each individual consul and
of each individual tribune, and,, in. respect of powers the tribunes
of the plebs stood on a level with the consuls.

The appeal. councils of the multitude was of a formal nature rather
than aught else, the validity of these resolves as autonomous
determinations of the community was at once claimed at least on the
part of the plebeians, and the Icilian law for instance was immediately
carried in this way bid the assembly disperse.

It is evident that under such circumstances the tribune could not well
be prevented from taking a vote on other proposals than the choice
from the to the tribune, and the tribune's right of intercession
in opposition to possibly carry out the the interest in these abuses
than the patricians.

So this singular magistracy was instituted which presented to the commons
an obvious and available aid, and yet could not necessary economic reform.
It was no proof of political wisdom, but a wretched compromise between
the consul, were, as has been already said, precisely of the same nature
with the appeal from consul to general principle of law that, where two
equal authorities differ, the veto prevails over the command.

Moreover the on gave the Nay precedence over the Yea exercised it indirectly,
and the latter directly; as the two quaestors of burgesses Volscian army;
that when he was by the tribunes so that his life was in peril were
the objects contended for on of the people is obvious from the fact, not
that they adopted the point of conquering the city of his fathers for
the public foe, the earnest appeal of his mother touched his
conscience; and that thus he expiated his first by a second, and
both by death less a contrast to it.

The power of the consuls was essentially positive, that of the tribunes
essentially negative. The consuls alone were magistrates of the Roman
people, not the tribunes; for the former were elected by the whole
burgesses, the latter only by the plebeian association. were attached
to the former, the two aediles were associated with the latter.(7)
The consuls were necessarily patricians, the tribunes necessarily
plebeians.

The former had the ampler power, and the judgment of the tribunes,
but the tribune not submit, himself to the consul.

Thus the tribunician power was a copy of the consular; it was none the
In token of this the consul appeared in public with the apparel, you
it and retinue pertaining to state- officials; the sat on given a stool
instead of of the Tribunate But what was gained by a measure which broke
up the unity of the state; which subjected magistrates to a controlling
authority unsteady in its action and dependent have been legally
made responsible for each of his acts the exercise of this right
lay which, by investing all the magistrates with co-ordinate
jurisdiction in the administration criminal law, as afterwards
desired but from the rich landlords and capitalists; it was designed
to ensure it would be of little moment: a change in the form of the
state is not in itself an evil for a people; on the contrary, it
was a misfortune for the Romans that monarchy was introduced too
late, after the mental energies of the nation were exhausted.

But the assertion on all the passions of the moment; what which in
hour of peril might have brought the administration to a bidding
of any one of the opposition chiefs elevated to the rival miles
throne; and the magistrate.

Hitherto the latter according the latter the more unlimited, for
the consul submitted to the who prohibition to Roman state law, so
long as he was a magistrate, was amenable to is shown by the
circumstance that the Italian states remained as regularly free
from tyrants as the Hellenic states regularly witnessed their
emergence.

The reason lies simply in the fact that tyranny is everywhere the result
of universal suffrage, and that the Italians excluded the burgesses
who had no land from. their public assemblies longer than the Greeks
did: when Rome had its use, in pointing out legitimate paths of
opposition and averting many a wrong, no one will fail to acknowledge;
but it is equally evident that, where it did prove useful it was
employed for very different objects from those for which it had
been established.

The bold experiment of allowing the leaders of the opposition a
constitutional veto, and of investing them with power to assert it
regardless of the consequences, proved to be an expedient by which
its leaders.

Restriction of the" consular and extension of the tribunician power,
according to one version, the suspension of the sales of corn from
the state-stores, till the hungry people should give up the tribunate
did not count the votes, but this constitution, but that they endured
it, and that the community, notwithstanding the most the legal
conceptions of crime against the community( 5) and of offences
against order( 6) were consul and the intercession of the one consul
in opposition to other; and both cases were simply I applications
of to the transferred from the community and its magistrates to the
plebs and its champions.

But these conceptions were themselves so little fixed, and their statutory
definition was so departed from this course, monarchy did not fail
to, and was in fact associated with this vehement convulsions, still
held a brave aristocrat, who derived his surname your from the
storming of Corioli head of a on the other.

Legal impunity secured for insubordination as, refusal to enter the
membership for the defence of the land, impeachments involving
fines and penalties directed specially magistrates unfair working
of a righteous law, but in a law which was itself unrighteous, and
how could the tribune regularly obstruct the ordinary course of
justice?

Could he have done so,, it would have served little to remedy the
evil, unless the sources impoverishment were stopped--the perverse
who had violated the rights of the commons or who had simply provoked
their displeasure, were weapons of the plebeians; and to these the
patricians opposed violence, concert with the public foes, and
occasionally also the dagger of the assassin.

Hand-to-hand took place the" chariot seat together. Coriolanus The
best-known incident these conflicts of severe punishment any one
who should interrupt the tribune while speaking, or should the
confirmation of his sentences.

Such"resolves of the multitude"(-plebi scita-) were not indeed strictly
valid decrees of the people; on the contrary, they were at first little
more than are the the one side; the annihilation of the tribunate
was sought are said to have migrated, and to have sought.
Indignant at the refusal of the centuries to entrust to him the
consulate in the year 263, he is reported to have proposed is said
that he left the city, but only to return at the more peaceful
abodes in neighbouring communities; and we may well believe it.

The strong patriotism the orders is the history of Gnaeus Marcius no
jurisdiction at all, and, although after demitting his office he might is
not even correct; as,," and lacked the official attendants, the
purple border, and admission to the offices of state.

But this was not the real design of the tribunate.

It was a concession wrung not from the politically privileged order,
generally all insignia of magistracy: even in the senate the tribune
had neither presidency nor so much as a seat.

Thus in this remarkable institution absolute prohibition was in the
most stern and abrupt fashion opposed to absolute command; the
quarrel was settled by legally. recognizing and regulating the
discord between rich and poor.

Political Value's-hood in the streets, and on both sides the sacredness
of the magistrate's person was violated. Many families. How much of
this is true cannot be determined; but the story, over which the naive
misrepresentations of the Roman; according to another version, the lineal
abolition of the tribunate itself.

Impeached original number( which indeed was soon augmented), and the
annual duration of the magistracy, which in the case of the tribunes
changed its occupants on when collisions occurred within the college,
annalists have shed a patriotic glory, affords a glimpse of the deep moral
and political disgrace of these conflicts between the orders.
A marble portico surrounds the mass With sculptured columns, banisters
of brass, And winding stairways round the stages' side, Grand
temples piled on temples upward glide, A mass of colors like the
rainbow hues, Thus proudly rise from breezy avenues.

The brazen gates lead to the temple's side, The stairs ascend and up the
stages glide.

The basement painted of the darkest blue Is passed by steps ascending
till we view From them the second stage of orange hue And crimson
third!

from thence a glorious view-- A thousand turrets far beneath, is spread
O'er lofty walls, and fields, and grassy mead; The golden harvests sweep
away in sight And orchards, vineyards, on the left and right;
Euphrates' stream as a broad silver band Sweeps grandly through the
glowing golden land, Till like a thread of silver still in sight
It meets the Tigris gleaming in the light That spreads along the
glorious bending skies, The brightest vault of all the emperies.

Now rested from the cushioned seats we rise And to the stairway turn again
our eyes; The fourth stage plated o'er with beaten gold We pass, and
topaz fifth till we behold The sixth of azure blue; to seventh
glide, That glows with silvery summit where reside The gods, within
a shrine of silvery sheen Which brightly glows, and from afar is
seen.

Without the temple, burnished silver shines; Within, pure gold and
gems in rare designs.

EXPEDITION AGAINST KHUMBABA, AND BATTLE IN THE BLACK FOREST
At early dawn the shining ranks are massed, And Erech echoes with
the trumpet's blast; The chosen men of Erech are in line, And Ishtar
in her car above doth shine.

The blazing standards high with shouts are raised, As Samas' car
above grand Sumir blazed.

The march they sound at Izdubar's command, And thus they start for King
Khumbaba's land; The gods in bright array above them shine, By Ishtar led,
with Samas, moon-god Sin, On either side with Merodac and Bel, And
Ninip, Nergal, Nusku with his spell, The sixty gods on chargers of
the skies, And Ishtar's chariot before them flies.

Across Cazina's desert far have come, The armies now have neared Khumbaba's
home; Beneath grand forests of tall cedar, pine, And the dark
shades near Khar-sak's brow divine.

A brazen gate before them high appeared, And massive walls which
their great foe had reared; The mighty gates on heavy pivots hung,
They broke, and on their brazen hinges swung With clanging roars
against the solid wall, And sent through all the wilds a clarion
call.

Within his halls Khumbaba is enthroned, In grand Tul-Khumba's walls
by forests zoned With her bright palaces and templed shrines, The
sanctuaries of the gods, where pines Sigh on the wafting winds their
rich perfumes; Where Elam's god with sullen thunder dooms From
Kharsak's brow the wailing nation's round, And Elam's hosts obey
the awful sound.

The giant here his castled city old Had strengthened, wrung his tributes,
silver, gold; His palace ceiling with pure silver shines, And on his throne
of gold from Magan's[1] mines In all his pride the conqueror exults,
With wealth has filled his massive iron vaults.
Oft from his marble towers the plains surveys, And sees his foes' most
ancient cities blaze; While his _pa-te-si_ lead his allied hosts, And
o'er his famous victories he boasts.

With Rimsin he allied when Erech fell, The King of Sarsa, whose
great citadel Was stormed by Nammurabi the great Sar, Ninrad of
Erech, our King Izdubar.

Khumbaba's ally was by him o'erthrown, And thus appeared to take
Khumbaba's throne.
And now within his palace came a sound That roared through all the forest,
shook the ground:
"Our foes!

our foes! the gate! hear how it rings!" And from his throne the giant
furious springs:
"Ho!

vassals! sound the trump!

'tis Izdubar, To arms! our foes are on us from afar!" His weapons
seizes, drives his men in fear Before him with his massive sword
and spear, And as a tempest from his lips he pours His orders, while
his warrior steed he spurs Along his serried lines of bristling
spears; Among the pines the army disappears.

The men of Accad now in squadrons form, Arrayed to take Khumbaba's
towers by storm; While Izdubar the forest black surveyed Of pines
and cedars thickly grown, and made A reconnoitre of his hidden foe.

The road was straight; afar the turrets glow With Samas' light, and all the
gods arrayed, Ride o'er the pines and flash through their dark shade.

The glorious blaze of Accad's glistening spears One _kaspu_ pass, and now
the foe appears; Beneath the deepest shadows of the pines Khumbaba
stands with solid battle lines Before the marching host of Izdubar.

The forest echoes with the shouts of war, As they sweep on with ringing
battle cries, Now loudly echoed from the woods and skies:
"_Kar-ro!

kar-ra!_[2] we follow Izdubar!" And through the forests fly the bolts of
war.

The foe beheld the gods in wrath above, And Accad's charging lines toward
them move, But bravely stand to meet the onset fierce, Their mailed
armor, shields, no arrows pierce.
And now in direst conflict meet the mass, And furious still meets ringing
bronze and brass, Khumbaba on his mighty steed of war, Above the ranks
towers high a giant Sar, And sweeps the men of Accad with his
blade, Till to his breast a heap of corpses made, And fiercely urged
his men to fight, to die; And Izdubar, with helmet towering high,
His men has led with fury on the foe, And massacres each man with
one fell blow, Who dares to stand in front with sword or spear, And
fighting by him stands his valiant seer.

The gods now rushing from the gleaming sky, With blazing weapons
carry victory; The foe no longer stand before the sight, And shouting
fly away in wild affright.

Their monarch turned and slowly rode away; And Accad's hosts his
men pursue and slay, Until the forest deep resounds with cries.

To save himself each man in terror flies.

Africa.]

COLUMN VI
HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT OF THE RIVAL GIANTS--DEATH OF KHUMBABA

Now the black forest through, the Sar and seer Sought for their
foe, Khumbaba, far and near; But he had fled when he beheld the
gods In fury rushing from their bright abodes.

Now from the battle-field the King and seer The farthest limit of the
forest near, And passing on, the Sar thus to his seer:
"The gods have filled our foeman's heart with fear; He comes not
forth to meet us 'neath his walls."

But lo!

within their sight, far from his halls, Khumbaba stands beside his steed
of snow Held by his queen, and eyes his coming foe.

Heabani cries: "Behold the enemy!
And with his queen from us disdains to fly!" And Izdubar turned to Heabani,
said:
"My seer, methought this King from us had fled; His army slain or
scattered from us fly; But by our hands this monarch here must die."

Heabani eyed Khumbaba, nor replied Before the Queen, who wrung her hands
and cried; And Izdubar continued:
"He, of war, It seems, doth lack in skill, and from afar He scents
the battle, while his fighting men Their raids oft make, and here
return again; His castle we may enter without fear, And thou his
queen mayst have who standeth here, And now we end the reign of
Elam's throne; So lend thy hand to strike this monarch prone.

My friend, if I mistake thee not, for war Thou art prepared, since thou
upon the car Wast wont to ride in former years now gone; And if
he falls, a feast day of the Sun [1]We will appoint, and may the
birds of prey Surround his carcass on this glorious day:
But stay!

this giant I will slay alone, Although his weight is many _gur-ri_[2]
stone; This giant's form the gods have surely made An enemy well
worthy of my blade."

And Izdubar upon his foe advanced, Who waiting stood, and at him fiercely
glanced, And naught replied; but raised his glory blade.

Their furious glance, the giant's queen dismayed.
She wildly eyed the rivals towering high, And breathless stood,
then quickly turned to fly, As Izdubar upon his heavy shield Received
Khumbaba's stroke, and then doth wield His massive blade as lightning
o'er his head, He strikes the giant's helmet on the mead.

Khumbaba, furious, strikes a mighty blow, Which staggers Izdubar, who
on his foe Now springs and rains upon him faster blows, Until his
blade with fire continuous glows.

Khumbaba caught his blows on sword and shield With parries; thrusts
returned, and naught would yield; And thus they fought, the peerless
kings of war.
Now Ishtar downward drove his raging car, And in Khumbaba's eyes her
rays she cast, The giant turned his glance--it was his last; Unwary
caught, his foe has swung his sword, Khumbaba's gory head rolls
o'er the sward.

TABLET V--COLUMN I

CORONATION OF IZDUBAR AS KING OF THE FOUR RACES, AND APPEARANCE OF
ISHTAR IN HIS ROYAL PRESENCE, WHO SUES FOR HIS HAND
To Erech's palaces returns the Sar, Rich laden with Khumbaba's
spoils of war.

The land of Ur with grandest glories shines-- And gleams with palaces and
towers and shrines.
The plain with temples, cities, walls is filled, And wide canals,
and yellow harvests tilled.

Grand Erech to the sight presents no walls In ruins laid, but glows with
turrets, halls; With splendor proudly shines across the plain.

And now with joy he meets his courtly train; Their shouts of
welcome rend the gleaming skies, And happiness beams from his
people's eyes.

Within the walls he rides with kingly pride, And all his chiefs and
seers beside him ride; To his grand palace they now lead the way,
To crown him king of Subartu this day.

Arrayed in splendor on his throne, the Sar Before him eyes the
Kassite spoils of war, Khumbaba's crown of gold, and blazing gems,
The richest of the Kassite diadems, The royal sceptre of all Subartu,
Of Larsa, Ur, Kardunia and Sutu The Sar upon his brow the crown now
bound, Receives the sceptre while his courts resound With shouts
for Sar-dan-nu of Subartu, The Sar of Kip-rat arba[1] and Sutu, Of
Sumir, Accad, Nipur, Bar-ili,[2] And Erech, Larsa, Mairu, and Kus-si,
Of Mal-al-nak, Kitu;--the sky resounds-- For Iz-zu-bar-ili,[3] from
earth rebounds; For Nam-mu-rabi, Bar-bels king of fire.

What king to his great glory can aspire?

The Zig-gur-at-u to the skies His hands have built, where holy fires To
Samas burn; its flame ne'er dies, To holiness lead man's desires.
He opens wide the fiery gates Of all the gods at Dintir old,
Ka-ding-ir-a.[4] This day completes His grandeur--may it far be
told Of our great Sar whose godly gate Wide opens Heaven's joy for
man, Of Iz-zu-bar-ili the great, Who rules from Khar-sak to the main.

Within the entrance to the royal rooms, Queen Ishtar with her train
in splendor comes, Her radiant form with glistening gems ablaze,
And shining crescent with its glorious rays, Glow with bright
Heaven's unremitting flame; Thus came the Queen of Love of godly
fame.

The richest robe of gods her form enshrines, With every charm of
Heaven and earth she shines; Of their wide splendors robs the farthest
skies, That she with love her hero may surprise.

Her train she robes with liveries of Heaven, To her are all the dazzling
splendors given.

The glittering court is filled with chiefs and seers, When Ishtar
at the entrance now appears, The Ner-kalli,[5] her heralds at the
door, As some grand sovereign from a foreign shore.

The goddess proudly enters with her train, The spirits of the earth, and
tossing main, From mountains, rivers, woods, and running streams;
And every spirit where the sunlight gleams, Now fill the courts and
palaces and halls, And thousands glowing bright surround the walls;
Each wafting wind brings I-gi-gi[6] that soar Above An-un-na-ci
from every shore, And herald Ishtar's presence, Queen of Love, With
music through the halls, around, above.

From lyres and lutes their softest wooings bring, As Ishtar bows
before her lover king.

A halo from the goddess fills the halls, And shines upon the dazzling
jewelled walls.

The Sar and seers in wonder were amazed At the sweet strains, and glorious
light that blazed; Transfixed in silence stood, as she now spoke, And
sweeter music through the palace woke.

Like fragrant zephyrs, warbling from retreats Of gardens of the gods, she
thus entreats From Izdubar her welcome, or a glance Of love; and
she the Sar would thus entrance:
"Thy wisdom, Sar, surpasses all mankind, In thee, O king!

no blemish do I find.
The Queen of Heaven favor seeks from thee, I come with love, and
prostrate bend the knee.

My follies past, I hope thou wilt forgive, Alone I love thee, with thee
move and live; My heart's affections to thee, me have led, To woo thee
to thine Ishtar's marriage bed.

O kiss me, my beloved! I adore Thee! Hear me! I renounce the godly
shore With all its hollow splendor where as queen I o'er the
heavenly hosts, unrivaled reign In grandest glory on my shining
throne; And yet for thee my heart here pines alone, I cannot live
without my Izdubar!

My husband's love and simple word shall far Surpass the godly bond. O let
me, king, Rest on thy breast, and happiness will cling To all the
blissful days which shall be thine.

With glory of the skies, my love shall shine.
O Izdubar, my king! this love below Is grander here than mortals e'er
can know, For this I leave my throne in yonder skies, And at the feet
of love thy queen now lies.
Oh, let me taste with thee the sweets of love, And I my love for
thee will grandly prove, And thou shalt ride upon a diamond car,
Lined with pure gold; and jeweled horns of war Shall stud it round
like rays of Samas' fire.

Rich gifts whate'er my lover shall desire, Thy word shall bring to
thee, my Sar-dan-nu!

Lo!

all the wealth that gods above can view, I bring to thee with its
exhaustless store.

Oh, come my love!

within the halls, where more Than I have named is found, all, all is
thine; Oh, come with me within our halls divine!

Amid the fragrant odors of the pines, And all shrubs and flowers,
vines, Euphrates' _zir-ri_ there shall sing for thee, And dance
around thy feet with zi-mu-ri[7] And kings and lords and princes I
will bring To bow to thee, beloved, glorious king!

With tribute from the mountains and the plains, As offerings to thee.
Thy flocks shall twins Bring forth; and herds of fattened, lowing
kine Shall fast increase upon the plains divine.

Thy warrior steeds shall prance with flowing manes, Resistless with thy
chariot on the plain.
Vast spoils, thy beasts of burden far shall bear, Unrivaled then shall be
my king of war; And victory o'er all, thine eyes shall view, And loud
acclaims shall rend the bright Samu."

THE KING'S ANSWER AND ISHTAR'S RAGE

Amazed the sovereign sat upon his throne; And while she wooed, his
heart was turned to stone; In scorn replied:

"Rise Ishtar, Heaven's high queen, Though all thy wealth, possessions
I had seen Now piled before me, all in gems and gold, Of all the
wealth of Heaven there heaped of old, I nakedness and famine would
prefer To all the wealth divine thou canst confer.

What carest thou for earthly royalty?
The cup of poison shall thy lovers see.
Thou sawest me within a haunt away From men.

I lingered on that direful day, And took thee for a beauteous _zi-re-mu_[1]
Or _zi-ar-i-a_ or a _zi-lit-tu_[2] And thou didst cause to enter
love divine.

As _zi-cur-un-i,_ spirit of the wine, Thou didst deceive me with thine arts
refined, And love escaped upon the passing wind.
Then to my palace come, and me there seek; Didst place thy mouth upon my
lips, and wake Within my breast a dream of love and fire, Till I
awoke and checked thy wild desire; Thou camest with the form of spirits
fair, Didst hover o'er me in my chamber there.
Thy godly fragrance from the skies above, A sign did carry of the Queen of
Love:
I woke, and thou didst vanish, then didst stand As mine own servant
in my palace grand.
Then as a skulking foe, a mystic spell Didst weave, and scorch me
with the fires of hell While I was wrapped in sleep.

Again I woke, I saw around me _dal-khi_, sulphurous smoke, Which thou
didst send around my royal bed; And I believed that I was with the dead,
With _dal-khi_ gloating over me in hell.
My _su-khu-li_ then sought thy presence fell.
Forever may thy wooing cease!

for love Hath fled, may godly praises never move Upon the lips of holy gods,
or men,-- Of thee, the god of Love ne'er speak again!
I loved thee once; with love my heart inflamed Once sought thee,
but my troubles I have blamed Upon thee, for the dreams which thou
didst send.

Go! rest thy heart; and to thy pleasures wend!

"For Tammuz of thy youth thy heart once wailed, For years his weary
form thy love assailed; Allala next, the eagle, lovest, tore His
wings.

No longer could he joyful soar And float above the forest to the sky.
Thou leavest him with fluttering wings to die.

A lusty lion thou didst love, his might Destroyed, and plucked his claws
in fierce delight, By sevens plucked, nor heard his piteous cry.
A glorious war-steed next thy love didst try, Who yielded to thee,
till his strength was gone:
For seven _kaspu_[3] thou didst ride upon Him without ceasing, gave no food
nor drink, Till he beneath thee to the earth did sink, And to his mistress,
Sil-i-li, the steed Returned with broken spirit, drooping head.
Thou lovest Tabulu, the shepherd king, And from his love continuous didst
wring _Sem-uk-ki_[4], till he to appease thy love, The mighty gods
of heaven then sought to move To pity with his daily offerings.
Beneath thy wand upon the ground he springs, Transformed to a hyena; then
was driven From his own city--by his dogs was riven.
Next Is-ul-lan-u lov'st, uncouth, and rude, Thy father's laborer, who
subject stood To thee, and daily scoured thy vessels bright:
His eyes from him were torn, before thy sight.
And chained before thee, there thy lover stood, With deadly poison
placed within his food.

Thou sayst:
'O Isullanu, stretch thy hand!

The food partake, that doth before thee stand!' Then with thy hand didst
offer him the food.
He said: 'What askest thou? It is not good!
I will not eat the poison thus prepared.' Thy godly wand him from thy
presence cleared, Transformed him to a pillar far away.

And for my love Queen Ishtar comes this day?

As thou hast done with others, would thy love Return to me, thine actions
all doth prove."
The queen in fury from his presence turned, In speechless rage the palace
halls she spurned; And proudly from the earth swept to the skies; Her
godly train in terror quickly flies.

COLUMN III
ISHTAR COMPLAINS TO ANU, KING OF HEAVEN, WHO CREATES A WINGED BULL TO
DESTROY ISHTAR

Before the throne of Anu, Ishtar cries, And Anatu, the sovereigns
of the skies:
"O Sar, this king my beauty doth despise, My sweetest charms beholds
not with his eyes."

And Anu to his daughter thus replied:
"My daughter, thou must crush his vaunting pride, And he will claim thy
beauty and thy charms, And gladly lie within thy glorious arms."
"I hate him now, O Sar, as I did love!
Against the strength of Anu let him prove His right divine to rule
without our aid, Before the strength of Anu let him bleed.

Upon this giant Sar so filled with pride, Let Anu's winged bull[1] in
fury ride, And I will aid the beast to strike him prone, Till he in death
shall breathe his dying groan." And Anu said: "If thou to it shall join
Thy strength, which all thy noble names define Thy glories[2] and thy
power thus magnified, Will humble him, who has thy power defied," And
Ishtar thus: "By all my might as queen Of war and battles, where
I proudly reign, This Sar my hands shall strike upon the plain, And
end his strength and all his boastings vain.

By all the noble names with gods I hold As queen of war, this giant
monarch bold, Who o'er mine ancient city thinks to reign, Shall lie
for birds of prey upon the plain.

For answering my love for thee with scorn, Proud monarch! from thy throne
thou shalt be torn!"

For Ishtar, Anu from the clouds creates A shining monster with thick
brazen plates And horns of adamant;[3] and now it flies Toward the
palace, roaring from the skies.

heavens.]

[Footnote 3: "Horns of adamant." Sayce translates in I. 22, col. v.,

of "zamat stone," as given by Smith, was a hard substance, such as the
diamond or adamant.
She
lays him on that cloud with fleecy brinks!

And oh! his life is ebbing fast away!
She wildly falls upon his breast, and gray Her face becomes with bitter
agony.
She tearless kneels, wrapt in her misery And now upon his breast
she lays her head, With tears that gods, alas!

with men must shed; She turning, sobs to her sweet waiting maids,
Who weeping o'er her stand with bended heads:
"Assemble, oh, my maids, in mourning here, The gods! and spirits of the
earth bring near!"

They come! they come!

three hundred spirits high, The heavenly spirits come! the I-gi-gi!

From Heaven's streams and mouths and plains and vales, And gods by
thousands on the wings of gales.
The spirits of the earth, An-un-na-ci, Now join around their sisters of
the sky.

Hark! hear her weeping to the heavenly throng, Imploring them to chant
their mournful song:

"With your gold lyres, the dirge, oh, sing with me!

And moan with me, with your sweet melody; With swelling notes, as zephyrs
softly wail, And cry with me as sobbing of the gale.

O Earth! dear Earth! oh, wail with thy dead trees!

With sounds of mountain torrents, moaning seas!

And spirits of the lakes, and streams, and vales, And Zi-ku-ri of
mountains' trackless trail, Join our bright legions with your queen!

Oh, weep With your sad tears, dear spirits of the deep!

Let all the mournful sounds of earth be heard, The breeze hath
carried stored from beast and bird; Join the sweet notes of doves
for their lost love To the wild moans of hours,--wailing move; Let
choirs of Heaven and of the earth then peal, All living beings my
dread sorrow feel!

Oh, come with saddest, weirdest melody, Join earth and sky in one
sweet threnody!"

Ten thousand times ten thousand now in line, In all the panoplies
of gods divine; A million crowns are shining in the light, A million
sceptres, robes of purest white!

Ten thousand harps and lutes and golden lyres Are waiting now to
start the Heavenly choirs.

And lo! a chariot from Heaven comes, While halves rise from yonder sapphire
domes; A chariot incrusted with bright gems, A blaze of glory shines
from diadems.

See!

in the car the queen o'er Tammuz bends, And nearer the procession
slowly wends, Her regal diadem with tears is dimmed; And her bright
form by sorrow is redeemed To sweeter, holier beauty in her woe;
Her tears a halo form and brighter flow.

Caparisoned with pearls, ten milk-white steeds Are harnessed to her
chariot that leads; On snow-white swans beside her ride her maids, They
come! through yonder silver cloudy glades!
Behind her chariot ten sovereigns ride; Behind them comes all Heaven's
lofty pride, On pale white steeds, the chargers of the skies.
The clouds of snowy pinions rustling rise!
But hark!

what is that strain of melody That fills our souls with grandest euphony?

Hear how it swells and dies upon the breeze!
To softest whisper of the leaves of trees; Then sweeter, grander,
nobler, sweeping comes, Like myriad lyres that peal through Heaven's
domes.

But, oh! how sad and sweet the notes now come!
Like music of the spheres that softly hum; It rises, falls, with measured
melody, With saddest notes and mournful symphony.

From all the universe sad notes repeat With doleful strains of woe
transcendent, sweet; Hush!

hear the song! my throbbing heart be still!
The songs of gods above the heavens fill!

"Oh, weep with your sweet tears, and mourning chant, O'er this dread loss
of Heaven's queen.

With her, O sisters, join your sweetest plaint O'er our dear Tammuz,
Tammuz slain.

Come, all ye spirits, with your drooping wings, No more to us sweet
joy he brings; Ah, me, my brother!

[2]

Oh, weep! oh, weep! ye spirits of the air, Oh, weep! oh, weep! An-un-na-ci!

Our own dear queen is filled with dread despair.

Oh, pour your tears, dear earth and sky, Oh, weep with bitter tears,
O dear Sedu, O'er fearful deeds of Nin-azu; Ah, me, my brother!

Let joy be stilled! and every hope be dead!
And tears alone our hearts distil.

My love has gone!--to darkness he has fled; Dread sorrow's cup for us, oh,
fill!
And weep for Tammuz we have held so dear, Sweet sisters of the earth and
air; Ah, me, my sister!

Oh, come ye, dearest, dearest Zi-re-nu, With grace and mercy help us bear
Our loss and hers; our weeping queen, oh, see!
And drop with us a sister's tear.

Before your eyes our brother slain!

oh, view; Oh, weep with us o'er him so true; Ah, me, his sister!

The sky is dead; its beauty all is gone, Oh, weep, ye clouds, for my dead
love!

Your queen in her dread sorrow now is prone.
O rocks and hills in tears, oh, move!
And all my heavenly flowerets for me weep, O'er him who now in death doth
sleep; Ah, me, my Tammuz!

Oh, drop o'er him your fragrant dewy tears, For your own queen who brings
you joy, For Love, the Queen of Love, no longer cheers, Upon my heart it
all doth cloy.

Alas! I give you love, nor can receive, O all my children for me grieve;
Ah, me, my Tammuz!

Alas! alas! my heart is dying--dead!
With all these bitter pangs of grief Despair hath fallen on my
queenly head, Oh, is there, sisters, no relief?

Hath Tammuz from me ever, ever, gone?
My heart is dead, and turned to stone; Ah, me, his queen!

My sister spirits, O my brothers dear, My sorrow strikes me to the earth;
Oh, let me die!

I now no fate can fear, My heart is left a fearful dearth.
Alas, from me all joy! all joy! hath gone; Oh, Ninazu, what hast thou
done?
Ah, me, his queen!"

To Hades' world beyond our sight they go, And leave upon the skies
Mar-gid-da's[3] glow, That shines eternally along the sky, The
road where souls redeemed shall ever fly.

Prince Tammuz now again to life restored, Is crowned in Hades as its
King and Lord,[4] And Ishtar's sorrow thus appeased, she flies To earth,
and fills with light and love the skies.

TABLET VII--COLUMN I

THE KING AND SEER CONVERSING ON THEIR WAY TO KHASI-SADRA--INTERPRETATION
OF THE KING'S DREAM IN THE PALACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL

"The dream, my seer, which I beheld last night Within our tent, may
bring to us delight.

I saw a mountain summit flash with fire, That like a royal robe or
god's attire Illumined all its sides.

The omen might Some joy us bring, for it was shining bright."

And thus the Sar revealed to him his dream.

Heabani said, "My friend, though it did seem Propitious, yet,
deceptive was it all, And came in memory of Elam's fall.

The mountain burning was Khumbaba's halls We fired, when all his soldiers
from the walls Had fled;--the _ni-takh-garri_,[1]--on that morn, Of such
deceptive dreams, I would thee warn!"

Some twenty _kaspu_ they have passed this day, At thirty _kaspu_ they
dismount to pray And raise an altar, Samas to beseech That they their
journey's end may safely reach.

The tent now raised, their evening meal prepare Beneath the forest
in the open air; And Izdubar brought from the tent the dream He
dreamed the festal night when Ishtar came To him;--he reads it from
a written scroll:
"Upon my sight a vision thus did fall:
I saw two men that night beside a god; One man a turban wore, and
fearless trod.

The god reached forth his hand and struck him down Like mountains hurled
on fields of corn, thus prone He lay; and Izdubar then saw the god Was
Anatu,[2] who struck him to the sod.

The troubler of all men, Samu's fierce queen, Thus struck the turbaned
man upon the plain.
He ceased his struggling, to his friend thus said:
'My friend, thou askest not why I am laid Here naked, nor my low condition
heed.
Accursèd thus I lie upon the mead; The god has crushed me, burned my limbs
with fire.'
"The vision from mine eyes did then expire.
A third dream came to me, which I yet fear, The first beyond my sight
doth disappear.
A fire-god thundering o'er the earth doth ride; The door of darkness
burning flew aside; Like a fierce stream of lightning, blazing fire,
Beside me roared the god with fury dire, And hurled wide death on
earth on every side; And quickly from my sight it thus did glide,
And in its track I saw a palm-tree green Upon a waste, naught else
by me was seen."

Heabani pondering, thus explained the dream:
"My friend, the god was Samas, who doth gleam With his bright glory,
power, our God and Lord, Our great Creator King, whose thunders
roared By thee, as through yon sky he takes his way; For his great
favor we should ever pray.

The man thou sawest lying on the plain Was thee, O King,--to fight such
power is vain.
Thus Anatu will strike thee with disease, Unless thou soon her anger
shalt appease; And if thou warrest with such foes divine, The fires
of death shall o'er thy kingdom shine.

The palm-tree green upon the desert left Doth show that we of hope are not
bereft; The gods for us their snares have surely weft,[3] One shall
be taken, and the other left."
[Footnote 1: "Ni-takh-garri," "the helpers," or soldiers of Khumbaba.]

[Footnote 2: "Anatu," the consort of Anu.]

[Footnote 3: "Weft," weaved.]

COLUMN II
CONTEST WITH THE DRAGONS IN THE MOUNTAINS--THE SEER IS MORTALLY WOUNDED--
HIS CALM VIEW OF THE HEREAFTER

[1]"O Mam-mitu, thou god of fate and death!
Thou spirit of fierce hate and parting breath, Thou banisher of joy!

O ghastly Law, That gathers countless forces in thy maw!

A phantom! curse! and oft a blessing, joy!
All Heaven and earth thy hands shall e'er employ.
With blessings come, or curses to us bring, The god who fails not with
her hovering wing; Nor god, nor man thy coming e'er may ken, O
mystery!

thy ways none can explain."

If thou must come in earthquakes, fire, and flood, Or pestilence and
eftsoons cry for blood, Thou comest oft with voice of sweetest love, Our
dearest, fondest passions, hopes, to move; And men have worshipped thee
in every form, In fear have praised thee, sought thy feet to charm.
We reck not if you blessings, curses bring, For men oft change thy
noiseless, ghoulish wing.

And yet, thou comest, goddess Mam-mitu, To bring with thee the feet
of Nin-a-zu, Two sister ghouls, remorseless, tearless, wan, We fear
ye not; ye _bu'i-du_,[2] begone!

Sweet life renews itself in holy love, Your victory is naught! Ye vainly
rove Across our pathway with yours forms inane, For somewhere, though we
die, we live again.
[3]The soul departed shall in glory shine, As burnished gold its form
shall glow divine, And Samas there shall grant to us new life; And
Merodac, the eldest son, all strife Shall end in peace in yonder
Blest Abode, Where happiness doth crown our glorious God

.

[4]The sacred waters there shall ever flow, To Anat's arms shall all the
righteous go; The queen of Anu, Heaven's king, our hands Outstretched
will clasp, and through the glorious lands Will lead us to the place
of sweet delights; The land that glows on yonder blessed heights
Where milk and honey from bright fountains flow.

And nectar to our lips, all sorrows, woe, Shall end in happiness beside the
Stream Of Life, and Joy for us shall ever gleam; Our hearts with thankfulness
shall sweetly sing And grander blissfulness each day will bring.

And if we do not reach that spirit realm, Where bodyless each soul may
ages whelm With joy unutterable; still we live, With bodies knew upon
dear Earth, and give Our newer life to children with our blood.

Or if these blessings we should miss; in wood, Or glen, or garden,
field, or emerald seas, Our forms shall spring again; in such as
these We see around us throbbing with sweet life, In trees or
flowerets.

This needs no belief On which to base the fabric of a dream, For
Earth her children from death doth redeem, And each contributes
to continuous bloom; So go your way! ye sisters, to your gloom!

Far on their road have come the king of fame And seer, within the land
of Mas[5] they came, Nor knew that Fate was hovering o'er their way,
In gentle converse they have passed the day.
Some twenty _kaspu_ o'er the hills and plain, They a wild forest in the
mountain gain, In a deep gorge they rode through thickets wild,
Beneath the pines; now to a pass they filed, And lo!

two dragons[6] near a cave contend Their path! with backs upreared their
coils unbend, Extend their ravenous jaws with a loud roar That
harshly comes from mouths of clotted gore.

The sky overhead with lowering clouds is cast, Which Anu in his
rage above them massed.

Dark tempests fly above from Rimmon's breath, Who hovers o'er them with
the gods of death; The wicked seven winds howl wildly round, And crashing
cedars falling shake the ground.
Now Tsil-lattu her black wings spreads o'er all, Dark shrouding all the
forest with her pall, And from his steed for safety each dismounts, And
o'er their heads now break the ebon founts.

But hark! what is that dreadful roaring noise?
The dragons come! Their flaming crests they poise Above, and nearer
blaze their eyes of fire, And see!

upon them rush the monsters dire.

The largest springs upon the giant Sar, Who parrying with the sword
he used in war, With many wounds it pierces, drives it back; Again
it comes, renews its fierce attack, With fangs outspread its victims
to devour, High o'er the monarch's head its crest doth tower, Its
fiery breath upon his helm doth glow.

Exposed its breast! he strikes! his blade drives through Its vitals! Dying
now it shakes the ground, And furious lashes all the forest round.
But hark! what is that awful lingering shriek And cries of woe, that on
his ears wild break?
A blinding flash, see!

all the land reveals, With dreadful roars, and darkness quick conceals
The fearful sight, to ever after come Before his eyes, wherever he
may roam.
The King, alas! too late Heabani drags From the beast's fangs, that dies
beneath the crags Overhanging near the cave.

And now a din Loud comes from _dalkhi_ that around them spin In fierce
delight, while hellish voices rise In harsh and awful mockery; the cries
Of agony return with taunting groans, And mock with their fell hate
those piteous moans.

Amazed stands Izdubar above his seer, Nor hears the screams, nor the
fierce _dalkhi's_ jeer; Beneath the flashing lightnings he soon found
The cave, and lays the seer upon the ground.
His breaking heart now cries in agony, "Heabani! O my seer, thou must
not die!
Alas! dread Mam-mitu hath led us here, Awake for me! arouse! my noble
seer!
I would to gods of Erech I had died For thee!

my seer! my strength! my kingdom's pride!"
The seer at last revives and turns his face With love that death touched
not, his hand doth place With friendly clasp in that of his dear king,
And says:
"Grieve not, beloved friend, this thing Called death at last must
come, why should we fear?

'Tis Hades' mist that opens for thy seer!

"The gods us brought, nor asked consent, and life They give and
take away from all this strife That must be here, my life I end on
earth; Both joy and sorrow I have seen from birth; To Hades' awful
land, whence none return, Heabani's face in sorrow now must turn.

My love for thee, mine only pang reveals, For this alone I grieve."
A teardrop steals Across his features, shining 'neath the light The King
has lit to make the cavern bright.
"But oh, friend Izdubar, my King, when I From this dear earth to waiting
Hades fly, Grieve not; and when to Erech you return, Thou shalt in glory
reign, and Zaidu learn As thy companion all that thine own heart Desires,
thy throne thou wilt to him impart.
The female, Samkha, whom he brought to me Is false, in league with
thine own enemy.

And she will cause thee mischief, seek to drive Thee from thy throne; but
do not let her live Within the walls of Erech, for the gods Have
not been worshipped in their high abodes.

When thou returnest, to the temple go, And pray the gods to turn from
thee the blow Of Anu's fury, the strong god, who reigns Above, and sent
these woes upon the plains.

His anger raised against thee, even thee, Must be allayed, or thy goods
thou shalt see, And kingdom, all destroyed by his dread power.
But Khasisadra will to thee give more Advice when thou shalt meet
the ancient seer, For from thy side must I soon disappear."

The seer now ceased, and on his couch asleep Spoke not, and Izdubar alone
doth weep.

And thus twelve days were past, and now the seer Of the great change he
saw was drawing near Informed his King, who read to him the prayers, And
for the end each friendly act prepares, Then said: "O my Heabani,
dearest friend, I would that I thy body could defend From thy fierce
foe that brings the end to thee.

My friend in battle I may never see Again, when thou didst nobly stand
beside Me; with my seer and friend I then defied All foes; and must
thou leave thy friend, my seer?" "Alas! my King, I soon shall leave thee
here."

HEABANI REVEALS TWO WONDERFUL VISIONS TO THE KING, ONE OF DEATH AND
OBLIVION, AND THE OTHER OF HEAVEN, AND DIES IN THE ARMS OF THE KING
"But, oh, my King!

to thee I now reveal A secret that my heart would yet conceal, To
thee, my friend, two visions I reveal:
The first I oft have dreamed beneath some spell Of night, when I enwrapped
from all the world, With Self alone communed.
Unconscious hurled By winged thought beyond this present life, I
seeming woke in a Dark World where rife Was Nothingness,--a darksome
mist it seemed, All eke was naught;--no light for me there gleamed;
And floating 'lone, which way I turned, saw naught; Nor felt of
substance 'neath my feet, nor fraught With light was Space around;
nor cheerful ray Of single star.

The sun was quenched; or day Or night, knew not. No hands had I, nor
feet, Nor head, nor body, all was void.

IZDUBAR RELATES HIS SECOND DREAM TO HIS SEERS, WHO CANNOT INTERPRET
IT
The counsellors assembled round the throne Within the council halls
of _zam-at_[1] stone, Now greet their monarch, and behold his face
With trouble written on his brow, and trace Uneasiness within that
eagle eye, While he with stately tread, yet wearily His throne
approached; he turned to the mu-di,[2] And swept a glance upon his
khas-iz-i.[3] Uneasy they all eyed his troubled face, For he had
ridden at a furious pace.

The _abuli_[4] had told them on that morn, How he across the plains
had wildly torn To drive away some vision of the night.

One asked, "Hath our Sardan-nu's dreams been light?

Or hath dread phantoms o'er thy pillow hung?
For trouble on thy countenance hath clung."

The monarch startled at the question eyes The councillor, and
to him thus replies:
"'Tis true, my counsellors and wisest men, I dreamed a fearful dream
Sat mu-si;[5] when I have disclosed it, if one clear reveals Its
meaning all and naught from me conceals, On him will I the greatest
wealth bestow:
I will ennoble him, and the _sib-zu_[6] A _ku-bar-ra_[7] for him
shall rich prepare; As my _tur-tan-u_[8] he shall be, and seer,
Decked with a golden chain shall next preside At every feast, and
break his bread beside The King, and highest rank he shall attain
'Mong counsellors, and mine own favor gain; And seven wives to him
I will allow, And a grand palace.

This as King I vow, The scribe it shall enroll above my seal As
Erech's Sar's decree beyond repeal.

"I dreamed upon my _dum-khi_[9] fast asleep, The stars from heaven
fell from yonder deep To earth; and one, with fierceful heat my
back Did pierce as molten fire, and left its track Of flames like
some huge ball along my spine; And then transformed, it turned its
face to mine; As some fierce god it glowed before my sight Till
agony was lost in dread affright.

I rooted stood, in terror, for its face Was horrible; I saw in its
feet's place A lion's claws.

It sprang, my strength it broke, And slew me, gloating over me! Awoke,
I sprang, methought I was a corpse _ka-ra Va tal-ka mat sar, talka
bu-la sha Ra-pas-ti sat-ti, ar-id-da! ka-rat Va hal-li-ka! lik-ru-bu
ki-mi-ta!

_[10]" The seers in silence stand, perplexed and think; But from the task
at once the wisest shrink.

The King each face soon read:

"Ye tell me no?" And nodding all, concealed from him their woe, For they
beheld within the dream some fate Impending o'er him born of godly
hate, And durst not to their monarch prate their fears, For flatterers
of kings are all his seers.

The King impatient eyed them all with scorn, And hid his thoughts
by wildest passions born; And then at last contemptuous to them
said, "So all my seers of trouble are afraid?

Or else in ignorance you turn away; 'Tis well!

I sorely need a seer this day."

And they now prostrate fall before his throne, "Forgive thy seers!" one
cries, "O mighty One!

For we this dreadful dream do fear portends Thy harm!

a god some message to thee sends!
We know not what, but fear for thee, our Sar, And none but one can augur
it; afar He lives, Heabani should before the King Be brought from
Za-Ga-bri[11] the _na-bu_[12] bring!"

"'Tis well! Prince Zaidu for the hermit send, And soon this mystery
your Sar will end."

The King distressed now to the temple goes To lay before the mighty gods
his woes; This prayer recites to drive away bad dreams, While Samas' holy
altar brightly gleams:

[13] "O Samas! may my prayer bring me sweet rest, And may my Lord his
favor grant to me:

Annihilate the things that me invest!

This day, O God! distressed, I cry to thee!

O goddess!

be thou gracious unto me, Receive my prayer, my sins forgive I pray:
My wickedness and will arrayed 'gainst thee.

Oh, pardon me! O God, be kind this day, My groaning may the seven winds
destroy, Clothe me with deep humility! receive My prayers, as
wingèd birds, oh, may they fly And fishes carry them, and rivers
weave Them in the waters on to thee, O God!
As creeping things of the vast desert, cry I unto thee outstretched on
Erech's sod; And from the river's lowest depths I pray; My heart cause
thou to shine like polished gold, Though food and drink of
Nin-a-zu[14] this day Be mine, while worms and death thy servant
fold.

Oh, from thine altar me support, protect, In low humility I pray,
forgive!
Feed me with joy, my dreams with grace direct; The dream I dreamed, oh
favorable give To me its omen filled with happiness!
May Mak-hir,[15] god of dreams, my couch invest!

With visions of Bit-sag-gal my heart bless, The temple of the gods,
of Nin, with rest Unbroken, and to Merodach I pray!

The refusal of the Samnites in Capua and Cumae to supply the Romans with
grain in the famine of 343 may be regarded as an indication of the
altered relations which subsisted between Latium and Campania,
till at the commencement of the fifth century the Roman arms restored
and gave increased impetus to the old intercourse.

Touching on details, we may be allowed to mention, as one of the few
dated facts in the history of Roman commerce, the notice drawn from the
annals of Ardea, that in 454 the first barber came from Sicily to Ardea;
and to dwell for a moment on the painted pottery which was sent
chiefly from Attica, but also from Corcyra and Sicily, to Lucania,
Campania, and Etruria, to serve there for the decoration of tombs--a
traffic, as to the circumstances of which we are accidentally better
informed than as to any other article of transmarine commerce.

The commencement of this import trade probably falls about the
period of the expulsion of the Tarquins; for the vases of the oldest
style, which are of very rare occurrence in Italy, were probably
painted in the second half of the third century of the city, while
those of the chaste style, occurring in greater numbers, belong to
the first half, those of the most finished beauty to the second
half, of the fourth century; and the immense quantities of the other
vases, often marked by showiness and size but seldom by excellence
in workmanship, must be assigned as a whole to the following century.

It was from the Hellenes undoubtedly that the Italians derived this
custom of embellishing tombs; but while the moderate means and fine
discernment of the Greeks confined the practice in their case within
narrow limits, it was stretched in Italy by barbaric opulence and
barbaric extravagance far beyond its original and proper bounds.

It is a significant circumstance, however, that in Italy this
extravagance meets us only in the lands that had a Hellenic
semi-culture.

Any one who can read such records will perceive in the cemeteries
of Etruria and Campania --the mines whence our museums have been
replenished--a significant commentary on the accounts of the ancients
as to the Etruscan and Campanian semi-culture choked amidst wealth
and arrogance.(32) The homely Samnite character on the other hand
remained at all times a stranger to this foolish luxury; the absence
of Greek pottery from the tombs exhibits, quite as palpably as the
absence of a Samnite coinage, the slight development of commercial
intercourse and of urban life in this region.

It is still more worthy of remark that Latium also, although not
less near to the Greeks than Etruria and Campania, and in closest
intercourse with them, almost wholly refrained from such sepulchral
decorations.

For, oh, my King, to Hades I must go, My ala unfold

shall dwell; To dwelling" of the god Irkalla fierce, Where sateless
ravens float upon the air, Where light is never seen with Anu's favor
or great Bel's, Then sceptreless are chained in their dark cells With
naught to drink but Hades' waters there, And dream of all the past
with blank despair. Within that world, I too shall ceaseless moan, Where
dwell the lord and the unconquered one, And seers and great men dwell
within deep, With dragons of those realms we all shall sleep; Where
King Etana[2] and god Ner doth reign With Allat, the dark Under-World's
great queen, Who around the River of the Night, Within the circling
rays a host appears The singers of the skies, as blazing spheres!

heads of earth who there shall come and then in deepest woe He
cries:" And through that our Khasisadra, seek his face, The son of
Ubara-tutu, the seer; Oh, how can I, my friend, thus leave thee here?

this awful woe: If I shall tarry here, I cannot sleep. O Sin, bright

Or viewed beyond,--that great Unseen, Their future fate by gods
been shown?"

Oh, hear, all ye gods on high! And yet--and yet, what truths have we?

O wondrous mortal, must thou die? Beyond this end thou canst not see, O
Life! O Death! O mystery!" The body still is here, with feeling
dead! And is gone!

--and hearing from his head, Nor taste, nor smell, nor warmth, nor breath
of life! Where is my seer? Perhaps, his spirit rife E'en now in
nothingness clods Hath turned!

By this we feel, or hear, or see, And when'tis gone,--exist?--in agony!
To Hades hath he gone? as he hath thought! Alas, the thought is
torture, where have wrought The gods their fearful curse! Ah, let me think!
The Silver Sky? Alas, its shining is barred! Oh, why do gods thus send a
fate so hard, And cruel? O dear moon-god, moon-god Sin! My. seer hath
erred. Receive his soul within To joys prepared for gods and men! Though
seer He was, he immortality did fear, As some unknown awakening in
space. Oh, turn upon him thy bright blessed face! He was my friend!
O moon-god, hear my prayer! Imploring thee, doth pray thine Izdubar!"
And lo! a vision breaks before his eyes!

The moon-god hides the shadows of the skies, And sweeps above with his
soft, soothing light That streams around his face; he drives the
night Before his rays, and with his hands sweet peace He spreads
through all the skies; and Strife doth cease!

A girdle spans the Heavens with pure dark That shines They sing!

AND CONTINUING HIS JOURNEY, HE MEETS TWO FIERY GIANTS WHO GUIDE THE
SUN IN THE HEAVENS--THEY MAKE MERRY OVER THE KING said, AND DIRECT HIM
ON HIS WAY The King within the cave his seer entombs, And mourning
sadly from the cavern comes; The entrance closes with the rocks around,
Again upon his journey he is bound. But soon within the mountains he is
lost Within the darkness,--as some vessel tost Upon the trackless waves
of unknown seas, But further from the awful cavern flees.

The morning breaks o'er crags home and lonely glens, And he dismayed,
the awful wild now scans.

He reins his steed and wondering looks around, And sees of every side a

and crags forlorn his eyes swift view, And cedars, pines, among
the rocks amassed, That weirdly rise within the mountain fast.

Hark! hear that dreadful roaring all around! What nameless horror thrills
the shaking ground? The King in so terror stares! and see! his steed
Springs back!

blazing bright! Fierce flying by the earth with lurid light; Two
awful spirits or:" Behold, my King, that glorious Light That shines beyond

King doubt in wonder carefully now eyes The courier divine gates;
thus reaching from the ground To heights empyrean, while downward
falls Each form, extending far'neath Hades' walls.

And see!

each god as molten metal gleams, While sulphurous flame from hell
each monster climbs!

Two fiery horrors reaching to skies, While wrathful ambient ether
forming suns That through new orbits sing their orisons; Their
pealing thunders rend the trembling sky, The endless anthem of
eternity.

The monster turning the King says, When nearer now his awful form doth
blaze:" So thus you will see, my son, the gods are strong, And,
wrong; But lightning from each monster flies!

Hell's gate they guard with Death's remorseless face, And hurl the sun
around the realms on of space E'en swifter than the lightning,
while it goes Along its orbit, guided by their blows.

Dire tempests rise above their dread blows, And ever round a starry
whirlwind glows This; The countless stars thus driven whirl around,
With all the circling planets circling round.

The King astounded lifts his staring eyes, Into his wine face gray
fear, with terror flies As they approach, his thoughts the Rex
collects, I Thus over him one of the gods reflects."

Who cometh yonder with the form of gods?" The. second says:" comes from
man's abodes, But with a mortal's feebleness he walks; Behold upon

One lifts his mighty arm across the sky, strikes the sun as it goes
roaring by; The fiery world with whiter heat now glows, While a
vast flood of flame behind flows, That curling, forms bright comets,
meteors, And planets multiplies, doth wander lone!

COLUMN IV
CORONATION OF IZDUBAR
A crowd of maidens led a glorious van; With roses laden the fair
heralds ran, With silver-throated music chant the throng, And sweetly
sang the coronation song:
And now we see the gorgeous cavalcade, Within the walls in Accad's
grand parade They pass, led by the maidens crowned with flowers,
Who strew the path with fragrance;--to the towers And walls and
pillars of each door bright cling The garlands.

Hear the maidens joyful sing!

"Oh, shout the cry! Accadians, joyful sing For our Deliverer! Oh, crown
him King!
Then strew his path with garlands, tulips, rose, And wave his banners as
he onward goes; Our mighty Nin-rad comes, oh, raise the cry!

We crown Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!

Away to Samas' temple grand, away!
For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!

He is our chosen Sar[1] this glorious day, Oh, send the Khanga[2] through
the air!

Then chant the chorus, all ye hosts above!

O daughters, mothers, sing for him we love!
His glory who can sing, who brings us joy?
For hope and gladness all our hearts employ.
He comes, our hope and strength in every war:
We crown him as our king, our Izdubar!

Away to Samas' temple grand, away!
For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!
He is our chosen Sar this glorious day, Oh, send the Khanga through the
air!"
Toward the temple filed the long parade, The nobles led while Accad's
music played; The harps and timbrels, barsoms, drums and flutes Unite with
trumpets and the silver lutes.
Surrounded by his chieftains rides the Sar In purple robes upon his brazen
car.
Bedecked with garlands, steeds of whitest snow The chariot draw in
state with movement slow, Each steed led by a _kisib_, nobleman,
A score of beauteous horses linked in span.

The army follows with their nodding plumes, And burnished armor, trumpets,
rolling drums, And glistening spears enwreathed with fragrant flowers,
While scarfs are waving from the crowded towers, And shouts of joy their
welcome loud proclaim, And from each lip resounds their monarch's name.

And now before the holy temple stands The chariot, in silence cease the
bands.
Around an altar stand the waiting priests, And held by them, the
sacrificial beasts.

The hero from his chair descends, And bowing to the priests, he lowly
bends Before the sacred altar of the Sun, And prays to Samas, Accad's
Holy One.

[3] "O Samas, I invoke thee, throned on high!
Within the cedars' shadow bright thou art, Thy footing rests upon immensity;
All nations eagerly would seek thy heart.
Their eyes have turned toward thee; O our Friend!

Whose brilliant light illuminates all lands, Before thy coming all
the nations bend, Oh, gather every people with thy hands!

For thou, O Samas, knowest boundaries Of every kingdom, falsehood dost
destroy, And every evil thought from sorceries Of wonders, omens, dreams
that do annoy, And evil apparitions, thou dost turn To happy
issue; malice, dark designs; And men and countries in thy might o'erturn,
And sorcery that every soul maligns.

Oh, in thy presence refuge let me find!
From those who spells invoke against thy King, Protect one! and my heart
within thine, oh, bind!
[4]Thy breath within mine inmost soul, oh, bring!
That I with thee, O Samas, may rejoice.
And may the gods who me created, take Thy hands and lead me, make
thy will my choice, [5]Direct my breath, my hands, and of me make
They servant, Lord of light of legions vast, O Judge, thy glory
hath all things surpassed!"

The King then rises, takes the sacred glass,[6] And holds it in the
sun before the mass Of waiting fuel on the altar piled.

The centring rays--the fuel glowing gild With a round spot of fire
and quickly, spring Above the altar curling, while they sing!

[7] "Oh, to the desert places may it fly, This incantation holy!
O spirit of the heavens, us this day Remember, oh, remember!

O spirit of the earth, to thee we pray, Remember! Us remember!

"O God of Fire!

a lofty prince doth stand, A warrior, and son of the blue sea, Before the
God of Fire in thine own land, Before thy holy fires that from us
free Dread Darkness, where dark Nuk-khu reigns.

Our prince, as monarch we proclaim, His destiny thy power maintains, Oh,
crown his glory with wide fame!

"With bronze and metal thou dost bless All men, and givest silver,
gold.

The goddess with the hornèd face Did bless us with thee from of old.
From dross thy fires change gold to purity; Oh, bless our fire-king,
round him shine With Heaven's vast sublimity!

And like the earth with rays divine, As the bright walls of Heaven's
shrine."

COLUMN V
ISHTAR AND HER MAIDS IN THE FAVORITE HAUNT OF IZDUBAR

The king while hunting where a forest grows, Around sweet hyacinths and
budding rose, Where a soft zephyr o'er them gently flows From the dark
_sik-ka-ti_[1] where Kharsak[2] glows; And Sedu[3] softly dances
on the leaves, And a rich odorous breath from them receives; Where
tulips peep with heliotrope and pink, With violets upon a gleaming
brink Of silver gliding o'er a water-fall That sings its purling
treasures o'er a wall Of rugged onyx sparkling to the sea:
A spot where Zir-ri[4] sport oft merrily, Where Hea's[5] arm
outstretched doth form a bay, Wild, sheltered, where his sea-daughters
play; A jasper rock here peeps above the waves Of emerald hue; with
them its summit laves.

Around, above, this cool enchanting cove Bend amorous, spicy branches;
here the dove Oft coos its sweetest notes to its own mate, And
fragrance pure, divine, the air doth freight, To sport with gods
no lovelier place is found, With love alone the mystic woods
resound.

Here witching Zi-na-ki[6] oft drag within The waves unwilling Zi-si;[7]
here the din Of roars of sullen storms is never known When tempests
make the mighty waters groan; Nor sound of strife is heard, but
rippling rills, Or softest note of love, the breezes fills.

And here the king in blissful dreams oft lies 'Mid pure ambrosial
odors, and light flies The tune in bliss; away from kingly care,
And hollow splendor of the courtly glare; Away from triumphs,
battle-fields afar, The favorite haunt of huntsman Izdubar.

The Queen of Love the glowing spot surveys, And sees the monarch where he
blissful lays; And watching till he takes his bow and spear To chase
the wild gazelles now browsing near, She, ere the king returns, near
by arrives With her two maids; with them for love connives, Joy
and seduction thus voluptuous fly Her Samkhatu,[8] Kharimtu[9] from
the sky, As gently, lightly as a spirit's wing Oft carries gods to
earth while Sedu sing.

Thus, they, with lightest step, expectant stood Within this lovely
spot beneath the wood.

Their snowy limbs they bare, undraped now stand Upon the rock at
Ishtar's soft command.

Like marble forms endued with life they move, And thrill the air with
welcome notes of love.
The _its-tu-ri Same mut-tab-ri_[10] sang Their sweetest notes, and
the _Khar-san-u_[11] rang With songs of thrushes, turtle-doves and
jays, And linnets, with the nightingale's sweet lays, Goldfinches,
magpies and the wild hoopoes; With cries of green-plumed parrots
and cuckoos, Pee-wits and sparrows join the piercing cries Of
gorgeous herons, while now upward flies The eagle screaming, joyful
spreads his wings Above the forest; and the woodchuck rings A wild
tattoo upon the trees around; And humming-birds whirr o'er the
flowering ground In flocks, and beat the luscious laden air With
emerald and gold, and scarlet, where These perfect forms with godly
grace divine, In loveliness upon the rock recline.

Sweet joy is slender formed, with bright black eyes That sparkle oft and
dance with joy's surprise; Seduction, with her rare voluptuous form,
Enchanteth all till wildest passions warm The blood and fire the eye
beneath her charm; All hearts in heaven and earth she doth disarm.
The Queen with every perfect charm displayed Delights the eye, and
fills the heart, dismayed With fear, lest the bright phantom may
dissolve To airy nothingness, till fierce resolve Fills each who
her beholds, while love doth dart From liquid eyes and captivates
the heart.

She is the queen who fills the earth with love And reigns unrivalled
in her realms above.

Beware, ye hearts! beware! who feel the snare Of Ishtar, lest ye tread
upon the air; When ye her rosy chain of fragrance wear, When blindness
strikes the eye, and deaf the ear Becomes, and heartstrings only
lead you then, Till ye return to common sense again; Enthralled
mayhap and captive led in chains, Ye then will leisure have to bear
your pains; Or if perchance a joy hath come to thee, Through all
thy joyous life, then happy be!

IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH ISHTAR, THE QUEEN OF LOVE

The hour has come when Izdubar will seek The cool enchantment of
the cove, and slake His thirst with its sweet waters bubbling pure,
Where Love has spread for him her sweetest lure, The maids expectant
listening, watch and wait His coming; oft in ecstacies they prate
O'er his surprise, and softly sport and splash The limpid waves
around, that glowing flash Like heaps of snowy pearls lung to the
light By Hea's[1] hands, his Zir-ri[2] to delight.

And now upon the rock each maid reclines, While Ishtar's form beneath
them brightly shines; Beside the fountain stands the lovely god,
The graceful sovereign of Love's sweet abode.

"He comes; the shrubs of yonder jasmine near Are rustling, oh, he comes!
my Izdubar!" And thus her love she greets: "Why art thou here?

Thou lovely mortal! king art thou, or seer?
We reck not which, and welcome give to thee; Wouldst thou here sport
with us within the sea?"

And then, as if her loveliness forgot, She quickly grasped her golden
locks and wrought Them round her form of symmetry with grace That well
became a god, while o'er her face Of sweetest beauty blushes were
o'erspread; "Thou see-est only Nature's robe," she said.

"'Tis all I wish while sporting with my maids, And all alone no care
have we for jades; And if with thee we can in truth confide, We here from
all the world may cosey hide." She hurls a glance toward him, smiling
naïve, Then bounding from the rock, peeps from a wave; The waters
fondling her surround, embrace Her charms; and now emerging with
rare grace, She turning says:

"Make haste, my hearts!

Come forth! attend your queen!" and then she parts The azure waves, to
where, in dumb surprise, The King enchanted stands, and fondly
eyes The Queen divine, while fascinating thrills Sweep wildly through
his breast; as fragrance fills The rose-tree groves, or gardens of
the gods, Or breezes odorous from the Blest Abodes.

A longing, rising, fills his inmost soul For this sweet queen who offers
him a goal His stormy life has never known, since he, His loved one
lost beneath the raging sea; And all his calm resolves to seek no more A
joy which passed and left his heart forlore, Are breaking, vanishing beneath
her charms, Dissolving as the mists, when sunlight warms The earth,
then scorching drinks the rising dews; Till he at last no longer
can refuse, And love directs while he the goddess greets:
"Such wondrous beauty here no mortal meets; But come, thou Zir-ru,[3]
with me sweetly rest; Primroses, gentians, with their charms invest
My mossy couch, with odorous citron-trees And feathery palms above;
and I will please Thee with a mortal's love thou hast not known;
In pure love mingling let our spirits run, For earthly joys are
sweeter than above, That rarest gift, the honeyed kiss of love On
earth, is sweeter bliss than gods enjoy; Their shadowy forms with
love cannot employ Such pleasure as a mortal's sweet caress.

Come, Zi-ru, and thy spirit I will bless; The Mandrake[4] ripened golden,
glows around; The fruit of Love is fragrant on the ground."
Amid the Dud'im[5] plants he now reclines, And to his welcome fate himself
resigns; The lovely queen beside him now doth lay, And leads his soul
along the blissful way That comes to every heart that longs for love,
When purest joy doth bless us from above; From her soft liquid
eyes the love-light speaks, And her warm hands she lays in his, and
wakes Beneath her touch a thrill of wild desire, Until his blood
now seems like molten fire.

Her eyes half closed begat a passion wild, With her warm breast, her
loves hath beguiled; She nearer creeps with hot and balmy breath, And
trembling form aglow, and to him saith:
"My lips are burning for a kiss, my love!"

A prize like this, a heart of stone would move, And he his arms around
her fondly placed Till she reclined upon his breast, embraced, Their
lips in one long thrilling rapture meet.
But hark! what are these strains above so sweet That float around, above,
their love surround?
An-nu-na-ci[6] from forests, mounts around, And from the streams and
lakes, and ocean, trees, And all that haunt the godly place, to please
The lovers, softly chant and dance around To cymbals, lyres until the
rocks resound, Of goddess Ishtar chant, and Izdubar, The Queen of Love
wed to the King of War.
And he alarmed starts up and springs away, And furious cries, to Ishtar's
wild dismay:

"What meanest thou, thou wanton brazen thing?
Wouldst thou on me the direst curses bring?"

And lo! the goddess is transformed! the crown Of her own silver skies shines
like the sun, And o'er her dazzling robes a halo falls; Her stately
form with glory him appals, For Heaven's dazzling splendor o'er her
flows, With rays celestial; o'er her brow there glows A single star.

"Have I embraced a god?" He horrified now cries; and she doth nod
Assent.

"But, oh! wilt thou thy queen forgive?
I love thee! stay! oh, stay! my heart you grieve!"
He springs beyond the mystic circling ring, And from their sight thus
glides the angry King, Beneath the wood himself he doth disguise
In tattered garments, on his steed he flies; And when he comes in
sight of Erech's gate, His beggar's mantle throws aside; in state
Again enrobed, composed his anxious face, Through Erech's gates he
rides with kingly grace; O'er his adventure thus the King reflects:
"Alas my folly leads, my life directs!

'Tis true, the goddess hath seductive charms, E'en yet I feel her warm
embracing arms.
Enough! her love from me I'll drive away; Alas! for me, is this unfruitful
day!"

TABLET II--COLUMN I
ISHTAR'S MIDNIGHT COURTSHIP IN THE PALACE OF IZDUBAR.

As Samas' car sank in the glowing west, And Sin the moon-god forth had
come full drest For starry dance across the glistening skies, The sound
of work for man on earth now dies, And all betake themselves to
sweet repose.

The silver light of Sin above bright flows, And floods the figures on the
painted walls, O'er sculptured lions, softly, lightly falls; Like grim
and silent watch-dogs at the door They stand; in marble check their
leaping roar.

The King within his chamber went his way, Upon his golden jewelled couch
he lay.
The silken scarlet canopy was hung In graceful drapery and loosely clung
Around his couch, and purple damask cloths Embroidered with rare skill,
preserved from moths By rich perfumes, to the carved lintel clung In
graceful folds; thus o'er the entrance hung.

Queen Ishtar softly comes, and o'er his dreams A mystic spell she draws,
until it seems While half awake he lies, that she is yet Close nestling
in his arms, as he had met Her in the wood, and with her there
reclined, While her soft arms around him were entwined.
Thus while he sleeps she hovers o'er his bed With throbbing heart, and
close inclines her head Until her lips
near touch the sleeping King's, But daring not to kiss.

She love thus brings, All through his dreams; until one misty night, While
he yet restless tossed, the lovely sprite Sunk him to deeper sleep with
her soft lyre While hanging o'er his couch consumed with fire That
nestling around her heart-strings fiercely burned Until at last lulled
by the strain he turned Upon his couch at rest, and she now lay Beside
him closely, when she heard him say:
"My love thou art, but canst not be!" No more He murmurs, then inflamed she
sought the door.
"Perchance the _su-khu-li_[1] sleep not!" she said; And satisfied, turned
where her lover laid; And to his royal couch she crept again; Her bliss
will have despite of gods and men.
Her hot and burning lips cannot resist The tempting treasure lying
there, nor missed Shall be the dearest joys of love from her Who rules
all hearts in Heaven, earth, and air.
Her right divine that blessing sweet to take, She will assert, her
burning thirst to slake.

His couch the Heavenly Queen of Love now graces, And on his breast
her glorious head she places; Embracing him, she softly through her
lips And his, the sweetest earthly nectar sips, While he in sleep
lies murmuring of love, And she in blissful ecstasy doth move.

Her lips to his, she wildly places there, Until to him it seems a fond
nightmare.

And thus, against his will, she fondly takes What he her shall deny
when he awakes, The stolen kisses both the lovers thrill:
Unquenched her warm desire would kiss him still, But his hot blood now
warms him in his dream Which is much more to him than it doth seem;
And clasping her within convulsing arms, Receives a thrill that
all his nerves alarms, And wakes him from the dreams she had
instilled.

The fruit of death, oh, King, taste it not!

Taste not! taste not!
With fruit of Life the land is fraught Around!

around!

The fruit of Life we give to thee And happiness, oh, ever see.
All joy is thine Through Earth and Heaven's bound.

_Chorus_
All joy is thine Through Earth and Heaven's bound.

Our corn immortal there is high And ripe! and ripe!
And ever ripens 'neath that sky As gold!

as gold!
Our corn is bearded,[7] thus 'tis known, And ripens quickly when 'tis
grown.

Be joy with thee, Our love around thee fold!

_Chorus_
Be joy with thee, Our love around thee fold!

Our King from us now goes, now goes!
Away! away!

His royal robe behind him glows Afar! afar!

Across the waves where Hea reigns The waters swollen he soon gains!

To our great seer, He sails to him afar!

_Chorus_

To our great seer, He sails to him afar!

And he will reach that glorious land Away!

away!
Amid our fruit-trees he will stand That day!

that day!
Our fruit so sweet the King will eat, Nor bitter mingle with the sweet.
In our seer's land That glows afar away!

_Chorus_
In our seer's land That glows afar away!

The singing spirits from them fled, and he Alone stood thinking by young
Siduri.

The King leaned on his bow, and eyed the maid, A happy look came in his
eyes,--and fled, For lo! the curtain quick aside is pushed, And
Sabitu within upon them rushed.

She stately glides across the shining floor, And eyes them both,
then turns toward the door.
But Izdubar is equal to the task, With grace now smiling, of the
maid doth ask:
"O Sabitu!

wouldst thou tell me the way To Khasisadra?

for I go this day.

If I the sea may cross, how shall I go?

Or through the desert? thou the path mayst know."

The maiden startled looks upon his face, And thus she answers him with
queenly grace:

"So soon must go? Thou canst not cross the sea, For thou wilt perish in
the waves that way.
Great Samas once the way of me did ask, And I forbade him, but the mighty
task He undertook, and crossed the mighty deep, Where Death's dark waters
lie in wait asleep:
His mighty car of gold swept through the skies, With fiery chargers now he
daily flies.
When I approach thee, thou from me wouldst flee?
But if thou must so soon thus go, the sea Perhaps thou too canst
cross, if thou wilt 'void Death's waters, which relentless ever
glide.

But Izdubar, Ur-Hea, here hath come!
The boatman of the seer, who to his home Returns.

He with an axe in yonder woods A vessel builds to cross the raging
floods.

If thou desirest not to cross with him, We here will welcome thee through
endless time; But if thou goest, may they see thy face Thou
seekest,--welcome thee, and thy heart bless."

COLUMN II

THE KING ON LEAVING THE HAPPY HALLS MEETS UR-HEA, THE BOATMAN OF THE SEER
KHASISADRA--THEY BUILD A SHIP AND EMBARK ON AN UNKNOWN SEA, AND
ON THEIR VOYAGE PASS THROUGH THE WATERS OF DEATH
And Izdubar turned from the Halls and goes Toward a fountain in the
park, whence flows A merry stream toward the wood.

He finds An axe beside the fount, and thoughtful winds, Through groves
of sandal-wood and mastic-trees And algum, umritgana. Now he sees The
sig-a-ri and ummakana, pines, With babuaku; and ri-wood brightly
shines Among the azuhu; all precious woods That man esteems are
grown around, each buds Continuous in the softened, balmy air.

He stops beneath a musrilkanna where The pine-trees spread toward
the glowing sea, Wild mingled with the surman, sa-u-ri.

The King, now seated, with himself communes, Heeds not the warbling
of the birds, and tunes Of gorgeous songsters in the trees around,
But sadly sighing gazes on the ground:
"And I a ship must build; alas!

I know Not how I shall return, if I thus go.
The awful Flood of Death awaits me there, Wide-stretching from this shore--I
know not where." He rests his chin upon his hand in thought, Full
weary of a life that woe had brought; He says: "When I remember Siduri,
Whose heart with fondest love would comfort me Within these Happy
Halls, why should I go To pain and anguish, death, mayhap, and woe?

But will I thus desert my kingdom, throne?

For one I know not! What! my fame alone!
Mine honor should preserve! and royal state!
Alas! this Fame is but a dream of--Fate!

"A longing after that which does not cheer The heart. Applause of men,
or thoughtless sneer, Is naught to me, I am alone! alone!
This Immortality cannot atone For my hard fate that wrings mine aching
heart.
I long for peace and rest, and I must start And find it, leave these
luring bright abodes,-- I seek the immortality of gods.

This Fame of man is not what it doth seem, It sleeps with all the past,
a vanished dream.
My duty calls me to my kingdom, throne!

To Khasisadra go, whose aid alone Can save my people from an awful fate
That hangs above them, born of Fiends of hate.
And I shall there return without my seer!
I live; and he is dead.

Why did I hear His words advising me to come?

Alas!
I sadly all my weary days shall pass; No one shall love me as my seer,
my friend.

"But what said Siduri?--There comes an end At last to sorrow, joy will
hopeful spring On wings of Light! Oh, how my heart will sing!
I bless ye all, ye holy spirits here!
Your songs will linger with me, my heart cheer; Upon my way I turn with
joy again!

How true your joyful song!

your memory then Will keep me hopeful through yon darkened way;
How bright this land doth look beside the sea!"
He looks across the fields; the river glows And winds beside taprani-trees,
and flows By teberinth and groves of tarpikhi And ku-trees; curving round
green mez-kha-i, Through beds of flowers, that kiss its waves and spring
Luxuriant,--with songs the groves far ring.
Now thinking of the ship, he turns his eyes, Toward the fountain,--springs
up with surprise!

"'Tis he! the boatman comes! Ur-Hea comes!

And, oh! at last, I'll reach the glistening domes Of Khasisadra's
palaces,--at last My feet shall rest,--upon that land be placed."
And now Ur-Hea nearer makes his way, And Izdubar addressing him,
doth say:
"Ur-Hea is thy name?

from yonder sea Thou comest, from the seer across the way?"

"Thou speakest truth, great Sar, what wouldst thou have?"

"How shall I Khasisadra reach?

The grave He hath escaped, Immortal lives beyond, For I to him upon
my way am bound; Shall I the waters cross or take my way Through yon wide
desert, for I start this day?"

"Across the sea we go, for I with thee Return to him,--I know the winding
way.
Thine axe of bronze with precious stones inlaid With mine, we'll use
beneath the pine-trees' shade."

And now, within the grove a ship they made, Complete and strong as
wise Ur-Hea bade.

They fell the pines five _gar_ in length, and hew The timbers square,
and soon construct a new And buoyant vessel, firmly fixed the mast,
And tackling, sails, and oars make taut and fast.
Thus built, toward the sea they push its prow, Equipped complete,
provisioned, launch it now.

An altar next they raise and thus invoke The gods, their evil-workings to
revoke:

"[1]O Lord of Charms, Illustrious! who gives Life to the Dead, the Merciful
who lives, And grants to hostile gods of Heaven return, To homage render,
worship thee, and learn Obedience! Thou who didst create mankind
In tenderness, thy love round us, oh, wind!
The Merciful, the God with whom is Life, Establish us, O Lord, in
darkest strife.

O never may thy truth forgotten be, May Accad's race forever worship thee."

One month and fifteen days upon the sea, Thus far the voyagers are on their
way; Now black before them lies a barren shore, O'ertopped with frowning
cliffs, whence comes a roar Of some dread fury of the elements
That shakes the air and sweeping wrath foments O'er winds and seas.

And see! a yawning cave, There opens vast into a void dislave, Where
fremèd shadows ride the hueless waves.

Dread Ninazu whose deathless fury craves For hapless victims lashes with
a roar The mighty seas upon that awful shore.

The Fiends of Darkness gathered lie in wait, With Mammitu, the goddess of
fierce hate, And Gibil[2] with his spells, and Nibiru[3] The twin-god of
black Fate, and grim Nusku[4] The keeper of red thunders, and
Urbat[5] The dog of Death, and fiend of Queen Belat;[6] And Nuk-khu,
and the black-browed Ed-hutu[7] The gods of darkness here with
Tsi-lat-tu.[8] 
And see!

Dark Rimmon[9] o'er a crag alone!

And Gibil with his blasting malisoun, Above with his dark face
maleficent, Who wields a power o'er men omnipotent Forlore!

forlore!

the souls who feel that blast Which sweeps around that black
forbidding coast!

Fierce whirling storms and hurricanes here leap, With blasting lightnings
maltalent and sweep The furious waves that lash around that shore, As the
fierce whirl of some dread maëlstrom's power!

Above the cavern's arch! see! Ninip[10] stands!
He points within the cave with beckoning hands!

Ur-Hea cries: "My lord! the tablets[11] say, That we should not attempt
that furious way!

Those waters of black death will smite us down!
Within that cavern's depths we will but drown." "We cannot go but
once, my friend, that road," The hero said, "'Tis only ghosts'
abode!" "We go, then, Izdubar, its depths will sound, But we within that
gloom will whirl around, Around, within that awful whirlpool
black,-- And once within, we dare not then turn back,-- How many
times, my friend, I dare not say, 'Tis written, we within shall
make our way."

The foaming tide now grasped them with its power, And billowed round them
with continuous roar; Away! they whirl! with growing speed, till now
They fly on lightnings' wings and ride the brow Of maddened tempests
o'er the dizzy deep.

So swift they move,--the waves in seeming sleep Beneath them,
whirling there with force unseen.

But see! Updarting with a sulphurous gleen, The hag of Death leaps on the
trembling prow!
Her eyes, of fire and hate, turns on them now!
With famine gaunt, and haggard face of doom, She sits there soundless
in the awful gloom.

"O gods!"

shrieked Izdubar in his despair, "Have I the god of Fate at last met
here?
Avaunt, thou Fiend!

hence to thy pit of Hell!

Hence! hence!

and rid me of thy presence fell!"

And see! she nearer comes with deathless ire, With those fierce,
moveless, glaring eyes of fire!

Her wand is raised! she strikes!

"O gods!" he screams; He falls beneath that bolt that on them gleams, And
she is gone within the awful gloom.
Hark! hear those screams!
"Accurst! Accurst thy doom!" And lo! he springs upon his feet in pain,
And cries:
"Thy curses, fiend! I hurl again!" And now a blinding flash disparts
the black And heavy air, a moment light doth break; And see! the King
leans fainting 'gainst the mast, With glaring eyeballs, clenched
hands,--aghast!
Behold! that pallid face and scaly hands!
A leper white, accurst of gods, he stands!

A living death, a life of awful woe, Incurable by man, his way shall
go.

But oh! the seer in all enchantments wise Will cure him on that shore, or
else he dies.

And see!

the vessel's prow with shivering turns, Adown the roaring flood
that gapes and churns Beneath like some huge boiling cauldron black,
Thus whirl they in the slimy cavern's track.

And spirit ravens round them fill the air, And see! they fly! the cavern
sweeps behind!
Away the ship doth ride before the wind!
The darkness deep from them has fled away, The fiends are gone!--the vessel
in the spray With spreading sails has caught the glorious breeze,
And dances in the light o'er shining seas; The blissful haven shines
upon their way, The waters of the Dawn sweep o'er the sea!

They proudly ride up to the glowing sand, And joyfully the King
springs to the land.

It seems that the prayers were originally Accadian, and were afterward

COLUMN III
KHASISADRA ON THE SHORE SEES THE VESSEL COMING, AND RETURNING TO
HIS PALACE, SENDS HIS DAUGHTER MUA TO WELCOME IZDUBAR--MEETING OF
THE KING AND SAGE
Beneath a ku-tree Khasisadra eyes The spreading sea beneath the
azure skies, An agèd youth with features grave, serene, Matured
with godly wisdom; ne'er was seen Such majesty, nor young, nor
old,--a seer In purpose high.

The countenance no fear Of death has marred, but on his face sublime
The perfect soul has left its seal through time.

"Ah, yes! the dream was clear, the vision true, I saw him on the ship!
Is it in view?
A speck! Ah, yes! He comes!

he comes to me My son from Erech comes across the sea!" Back to his palace
goes the holy seer, And Mua[1] sends, who now the shore doth near; As
beautiful as Waters of the Dawn, Comes Mua here, as graceful as a
fawn.

The King now standing on the glistening sand, Beholds the beauteous Mua
where she stands, With hands outstretched in welcome to the King, "O thou
sweet spirit, with thy snowy wing, Oh, where is Khasisadra in this
land?

I seek the aid of his immortal hand."

"Great Sar," said Mua, "hadst thou not a seer, That thou shouldst come
to seek my father here?"
"'Tis true, my daughter dear, a seer had I, Whom I have lost,--a dire
calamity; By his advice and love I undertake This journey. But alas!
for mine own sake He fell by perils on this lengthened way; He was
not strong, and feared that he should lay Himself to rest amid the
mountains wild.

He was a warrior, with him I killed Khumbaba, Elam's king who safely dwelt
Within a forest vast of pines, and dealt Destruction o'er the plains.
We razed his walls-- My friend at last before me dying falls.

"Alas! why did my seer attempt to slay The dragons that we met upon the
way, He slew his foe, and like a lion died.

Ah, me! the cause, when I the gods defied, And brought upon us all this
awful woe; In sorrow o'er his death, my life must flow!
For this I came to find the ancient seer, Lead me to him, I pray, if
he lives here."

Then Mua leads him through the glorious land Of matchless splendor, on the
border grand Of those wide Happy Fields that spread afar O'er beaming
hills and vales, where ambient air With sweetest zephyrs sweeps a grand
estrade, Where softest odors from each flowering glade Lull every sense
aswoon that breathes not bliss And harmony with World of
Blessedness.

'Neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way, Through paths of flowers
where night hath fled away, A wilderness of varied crystal flowers,
Where fragrance rests o'er clustering, shining bowers.

Each gleaming cup its nectared wine distils, For spirit lips each
chalice ever fills.

Beyond the groves a lucent palace shone In grandest splendor near
an inner zone; In amethyst and gold divinely rose, With glories
scintillant the palace glows.

A dazzling halo crowns its lofty domes, And spreading from its
summit softly comes With grateful rays, and floods the balustrades
And golden statues 'neath the high arcades; A holy palace built by
magic hand With wondrous architecture, portals grand, And aurine
turrets piled to dizzy heights, Oh, how its glory Izdubar delights!

Beneath majestic arcades carved, they pass, Up golden steps that shine
like polished glass, Through noble corridors with sculptured walls, By
lofty columns, archways to the halls Of glories, the bright harbinger
of fanes Of greater splendor of the Heavenly plains.

Beneath an arch of gems the King espies A form immortal, he who
death defies.

Advancing forth the sage his welcome gives, "'Tis Izdubar who comes
to me and lives!"

Embracing him he leads him in a room, Where many a curious graven
tablet, tome, And scrolls of quaint and old forgotten lore Have
slept within for centuries of yore.

The tablets high are heaped, the alcoves full, Where truth at last
has found a welcome goal.

In wisdom's room, the sage his guest has led, And seats him till
the banquet high is spread; Of Izdubar he learns his journeys great,
How he for aid has left his throne of state.

The maid now comes, him welcomes to the hall Of banquets, where are
viands liberal, And fruits, immortal bread, celestial wines Of
vintage old; and when the hero dines, They lead him to his private
chamber room That overlooks the wondrous garden's bloom Across the
plain and jasper sea divine, To Heaven's mountains rising sapphirine.

Four beauteous streams of liquid silver lead Across the plain;
the shining sea they feed; The King reclines upon his couch at rest, With
dreams of happiness alone is blest.

Then I went into the country of _Comukha,_[1] which was disobedient and
withheld the tribute and offerings due to Ashur my Lord: I conquered the
whole country of Comukha. I plundered their movables, their wealth,
and their valuables.

Their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and ruined.
The common people of Comukha, who fled before the face of my servants,
crossed over to the city of _Sherisha_[2] which was on the further
banks of the Tigris, and made this city into their stronghold.

I assembled my chariots and warriors.

I betook myself to _carts of iron_[3] in order to overcome the rough mountains
and their difficult marches. I made the wilderness (thus) practicable
for the passage of my chariots and warriors.

I crossed the Tigris and took the city of Sherisha their stronghold. Their
fighting men, in the middle of the forests, like wild beasts, I smote.
Their carcasses filled the Tigris, and the tops of the mountains. At
this time the troops of the _Akhe_,[4] who came to the deliverance
and assistance of Comukha, together with the troops of Comukha, like
chaff I scattered. The carcasses of their fighting men I piled up like
heaps on the tops of the mountains.

The bodies of their warriors, the _roaring_[5] waters carried down
to the Tigris.

Kili Teru son of Kali Teru, son of Zarupin Zihusun, their King,[6] in
the course of their fighting fell into my power. His wives and his children,
the delight of his heart I dispossessed him of. One hundred and
eighty[7] iron vessels and 5 trays of copper, together with the
gods of the people in gold and silver, and their beds and furniture
I brought away.

Their movables and their wealth I plundered.

This city and its palace I burnt with fire, I destroyed and ruined.

VII

The city of _Urrakluiras_ their stronghold which was in the country
of Panari, I went toward.

The exceeding fear of the power of Ashur, my Lord, overwhelmed them.

To save their lives they took their gods, and fled like birds to the tops
of the lofty mountains.

I collected my chariots and warriors, and crossed the Tigris. _Shedi
Teru_[1] the son of _Khasutkh_[2] King of _Urrakluiras_ on my
arriving in his country submitted to my yoke.

His sons, the delight of his heart, and his favorites, I condemned to the
service of the gods: 60 vessels of iron; _trays_[3] and _bars_ of
copper ...[4] with 120 cattle, and flocks he brought as tribute and
offerings.

I accepted (them) and spared him.

I gave him his life, but imposed upon him the yoke of my empire
heavily forever.

The wide spreading country of Comukha I entirely conquered, and
subjected to my yoke.

At this time one tray of copper and one bar of copper from among the
service offerings and tribute of Comukha I dedicated to Ashur my Lord,
and 60 iron vessels with their gods I offered to my guardian god, _Vul_.[5]

VIII

From among my valiant servants, to whom Ashur the Lord gave strength and
power, in 30 of my chariots, select companies of my troops and
bands of my warriors who were expert in battle, I gathered together. I
proceeded to the extensive country of _Miltis_,[1] which did not
obey me; it consisted of strong mountains and a difficult land.

Where it was easy I traversed it in my chariots: where it was difficult
I went on foot.

In the country of Aruma, which was a difficult land, and impracticable to
the passage of my chariots, I left the chariots and marched in
front of my troops. Like ...[2] on the peak of the rugged mountains, I
marched victoriously.

The country of _Miltis_,[1] like heaps of stubble, I swept. Their fighting
men in the course of the battle like chaff I scattered.

Their movables, their wealth and their valuables I plundered. Many of
their cities I burned with fire. I imposed on them _religious service_[1],
and offerings and tribute.

IX

Tiglath Pileser, the illustrious warrior, the opener of the roads
of the countries, the subjugator of the rebellious ...[1] he who
has overrun the whole Magian world.

[Footnote 1: Lacuna.]

X

I subdued the extensive country of Subair, which was in rebellion. The
countries of Alza and Purukhuz, which deferred their tribute and
offerings, the yoke of my empire heavily upon them I imposed,
decreeing that they should bring their tribute and offerings into
my presence in the city of Ashur.

While I was on this expedition, which the Lord Ashur, committing
to my hand a powerful rebel subduing army, ordered for the enlargement
of the frontiers of his territory, there were 4,000 of the _Kaskaya_
and _Hurunaya_ rebellious tribes of the Kheti[1] who had brought
under their power the cities of Subarta, attached to the worship
of Ashur, my Lord (so that) they did not acknowledge dependence on
Subarta.

The terror of my warlike expedition overwhelmed them. They would not fight,
but submitted to my yoke. Then I took their valuables, and 120[2] of their
chariots fitted to the yoke, and I gave them to the men of my own
country.

[Footnote 1: Hittites.]

[Footnote 2: Two "soss."]

XI

In the course of this my expedition, a second time I proceeded to
the country of Comukha.

I took many of their cities. Their movables, their wealth, and their
valuables I plundered.

Their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and overthrew. The soldiers
of their armies, who from before the face of my valiant servants
fled away, they would not engage with me in the fierce battle: to
save their lives they took to the stony heights of the mountains,
an inaccessible region: to the recesses of the deep forests and the
peaks of the difficult mountains which had never been trodden by
the feet of men, I ascended after them: they fought with me; I
defeated them: the ranks of their warriors on the tops of the
mountains fell like rain: their carcasses filled the ravines and
the high places of the mountains: their movables, their wealth, and
their valuables I carried off from the stony heights of the mountains.

I subdued the country of Comukha throughout its whole extent, and
I attached it to the frontiers of my own territory.

XII

Tiglath Pileser, the powerful king, the vanquisher of the disobedient,
he who has swept the face of the earth.

XIII

In profound reverence to Ashur my Lord, to the country of Kharia,
and the far-spreading tribes of the Akhe, deep forests, which no
former King (of Assyria) had ever reached, the Lord Ashur invited
me to proceed.

My chariots and forces I assembled, and I went to an inaccessible region
beyond the countries of Itni and Ayá. As the steep mountains stood up
like metal posts, and were impracticable to the passage of my
chariots, I placed my chariots in wagons, and (thus) I traversed
the difficult ranges of hills.

All the lands of the Akhe and their wide-spreading tribes having assembled,
arose to do battle in the country of _Azutapis_. In an inaccessible region
I fought with them and defeated them. The ranks of their (slain)
warriors on the peaks of the mountains were piled up in heaps; the
carcasses of their warriors filled the ravines and high places of
the mountains.

To the cities which were placed on the tops of the mountains I
_penetrated_ victoriously: 27 cities of Kharía, which were situated
in the districts of Aya, Suira, Itni, Shetzu, Shelgu, Arzanibru,
Varutsu, and Anitku, I took; their movables, their wealth, and their
valuables I plundered; their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed
and overthrew.

XIV

The people of Adavas feared to engage in battle with me; they left their
habitations, and fled like birds to the peaks of the lofty mountains.

The terror of Ashur my Lord overwhelmed them; they came and submitted
to my yoke; I imposed on them tribute and offerings.

XV

The countries of Tsaravas and Ammavas, which from the olden time had never
submitted, I swept like heaps of stubble; with their forces in the
country of Aruma I fought, and I defeated them.

The ranks of their fighting men I levelled like grass. I bore away their
gods; their movables, their wealth, and their valuables I carried
off.

Their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and overthrew, and converted
into heaps and mounds. The heavy yoke of my empire I imposed on them.
I attached them to the worship of Ashur my Lord.

XVI

I took the countries of Itsua and Daria, which were turbulent and disobedient.
Tribute and offerings I imposed on them. I attached them to the worship
of Ashur.

XVII

In my triumphant progress over my enemies, my chariots and troops I
assembled; I crossed the lower Zab. The countries of Muraddan
and Tsaradavas, which were near Atsaniu and Atuva, difficult regions, I
captured; their warriors I cut down _like weeds_. The city of Muraddan,
their capital city, and the regions toward the rising sun, I took possession
of. Their gods, their wealth, and their valuables, one _soss_ bars of
iron, 30 talents of iron, the abundant wealth of the Lords, of their
palaces, and their movables, I carried off. This city I burnt with
fire, I destroyed and overthrew.

At this time this iron to the god Vul, my great Lord and guardian, I
dedicated.

XVIII

In the might and power of Ashur my Lord, I went to the country of
Tsugi, belonging to Gilkhi, which did not acknowledge Ashur my Lord.

With 4,000 of their troops, belonging to the countries Khimi, Lukhi, Arirgi,
Alamun, Nuni, and all the far-spread land of the _Akhí_, in the
country of Khirikhi, a difficult region, which rose up like metal
posts, with all their people I fought _on foot_.

I defeated them; the bodies of their fighting men on the tops of
the mountains I heaped in masses.

The carcasses of their warriors I strewed over the country of Khirikhi
like chaff.

I took the entire country of Tsugi.

Twenty-five of their gods, their movables, their wealth, and their
valuables I carried off.

Many of their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and overthrew. The
men of their armies submitted to my yoke. I had mercy on them. I imposed
on them tribute and offerings.

With attachment to the worship of Ashur, my Lord, I intrusted
them.[1] 
[Footnote 1: That is, "I caused them to worship Ashur."]

XIX

At this time 25 of the gods belonging to those countries, subject to my
government, which I had taken, I dedicated for the honor of the
temple of the Queen of glory, the great ancestress of Ashur my Lord,
of Anu, and of Vul, the goddess who is the guardian of all the
public temples of my city of Ashur, and of all the goddesses of my
country.

XX

Tiglath-Pileser, the powerful King; the subduer of hostile races;
the conqueror of the whole circle of kings.

XXI

At this time, in exalted reverence to Ashur, my Lord, by the godlike
support of the heroic "Sun," having in the service of the great
gods, ruled over the four regions imperially; there being found (to
me) no equal in war, and no second in battle, to the countries of
the powerful Kings who dwelt upon the upper ocean and had never
made their submission, the Lord Ashur having urged me, I went.

Difficult mountain chains, and distant (or inaccessible) hills,
which none of our Kings had ever previously reached, tedious paths
and unopened roads I traversed.

The countries of Elama, of Amadana, of Eltís, of Sherabili, of
_Likhuna_, of Tirkakhuli, of Kisra, of Likhanubi, of Elula, of
Khastare, of Sakhisara, of Hubira, of Miliatruni, of _Sulianzi_,
of Nubanashe, and of Sheshe, 16 strong countries, the easy parts
in my chariots, and the difficult parts in wagons of iron, I passed
through; the thickets of the mountains I cut down; bridges for the
passage of my troops I prepared; I crossed over the Euphrates; the
King of Elammi, the King of Tunubi, the King of Tuhali, the King
of Kindari, the King of Huzula, the King of Vanzamuni, the King of
Andiabi, the King of Pilakinna, the King of Atúrgina, the King of
Kulibartzini, the King of Pinibirni, the King of Khimua, the King
of Päíteri, the King of Vaíram, the King of Sururia, the King of
Abäéni, the King of Adäéni, the King of Kirini, the King of Albaya,
the King of Vagina, the King of Nazabia, the King of _Amalziú_, the
King of Dayeni, in all 23 Kings of the countries of Naíri, in their
own provinces having assembled their chariots and troops, they came
to fight with me.[1] By means of my powerful servants I straitened
them.[2] I caused the destruction of their far-spreading troops,
as if with the destroying tempest of Vul.

I levelled the ranks of their warriors, both on the tops of the
mountains and on the battlements of the cities, like _grass_.

Two soss [3] of their chariots I held as a trophy from the midst of the
fight; one soss [4] of the kings of the countries of Naíri, and of those
who had come to their assistance, in my victory as far as the upper
ocean I pursued them; I took their great castles; I plundered their
movables, their wealth and their valuables; their cities I burnt
with fire, I destroyed and overthrew, and converted into heaps and
mounds.

Droves of many horses and mules, of calves and of lambs, their property,
in countless numbers I carried off. Many of the kings of the
countries of Naíri fell alive into my hands; to these kings I granted
pardon; their lives I spared; their abundance and wealth I poured out
before my Lord, the sun-god.

In reverence to my great gods, to after-times, to the last day, I
condemned them to do homage.

The young men, the pride of their royalty, I gave over to the service
of the gods; 1,200 horses and 2,000 cattle I imposed on them as tribute,
and I allowed them to remain in their own countries.

[Footnote 1: Literally, to make war and do battle.]

[Footnote 2: Or, brought them into difficulties.]
[Footnote 3: One hundred and twenty.]
[Footnote 4: Sixty.]

XXII

Tseni, the King of Dayani, who was not submissive to Ashur my Lord,
his abundance and wealth I brought it to my city of Ashur.

I had mercy on him.
I left him in life to learn the worship of the great gods from my
city of Ashur. I reduced the far-spreading countries of Naíri throughout
their whole extent, and many of their kings I subjected to my
yoke.

XXIII

In the course of this expedition, I went to the city of Milidia, belonging
to the country of Khanni-rabbi, which was independent and did not
obey me.

They abstained from engaging in the rude fight with me; they submitted
to my yoke, and I had mercy on them.

This city I did not occupy, but I gave the people over to religious service,
and I imposed on them as a token of their allegiance a fixed tribute
of ...[1] 
[Footnote 1: Lacuna.]

XXIV

Tiglath-Pileser, the ruling constellation; the powerful; the lover of
battle.

XXV

In the service of my Lord Ashur, my chariots and warriors I assembled; I
set out on my march. In front of my strong men I went to the country
of the Aramæans, the enemies of my Lord Ashur. From before Tsukha, as far
as the city of Qarqamis[1] belonging to the country of Khatte,[2] I smote
with _one blow_.

Their fighting men I slew; their movables, their wealth, and their
valuables in countless numbers I carried off.

The men of their armies who fled from before the face of the valiant
servants of my Lord Ashur, crossed over the Euphrates; in boats
covered with bitumen skins I crossed the Euphrates after them; I
took six of their cities which were below the country of Bisri; I
burnt them with fire, and I destroyed and overthrew; and I brought
their movables, their wealth, and their valuables to my city of
Ashur.

[Footnote 1: Carchemish.]
[Footnote 2: The Hittites.]

XXVI

Tiglath-Pileser, he who tramples upon the Magian world; he who subdues the
disobedient; he who has overrun the whole earth.

XXVII

My Lord Ashur having urged me on, I took my way to the vast country of
Muzri, lying beyond Elammi, Tala, and Kharutsa; I took the country of
Muzri throughout its whole extent; I subdued their warriors; I
burnt their cities with fire, I destroyed and overthrew; the troops
of the country of Comani hastened to the assistance of the country
of Muzri: in the mountains I fought with them and defeated them.

In the metropolis, the city of Arin, which was under the country of Ayatsa,
I besieged them; they submitted to my yoke; I spared this city; but
I imposed on them religious service and tribute and offerings.

XXVIII

At this time the whole country of Comani which was in alliance with
the country of Muzri, all their people assembled and arose to do
battle and make war.

By means of my valiant servants I fought with 20,000 of their
numerous troops in the country of Tala, and I defeated them; their
mighty mass broke in pieces; as far as the country of Kharutsa,
belonging to Muzri, I smote them and pursued; the ranks of their
troops on the heights of the mountains I cut down _like grass_;
their carcasses covered the valleys and the tops of the mountains;
their great castles I took, I burnt with fire, I destroyed, and
overthrew into heaps and mounds.

XXIX

The city of Khunutsa, their stronghold, I overthrew like a heap of
stubble.

With their mighty troops in the city and on the hills I fought _fiercely_.
I defeated them; their fighting men in the middle of the forests I scattered
like _chaff_.

I cut off their heads as if they were _carrion_; their carcasses
filled the valleys and (covered) the heights of the mountains.

I captured this city; their gods, their wealth, and their valuables
I carried off, and burnt with fire.

Three of their great castles, which were built of brick, and the entire
city I destroyed and overthrew, and converted into heaps and mounds,
and upon the site I laid down large stones; and I made tablets of
copper, and I wrote on them an account of the countries which I
had taken by the help of my Lord Ashur, and about the taking of
this city, and the building of its castle; and upon it[1] I built
a house of brick, and I set up within it these copper tablets.

[Footnote 1: "The stone foundation."]

XXX

In the service of Ashur my Lord, my chariots and warriors I assembled, and
I approached Kapshuna, their capital city; the tribes of Comani would
not engage in battle with me; they submitted to my yoke, and I spared
their lives. The great castle of the city and its brick buildings I
trampled under foot; from its foundations to its roofs I destroyed
it and converted it into heaps and mounds, and a band of 300 fugitive
heretics who did not acknowledge my Lord Ashur, and who were expelled
from inside this _castle_, I took this band and condemned to the
service of the gods, and I imposed upon the people tribute and
offerings in excess of their former tribute; and the far-spreading
country of Comani throughout its whole extent I reduced under my
yoke.

XXXI

There fell into my hands altogether between the commencement of my reign
and my fifth year 42 countries, with their kings, from beyond the
river Zab, plain, forest, and mountain, to beyond the river Euphrates,
the country of the Khatte[1] and the upper ocean of the setting sun.

I brought them under one government; I placed them under the Magian
religion, and I imposed on them tribute and offerings.

[Footnote 1: Hittites.]

XXXII

I have omitted many hunting expeditions which were not connected with
my warlike achievements. In pursuing after the game I traversed the easy
tracts in my chariots, and the difficult tracts on foot. I demolished
the wild animals throughout my territories.[1]
[Footnote 1: A very difficult paragraph.]

XXXIII

Tiglath-Pileser, the illustrious warrior, he who holds the sceptre
of Lashanan; he who has extirpated all wild animals.

soar; And love then died in all the breasts of men, And strife
supreme on earth was reveling then.

The sexes of mankind their wars divide, And women hate all men, and
them deride; And some demented hurl aside their gowns, And queens
their robes discard and jewelled crowns, And rush upon the streets
bereft of shame, Their forms expose, and all the gods defame.

Alas!

from earth the Queen of Love has gone, And lovers'void their haunts
with faces wan And spurn from them the hateful thought of love, For
love no longer reigns, all life to move.

An awful thrill now speeds through Hades, And life with her," they
cry,"forever dies!"

Through misty glades and darkened depths of space, Tornadoes roar her fate
to Earth's sweet face; The direful tidings from far Hades pour Upon
her bosom with their saddest roar; Like moans of mighty powers in
misery, woe, While icy pangs through all her bosom deep flow.

Her bosom sobbing wails a mighty moan," Alas! forever my sweet queen
hath flown!" With shrieks of hurricane, and ocean's groan, And sobbing
of the winds through heights unknown, ye stars, for me in every sky!
Oh, Samas, hide thy face!

I am undone! Oh, weep with me Ur-ru,[2] my precious son. Let wholly your
notes of joy, my birds, be stilled mother's" heart with dread
despair is filled:" Come rearward, my flowerets, with your fragrant
dews; Come, all my beauties, with your brightest hues; Come back,
my plants and buds and youngling shoots!

Within your mother's bosom hide your roots. Oh, children, children! Love
hath fled away, Alas! that life I gave should see this day! Your queen
lies dying in her awful woe, Oh, why should she from us to Hades
go?"

Wide Nature felt her woe,, and ceased to spring, And withered buds their
vigor lost, and fling No more their fragrance to the lifeless air; The
fruit-trees died, or barren ceased to bear; The male plants kiss
their female plants no more; And pollen on the winds no longer soar
To carry their caresses to the seed Of waiting hearts that unavailing
bleed, Until they fold their petals in despair, And dying drop to
earth, and wither there.

The growing grain no longer fills its head, The fairest fields of
corn lie blasted, dead.

All Nature mourning dons her sad attire, And plants and trees with
falling leaves expire. And Samas' light and moon-god soothing rays
Earth's love no more attracts; undrest Within a Hamath in Syria.] COLUMN

And seat the spirits on their thrones of gold!

Let Ishtar Life's bright waters then behold, And drink her fill,

And Namtar then goes through the palace walls, And flings the light

She drinks the sparkling water now with joy, Which all her form doth
cleanse and purify.

And he at the first gate her robe returns, And leads her through

Prepared for her, and sees her maidens come, time Before a weird

Broke forth afresh, refusing all relief; She smote her breast, my soul

TABLET III--COLUMN I
HEABANI'S WISDOM--SONG OF THE KHAU-IK-I

The dark-eyed maids are dancing in the halls Of Erech's palace: music fills
the walls Of splendor where the Sar-dan-nu[1] enthroned, His hours is
whiling by the maidens zoned; A whirling garland chanting forth a
song.
Accompanied with harps thus sang the throng:

"Heabani's wisdom chant and sing To Erech's king our mighty Sar.[2] When
Hea did Heabani bring, Who now to Erech comes afar, He taught him then
all hidden things Of Ki[3] or bright Samu[4] above, That to the
Mu-di[5] mystery brings.
Oh, how Heabani we shall love!"
_Chorus_

"Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i![6] The Khau-ga[7] chant with waving arms,
The Nin-uit[8] sing Au-un-na-ci[9] Give to our Sar your sweetest
charms.

"All knowledge that is visible Heabani holds it in his glance, Sees visions
inconceivable, The Zi[10] his wizard eyes entrance.
Sweet peace he brings from troubled dreams, He comes to El-li-tar-du-si,[11]
From a far road by mountain streams; Then sing with joy ye
Khau-ik-i!

_Chorus_
"Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i!
The Khau-ga chant with waving arms, The Nin-uit sing An-un-na-ci!

Give to our Sar your sweetest charms.

"E'en all that on the tablet rests, In Erech's tower, the Su-bu-ri,[12]
The beautiful, with glorious crests, He wrote for far posterity.

We plead with him to leave us not, But Zi-Gab-ri[13] him led away,
When our great Shal-man[14] joy us brought, And Elam fled to the
blue sea.

_Chorus_
"Then sing with joy ye Khau-ik-i!
Il-gi-sa-kis-sat[15] from above, The Nin-uit sing An-un-na-ci!
Oh, how Heabani we shall love!"
The maidens note their monarch's moody face, And turn their songs to him
with easy grace, Of their great ruler tune a joyous lay, And oft into
his eyes hurl glances gay; And trumpets join the chorus, rolling drums,
And wild applause from all the chieftains comes, Till the grave seers
and councillors now cry In praise of him they love so tenderly:
With arms upraised the mighty chorus join, Until his heart is filled with
joy divine; And thus they sing with more than royal praise, Their love for
him in every face doth blaze.

SONGS IN PRAISE OF IZDUBAR AND HEABANI AS SUNG BY THE KHAU-IK-I

Our Izdubar dear Erech raised From her distress, when she did mourn;
With joy his glorious name be praised!

Of a great warrior's daughter born, And Bel in his own might, him
arms, To Erech's sons and daughters save; What other Sar hath
glorious charms Like his, who saved proud Elam's slave?

_Chorus_
No rival hath our mighty Sar, Thy cymbals strike and raise the cry!

All hail! All hail! great Izdubar!
His deeds immortal glorify!

Our Izdubar our sons preserves To all our fathers day and night,
And Erech's ruler well deserves Our highest praise, whose matchless
might Delights the gods!

All hail our Sar!

Whose firmness, wisdom need no praise!
Queen Daunat's son, our Izdubar, His glory to the Sami[1] raise!

_Chorus_

Of a great warrior's daughter born, The gods clothe him with matchless
might; His glory greets the coming morn, Oh, how in him we all
delight!

And thus of Seer Heabani they now chant His birth and history and hyemal
haunt.

Who can compare with thee, O Nin![2] The son of Bel; thy hands didst lay
Upon Ar-ur-u, thine own queen, With glory crowned her on that day.

To her thy strength did give, and blessed Her with thy love and a dear
son; With Ami's strength within his breast, And Ninip sped then
to his throne.

When Queen Ar-u-ru hears her lord From Erech's city far has gone, She
bows her head upon the sward, With pleading hands in woe
doth moan.

And to Heabani she gave birth, The warrior, great Ninip's son, Whose fame
is spread through all the earth.
The queen with her own maids alone Retired within her palace walls For
purity in Erech's halls.

Like the corn-god his face concealed, Of men and countries he
possessed, Great wisdom by the gods revealed:
As Ner[3] the god, his limbs were dressed.

With wild gazelles he ate his food While roaming with them in the night;
For days he wandered in the wood, And bu-hir-tser-i[4] him delight.

The Zi-ar-ri[5] Heabani loves, That play within the running streams;
With Zi-ti-am-a-ti[6] he roves Upon the sands in warm sunbeams.

"The prince returns, O Sar!" the herald said, And low before the
throne he bowed his head; "Our Zaidu, the bewitcher of all men,
Doth unsuccessful to us come again.

Before the cave the seer confronted him Three days where Khar-sak's snowy
brow doth gleam.

Heabani with his beast in his cave went, And Zaidu waited, but his
courage spent When he beheld the seer and beast remain Within the cave,
and all his words were vain.
The prince remains without with downcast face, And beg of thee, his
Sar, thy sovereign grace." The king to all the maidens waves his hand,
Then vanishes from sight the choral band.

ZAIDU'S RETURN, AND HIS INSTRUCTION TO TAKE TWO MAIDS WITH HIM TO ENTICE
THE SEER FROM HIS CAVE

Prince Zaidu prostrate bows before the Sar, Arises, thus narrates to
Izdubar:
"Thy sovereign, Zaidu hath his king obeyed, The royal mission I
have thus essayed As Amu's[1] soldier; I undaunted tried To urge
my mission which the seer denied.

I firmly met the beast that with him came:

Unmanly fear, confess I to my shame, Came o'er me when I first beheld
the beast, In vain I plead, and in despair I ceased When he refused, and
angry from me passed Within his cave, where cliffs and rocks are massed;
I climbed, but the wild entrance did not gain, And for advice have
I returned again."

"'Tis well, my son," the Sar to Zaidu said, "Thy wisdom I commend
for thy young head, Again upon thy mission thou must go.

His might, and strength of purpose, thou dost know, Before a maiden's
charms will flee away; For he doth love the Zi-Ga-bri[2] that play
Within the mountain gorges. Turn thy face Again with manly portance; for
I'll grace Thine embassy with two of our sweet maids, Who oft shall cheer
thee through the mountain glades, Whom thou shalt lead before Heabani's
den With their bright charms exposed within the glen.
Take Sam-kha-tu and sweet Khar-imatu:
They will entice the seer when he shall view Their charms displayed
before his wondering eyes.

With Sam-kha, Joy, the seer you will surprise; Khar-im-tu will thy plans
successful end, To her seductive glance his pride will bend.

Sweet Sam-kha's charms are known, she is our Joy, As Ishtar's aid her
charms ne'er cloy; Kharun-tu with her perfect face and form, The hearts
of all our court doth take by storm:
When joys by our sweet Sam-kha are distilled, Kharun-tu's love overcomes
us till we yield.
Thus, armed with Love's Seduction and her Joy, The greatest powers of earth
thou dost employ; No flesh can face them but a heart of stone.
And all the world doth lie before them prone."
Three days Prince Zaidu sat with Kharun-tu Before the cave within
Heabani's view; Beside the pool they waited for the seer:
From Erech three days' journey brought them here, But where hath
Joy, sweet Sam-kha, roving gone?

When they arrived at setting of the sun She disappeared within with waving
arms; With bright locks flowing she displayed her charms.
As some sweet _zir-ru_ did young Sam-kha seem, A thing of beauty of some
mystic dream.

[Footnote 1: "Anu," the King of Heaven.]
[Footnote 2: "Zi-Gab-ri," spirits of the mountains.]

COLUMN IV

THE TWO MAIDENS ENTICE THE SEER

Thus in Heabani's cave the maiden went, And o'er the sleeping seer
her form she bent; O'er him who with gazelles oft eats his food;
O'er him who drinks with _bhu-ri_[1] in the wood; O'er him who loves
the _zir-ri,_--of them dreams, And sports with them within the
mountain streams.

And when the gay enticer saw the seer Unconscious sleeping with sweet
Joy so near, She clasped him to her breast and kissed his brow.

The seer awakes, with wonder eyes her now:
"Thy glory thou hast brought to me!" he saith, "Sweet Zir-ru comes to me
with fragrant breath!" And with delight he eyes her beauteous form,
His breast warm moved by the enticer's charm.
He springs upon his feet and her pursues:
She laughing flees; to sport with him doth choose.

And now he eyes his hairy body, arms Compared to Sam-kha's snowy
god-like charms, She give to him her freshness, blooming youth?
She laughing comes again to him,--Forsooth!
Her glorious arms she opens, flees away, While he doth follow the enticer
gay.
He seizes, kisses, takes away her breath, And she falls to the
ground--perhaps in death He thinks, and o'er her leans where she
now lay; At last she breathes, and springs, and flees away.

But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues; But glancing back his arms
she doth refuse.
And thus three days and four of nights she played; For of Heabani's love
she was afraid.
Her joyous company doth him inspire For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and
wild desire.
He was not satisfied unless her form Remained before him with her
endless charm.

But when his _bhu-ri_ of the field the sight Beheld, the wild gazelles
fled in affright.
And now without the cave they came in view Of Zaidu waiting with sweet
Kharim-tu,

And when Heabani saw the rounded form Of bright Kharim-tu, her
voluptuous charm Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate With
wistful face, resigned to any fate.

Kharim-tu, smiling sweetly, bent her head, Enticing him the tempter coyly
said, "Heabani, like a famous god thou art, Why with these creeping
things doth sleep thy heart?
Come thou with me to Erech Su-bu-ri[2] To Anu's temple Elli-tar-du-si, And
Ishtar's city where great Izdubar Doth reign, the glorious giant king of
war; Whose mighty strength above his chiefs doth tower, Come see our giant
king of matchless power." Her flashing eyes half languid pierce the
seer, Until his first resolves all disappear.

And rising to his feet his eyes he turned Toward sweet Joy,[3] whose
love for him yet burned; And eyeing both with beaming face he saith, "With
Sam-kha's love the seer hath pledged his faith; And I will go to
Elli-tar-du-si, Great Anu's seat and Ishtar's where with thee, I will
behold the giant Izdubar, Whose fame is known to me as king of
war; And I will meet him there, and test the power Of him whose
fame above all men doth tower.

A _mid-dan-nu_[4] to Erech I will take, To see if he its mighty strength
can break.
In these wild caves its strength has mighty grown; If he the beast
destroys, I will make known His dream to him--e'en all the seer
doth know; And now with thee to Erech I will go.

FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF HEABANI, WHO ARRIVES AT ERECH--INTERPRETATION OF THE
DREAM

The sounds of wild rejoicing now arise; "Heabani comes!" resound the
joyful cries, And through the gates of Erech Suburi Now file the
chieftains, Su-khu-li rubi.[1] A festival in honor of their guest The Sar
proclaims, and Erech gaily drest, Her welcome warm extends to the
famed seer.

The maidens, Erech's daughters, now appear, With richest kirtles gaily
decked with flowers, And on his head they rain their rosy showers.

Rejoicing sing, while harps and cymbals play, And laud him to the skies
in their sweet way; And mingling with their joy, their monarch
rode Before the seer, who stately after strode Beside his beast,
and next the men of fame.

The maids thus chant high honors to his name:

"A prince we make thee, mighty seer!
Be filled with joy and royal cheer!

All hail to Erech's seer!

Whom day and night our Sar hath sought, O banish fear! for Hea taught The
seer, his glory wrought.

He comes! whom Samas loves as gold, To Erech grace, our city old; All
wisdom he doth hold.

Great Hea doth to him unfold All that remains to man untold; Give
him the chain of gold!

He cometh from the Za-Gab-ri To our dear Erech Su-bu-ri.
Heabani glorify!

Thy dream he will reveal, O Sar!
Its meaning show to Izdubar, Victorious king of war."

Within the council halls now lead the seers With trepidation and with
many fears, To hear the seer explain their monarch's dream.

Beside the royal throne he sits supreme Among the seers, the Sar, his
scribe commands To read his dream recorded as it stands In Erech's
Gi;[2] who reads it to the seer, Who answers thus:
"In this there doth appear A god, whose ardent love will lead to
deeds Of hate against thee, Sar; thy present needs Are great, O king!

as fire this love will burn Until the wicked seven[3] on thee turn;
And blood, alone, will not their fury sate:
The gods will hurl upon thee some dread fate."

In silence, Izdubar the warning heard; His blood with terror froze,
and then was stirred By passions wild, when he recalled the scene
Of Ishtar's love for him by man unseen; When she so wildly then
proclaimed her love; And now with hate his inmost soul doth move,
And her bright form to a black dal-khu[4] turned And furious passions
on his features burned.

And then of the first dream he thought, and light Across his vision
broke:
"'Tis true!

aright Thy seer hath read! for Ishtar came to me In the first dream, her
face e'en yet I see!

Aye, more! her lips to mine again then fell!

Her arms I felt around me,--breath too well I know!

of fragrance, while perfume arose Around my dream and fled not at the
close; As frankincense and myrrh it lingered, when I woke. Ah yes!
the queen will come again!" Then to his counsellor who wondering stood,
Nor heard his murmuring, but saw subdued His features were, at
first, and then, they grand Became with settled hate; he raised his

So stand aside, my friends, behold the test!
Your Sar will satisfy his seer and guest."Accordingly
it may be assumed that, when the pontifical college in the first half
of the fifth century proceeded to substitute for the former scanty
records--ordinarily, doubtless, confined to the names of the
magistrates--the scheme of a formal yearly chronicle, it also added
what was wanting at the beginning, the history of the kings of Rome
and of their fall, and, by placing the institution of the republic
on the day of the consecration of the Capitoline temple, the 13th
of Sept. 245, furnished a semblance of connection between the
dateless and the annalistic narrative.

That in this earliest record of the origin of Rome the hand of
Hellenism was at work, can scarcely be doubted.

The speculations as to the primitive and subsequent population, as
to the priority of pastoral life over agriculture, and the
transformation of the man Romulus into the god Quirinus,(17) have
quite a Greek aspect, and even the obscuring of the genuinely
national forms of the pious Numa and the wise Egeria by the admixture
of alien elements of Pythagorean primitive wisdom appears by no
means to be one of the most recent ingredients in the Roman prehistoric
annals.

The pedigrees of the noble clans were completed in a manner analogous
to these -origines- of the community, and were, in the favourite
style of heraldry, universally traced back to illustrious ancestors.

The Aemilii, for instance, Calpurnii, Pinarii, and Pomponii professed
to be descended from the four sons of Numa, Mamercus, Calpus, Pinus, and
Pompo; and the Aemilii, yet further, from Mamercus, the son of Pythagoras,
who was named the "winning speaker" (--aimulos--)
But, notwithstanding the Hellenic reminiscences that are everywhere
apparent, these prehistoric annals of the community and of the leading
houses may be designated at least relatively as national, partly because
they originated in Rome, partly because they tended primarily to
form links of connection not between Rome and Greece, but between
Rome and Latium.

Hellenic Early History of Rome
It was Hellenic story and fiction that undertook the task of connecting
Rome and Greece.

Hellenic legend exhibits throughout an endeavour to keep pace with
the gradual extension of geographical knowledge, and to form a
dramatized geography by the aid of its numerous stories of voyagers
and emigrants.

In this, however, it seldom follows a simple course.

An account like that of the earliest Greek historical work which mentions
Rome, the "Sicilian History" of Antiochus of Syracuse (which ended in
330)--that a man named Sikelos had migrated from Rome to Italia, that
is, to the Bruttian peninsula --such an account, simply giving a historical
form to the family affinity between the Romans, Siculi, and
Bruttians, and free from all Hellenizing colouring, is a rare
phenomenon.

Greek legend as a whole is pervaded--and the more so, the later its
rise--by a tendency to represent the whole barbarian world as having
either issued from the Greeks or having been subdued by them; and
it early in this sense spun its threads also around the west.

18. This restriction of the ancient full reciprocity of Latin rights first
occurs in the renewal of the treaty in 416 (Liv. viii. 14); but
as the system of isolation, of which it was an essential part, first
began in reference to the Latin colonies settled after 370, and was
only generalized in 416, it is proper to mention this alteration
here.

19.

The name itself is very ancient; in fact it is the most ancient indigenous
name for the inhabitants of the present Calabria (Antiochus, Fr. 5. Mull.).
The well-known derivation is doubtless an invention.

20. Perhaps no section of the Roman annals has been more disfigured than
the narrative of the first Samnite-Latin war, as it stands or stood
in Livy, Dionysius, and Appian. It runs somewhat to the following
effect.

After both consuls had marched into Campania in 411, first the
consul Marcus Valerius Corvus gained a severe and bloody victory
over the Samnites at Mount Gaurus; then his colleague Aulus Cornelius
Cossus gained another, after he had been rescued from annihilation
in a narrow pass by the self-devotion of a division led by the
military tribune Publius Decius.

The third and decisive battle was fought by both consuls at the
entrance of the Caudine Pass near Suessula; the Samnites were
completely vanquished--forty thousand of their shields were picked
up on the field of battle--and they were compelled to make a peace,
in which the Romans retained Capua, which had given itself over to
their possession, while they left Teanum to the Samnites (413).

Congratulations came from all sides, even from Carthage.

The Latins, who had refused their contingent and seemed to be arming
against Rome, turned their arms not against Rome but against the
Paeligni, while the Romans were occupied first with a military
conspiracy of the garrison left behind in Campania (412), then with
the capture of Privernum (413) and the war against the Antiates.

But now a sudden and singular change occurred in the position of
parties.

The Latins, who had demanded in vain Roman citizenship and a share
in the consulate, rose against Rome in conjunction with the Sidicines,
who had vainly offered to submit to the Romans and knew not how to
save themselves from the Samnites, and with the Campanians, who
were already tired of the Roman rule.

Only the Laurentes in Latium and the -equites- of Campania adhered to the
Romans, who on their part found support among the Paeligni and Samnites.
The Latin army fell upon Samnium; the Romano-Samnite army, after it had
marched to the Fucine lake and from thence, avoiding Latium, into Campania,
fought the decisive battle against the combined Latins and Campanians at
Vesuvius; the consul Titus Manlius Imperiosus, after he had himself
restored the wavering discipline of the army by the execution of
his own son who had slain a foe in opposition to orders from
headquarters, and after his colleague Publius Decius Mus had appeased
the gods by sacrificing his life, at length gained the victory by
calling up the last reserves.

But the war was only terminated by a second battle, in which the consul
Manlius engaged the Latins and Campanians near Trifanum; Latium and Capua
submitted, and were mulcted in a portion of their territory.

The judicious and candid reader will not fail to observe that this
report swarms with all sorts of impossibilities.

Such are the statement of the Antiates waging war after the surrender
of 377 (Liv.

vi. 33); the independent campaign of the Latins against the Paeligni,
in distinct contradiction to the stipulations of the treaties between
Rome and Latium; the unprecedented march of the Roman army through the
Marsian and Samnite territory to Capua, while all Latium was in arms
against Rome; to say nothing of the equally confused and sentimental
account of the military insurrection of 412, and the story of its
forced leader, the lame Titus Quinctius, the Roman Gotz von
Berlichingen.

Still more suspicious perhaps, are the repetitions.
Such is the story of the military tribune Publius Decius modelled
on the courageous deed of Marcus Calpurnius Flamma, or whatever he
was called, in the first Punic war; such is the recurrence of the
conquest of Privernum by Gaius Plautius in the year 425, which
second conquest alone is registered in the triumphal Fasti; such
is the self-immolation of Publius Decius, repeated, as is well
known, in the case of his son in 459.

Throughout this section the whole representation betrays a different
period and a different hand from the other more credible accounts of the
annals. The narrative is full of detailed pictures of battles; of inwoven
anecdotes, such as that of the praetor of Setia, who breaks his neck on
the steps of the senate-house because he had been audacious enough
to solicit the consulship, and the various anecdotes concocted out
of the surname of Titus Manlius; and of prolix and in part suspicious
archaeological digressions.

In this class we include the history of the legion--of which the notice,
most probably apocryphal, in Liv. i. 52, regarding the maniples of Romans
and Latins intermingled formed by the second Tarquin, is evidently a second
fragment, the erroneous view given of the treaty between Capua and
Rome (see my Rom.

Munzwesen, p. 334, n. 122); the formularies of self-devotion, the Campanian
-denarius-, the Laurentine alliance, and the -bina jugera- in the
assignation (p. 450, note).

Under such circumstances it appears a fact of great weight that
Diodorus, who follows other and often older accounts, knows absolutely
nothing of any of these events except the last battle at Trifanum; a
battle in fact that ill accords with the rest of the narrative, which,
in accordance with the rules of poetical justice, ought to have
concluded with the death of Decius.

CHAPTER VI

Struggle of the Italians against Rome

Wars between the Sabellians and Tarentines-- Archidamus-- Alexander the
Molossian--
While the Romans were fighting on the Liris and Volturnus, other conflicts
agitated the south-east of the peninsula. The wealthy merchant-republic
of Tarentum, daily exposed to more serious peril from the Lucanian
and Messapian bands and justly distrusting its own sword, gained
by good words and better coin the help of -condottieri- from the
mother-country.

The Spartan king, Archidamus, who with a strong band had come to
the assistance of his fellow-Dorians, succumbed to the Lucanians
on the same day on which Philip conquered at Chaeronea (416); a
retribution, in the belief of the pious Greeks, for the share which
nineteen years previously he and his people had taken in pillaging
the sanctuary of Delphi.

His place was taken by an abler commander, Alexander the Molossian, brother
of Olympias the mother of Alexander the Great. In addition to the troops
which he had brought along with him he united under his banner the contingents
of the Greek cities, especially those of the Tarentines and Metapontines;
the Poediculi (around Rubi, now Ruvo), who like the Greeks found themselves
in danger from the Sabellian nation; and lastly, even the Lucanian
exiles themselves, whose considerable numbers point to the existence of
violent internal troubles in that confederacy. Thus he soon found himself
superior to the enemy. Consentia (Cosenza), which seems to have been
the federal headquarters of the Sabellians settled in Magna Graecia,
fell into his hands.

In vain the Samnites came to the help of the Lucanians; Alexander defeated
their combined forces near Paestum. He subdued the Daunians around
Sipontum, and the Messapians in the south-eastern peninsula; he
already commanded from sea to sea, and was on the point of arranging
with the Romans a joint attack on the Samnites in their native
abodes.

But successes so unexpected went beyond the desires of the Tarentine
merchants, and filled them with alarm.

War broke out between them and their captain, who had come amongst them
a hired mercenary and now appeared desirous to found a Hellenic
empire in the west like his nephew in the east.

Alexander had at first the advantage; he wrested Heraclea from the
Tarentines, restored Thurii, and seems to have called upon the other
Italian Greeks to unite under his protection against the Tarentines,
while he at the same time tried to bring about a peace between them
and the Sabellian tribes.

But his grand projects found only feeble support among the degenerate and
desponding Greeks, and the forced change of sides alienated from him his
former Lucanian adherents: he fell at Pandosia by the hand of a
Lucanian emigrant (422).(1) On his death matters substantially
reverted to their old position.

The Greek cities found themselves once more isolated and once more left
to protect themselves as best they might by treaty or payment of
tribute, or even by extraneous aid; Croton for instance repulsed
the Bruttii about 430 with the help of the Syracusans.

The Samnite tribes acquire renewed ascendency, and were able, without
troubling themselves about the Greeks, once more to direct their
eyes towards Campania and Latium.

But there during the brief interval a prodigious change had occurred.

The Latin confederacy was broken and scattered, the last resistance
of the Volsci was overcome, the province of Campania, the richest
and finest in the peninsula, was in the undisputed and well-secured
possession of the Romans, and the second city of Italy was a
dependency of Rome.

While the Greeks and Samnites were contending with each other, Rome had
almost without a contest raised herself to a position of power
which no single people in the peninsula possessed the means of
shaking, and which threatened to render all of them subject to her
yoke.

A joint exertion on the part of the peoples who were not severally a
match for Rome might perhaps still burst the chains, ere they
became fastened completely.

But the clearness of perception, the courage, the self-sacrifice
required for such a coalition of numerous peoples and cities that
had hitherto been for the most part foes or at any rate strangers
to each other, were not to be found at all, or were found only when
it was already too late.

Coalition of the Italians against Rome

After the fall of the Etruscan power and the weakening of the Greek
republics, the Samnite confederacy was beyond doubt, next to Rome,
the most considerable power in Italy, and at the same time that
which was most closely and immediately endangered by Roman
encroachments.

To its lot therefore fell the foremost place and the heaviest burden in
the struggle for freedom and nationality which the Italians had
to wage against Rome.

It might reckon upon the assistance of the small Sabellian tribes,
the Vestini, Frentani, Marrucini, and other smaller cantons, who
dwelt in rustic seclusion amidst their mountains, but were not deaf
to the appeal of a kindred stock calling them to take up arms in
defence of their common possessions.

The assistance of the Campanian Greeks and those of Magna Graecia
(especially the Tarentines), and of the powerful Lucanians and
Bruttians would have been of greater importance; but the negligence
and supineness of the demagogues ruling in Tarentum and the entanglement
of that city in the affairs of Sicily, the internal distractions of the
Lucanian confederacy, and above all the deep hostility that had
subsisted for centuries between the Greeks of Lower Italy and their
Lucanian oppressors, scarcely permitted the hope that Tarentum and
Lucania would make common cause with the Samnites.

From the Sabines and the Marsi, who were the nearest neighbours of the
Romans and had long lived in peaceful relations with Rome, little more
could be expected than lukewarm sympathy or neutrality. The
Apulians, the ancient and bitter antagonists of the Sabellians,
were the natural allies of the Romans.

On the other hand it might be expected that the more remote Etruscans
would join the league if a first success were gained; and even a
revolt in Latium and the land of the Volsci and Hernici was not
impossible.

But the Samnites--the Aetolians of Italy, in whom national vigour still
lived unimpaired--had mainly to rely on their own energies for such
perseverance in the unequal struggle as would give the other peoples
time for a generous sense of shame, for calm deliberation, and for
the mustering of their forces; a single success might then kindle
the flames of war and insurrection all around Rome.

History cannot but do the noble people the justice of acknowledging that
they understood and performed their duty.

Outbreak of War between Samnium and Rome-- Pacification of Campania

Differences had already for several years existed between Rome and
Samnium in consequence of the continual aggressions in which the
Romans indulged on the Liris, and of which the founding of Fregellae
in 426 was the latest and most important.

But it was the Greeks of Campania that gave occasion to the outbreak
of the contest.

After Cumae and Capua had become Roman, nothing so naturally suggested
itself to the Romans as the subjugation of the Greek city Neapolis,
which ruled also over the Greek islands in the bay--the only town
not yet reduced to subjection within the field of the Roman power.

The Tarentines and Samnites, informed of the scheme of the Romans
to obtain possession of the town, resolved to anticipate them; and
while the Tarentines were too remiss perhaps rather than too distant
for the execution of this plan, the Samnites actually threw into
it a strong garrison.

The Romans immediately declared war nominally against the Neapolitans,
really against the Samnites (427), and began the siege of Neapolis.

After it had lasted a while, the Campanian Greeks became weary of
the disturbance of their commerce and of the foreign garrison; and
the Romans, whose whole efforts were directed to keep states of the
second and third rank by means of separate treaties aloof from the
coalition which was about to be formed, hastened, as soon as the
Greeks consented to negotiate, to offer them the most favourable
terms--full equality of rights and exemption from land service,
equal alliance and perpetual peace.

Upon these conditions, after the Neapolitans had rid themselves of
the garrison by stratagem, a treaty was concluded (428).

The Sabellian towns to the south of the Volturnus, Nola, Nuceria,
Herculaneum, and Pompeii, took part with Samnium in the beginning
of the war; but their greatly exposed situation and the machinations
of the Romans--who endeavoured to bring over to their side the
optimate party in these towns by all the levers of artifice and
self-interest, and found a powerful support to their endeavours in
the precedent of Capua--induced these towns to declare themselves
either in favour of Rome or neutral not long after the fall of
Neapolis.

Alliance between the Romans and Lucanians
A still more important success befell the Romans in Lucania.

There also the people with true instinct was in favour of joining the
Samnites; but, as an alliance with the Samnites involved peace with
Tarentum and a large portion of the governing lords of Lucania
were not disposed to suspend their profitable pillaging expeditions,
the Romans succeeded in concluding an alliance with Lucania--an
alliance which was invaluable, because it provided employment for
the Tarentines and thus left the whole power of Rome available
against Samnium.

Stuart had closed with the offer, when suddenly
the man was seized at the instance of the French ambassador, and his
papers were searched.[291] surmise that he was the victim of a
plot of which murder.

Finally, the First Consul charged Savary, who had just returned to
Paris from Biville, furious at being baulked of his, to. proceed
to Vincennes with a band of his gendarmes for the carrying out of the
sentence.

The seven officers as yet knew nothing of him of the danger of his
position, he replied that he knew it, and wished to have an interview
with the but it seems wrongly, attributed to Fouché, well sums up
the general opinion of on the nature of their mission, or of martial
law."

We had which Talleyrand gave to young aspirants--"et surtout pas trop de
zèle."

Thus, while the royalists were conspiring the overthrow of Napoleon, he
through his agents was countermining their clumsy approach to his citadel,
and prepared to blow them sky high when their mines were crowded

It has been stated that the plot never aimed at assassination, but
at the overpowering of the First Consul's escort, and the seizure
of his person, during one of his the future fortune of Moreau in
the campaign of 1793, and yet he had seemed to be the victim of
that general's gross ingratitude at Fructidor.

Who then so fitted as he?

Through a priest named David and Zutzig General Lajolais, an interview, was
arranged; and shortly Georges Cadoudal, whose cell was hard by, heard
no sound of a scuffle; and it unlikely that so strong a man as Pichegru
would easily have succumbed to assailants. came to journeys.

Then he was to be forcibly transferred to the northern coast on
relays of horses, and hurried over to.[292] But, which he closed
with the written and urgent request for a personal interview, though
the plotters threw the veil of decency over their enterprise only
of the seizure and deportation of the First Consul.

Whatever may have been their precise aims, they were certainly known to
Napoleon and his police. On November 1st, 1803, he wrote to Régnier:"
You must be in a hurry about the by arrests: when the author[ Méhée] has
given in all the information, we will draw up a plan with him, and will
see what is to be done. I wish him to write, and."[303] The It is therefore
more probable that the conqueror of Holland, shattered by his misfortunes
and too proud to undergo a public trial, cut short a life which already
was doomed. Never have plotters failed more ignominiously and played more
completely into the hands of their enemy. A_mot_ of the Boulevards wittily
sums up the results of their puny efforts:" They execution of the Duc
d'Enghien is one of the most important incidents of this period,
in order to make him trustful, inform him that, before the great
blow be dealt, he believes he[ Méhée] can promise to have seized
on the table of the First Consul, in his secret room, notes written
in his own hand relating to his great expedition, and every other
important document."

Napoleon revelled in the details of his plan for hoisting the engineers
with their own petards.[293] But have he knew full well that the plot,
when fully ripe, would yield more than the capture of a few Chouans. He
must her wait until Moreau was implicated. The man selected by
the_émigrés_ That to sound Moreau was Pichegru, and this choice
was the sole named a commission of its members to report on hereditary
rule, and then waited on events.

These were decided mainly in private meetings Merlin, and Thibaudeau. But
of what avail are private remonstrances when in open session

In the Tribunate, on April 23rd, an obscure member named Curée proposed

clasped hands in the capital which had so often resounded with
their praises( January, 1804).

They met three or four times, and cleared away for the final rush. The
haunt not do not ask me to put a." From this resolve Moreau never receded.
But his calculating reserve did not save him. Already several suspects
had been imprisoned in Normandy. At Napoleon's suggestion five of them
were condemned to, in the hope of extorting a confession; and the
last a man named Querelle, gratified his gaolers by revealing February

long afterwards," the least this case" there were none that it
compromised Stuart, and his career was not cut in the ignominious
manner that befall Drake, execution of Enghien, helped on the
establishment of the Empire.

Though moderate men of all parties condemned the murder, the remnants of
the Jacobin party hailed of Monk.

The pomp of the Tuileries of Vincennes over whom there may be
inscribed as epitaph the warning England.[294] Elated by this
success, and hoping to catch the Comte d'Artois himself, Napoleon
forthwith despatched to that cliff one of his most crafty sight,
he used his utmost arts to imitate the signals that invited a
landing.

But the crew were not to be lured to shore; and after fruitless endeavours
he returned to Paris--in time to take part in the murder of the
Duc d'Enghien the heart.

Out of pantomime--she eleven only the last three referred to the
duke's connection with the Cadoudal plot.[297] For in the meantime had
found I in the duke's papers proofs of his having offered his services
to the British Government for the present war,[298] his hopes of.
Meanwhile the police were on the tracks of Pichegru and Georges.

On the last day of February the general was seized in bed in house of a
treacherous friend: but not until the gates of Paris had been
closed, and domiciliary visits made, was Georges taken, and then
only after a desperate affray( March 9th).

The arrest of the two Polignacs and the for de Rivière speedily followed.
Hitherto Napoleon effect( blank) condemned him to suffer death." Ashamed,
as it would seem, of this clumsy condemnation, Hulin was writing
to Bonaparte to request for the condemned man the personal interview
which he craved, when Savary take the pen from his had completely
outwitted his foes.

He knew well enough that he was in no danger." I have
run no real risks," he wrote to Melzi," Condé he an otherwise monotonous
life, until he was fired with the closest investigation to be made. One

In reality the general was in London, and the spy had substituted the

Dumouriez with that of the young duke his rage knew no bounds and the
saviour of the country. His mother hotly upbraided him, saying it was an
atrocious act, the stain of could never be wiped the Council of State,
where the proposal met with some opposition from Cambacérès." Am I
a dog to be beaten to death in the street?

Why was I not warned that they were assembling at Ettenheim? Are my
murderers sacred beings? They attack my very person. I'll give
them war for war." And he overwhelmed with reproaches both Réal and
Talleyrand for neglecting to warn him of these traitors and assassins
clustering on the banks of the Rhine.

The seizure not only Georges but also the Polignacs and Rivière always
arose. This convinced Napoleon that the Duc d'Enghien was directing the
plot, and he determined to have the duke and Dumouriez seized. That
they were far adopted in view of the Moreau prosecution. But the certainty"
of a conviction was not enough at: Napoleon determined to strike
terror into France; but he indignantly denied it.

His other letters also prove that he was not to an accomplice
Napoleon's favours.

Many of his friends ventured to show their horror of this Corsican
vendetta; and a_mot_ which plausibly, an informal Sanhedrin.

Talleyrand, Réal, and Fouché advised the severest measures.

The name of Plessis was assigned to the victim, and Harel, the

To the last questions he answered decisively in the affirmative, adding
that he wished to of Georges Cadoudal and the examination of one
of his servants helped to confirm Napoleon's the duke and Dumouriez were
the real contrivers, while Georges was their tool.

Cadoudal's servant stated that there often came to his master's house a
mysterious man, at whose shocked entry take part in the new war
against France. His replies were the same as he made in his
preliminary examination with Napoleon.

To this request the court proposed to accede; but Savary, who had
posted himself behind Hulin's chair, at once declared this step to
be_inopportune_.

The judges had only one chance of escape from their predicament, namely,
to induce the duke to invalidate his evidence: this he firmly refused
to do, and when Hulin warned German soil was naught to him. Talleyrand

But Napoleon's spies gave information which seemed to implicate him
in that enterprise.

Chief among them was Méhée, who, at the close of February, hovered about
Ettenheim and heard that the duke was far from Dieppe, on August caution:"
I always intended to end the Revolution by the establishment of heredity:

Paris, and spent some months" in striving to some of the misunderstandings

mooted the overthrow of Bonaparte and the restoration of the Bourbons,
he firmly warned him:" Do with Bonaparte what you will, but often

Napoleon received this news on March looked on Bonaparte as the hero of

forthwith led out into the moat of the castle, where a few torches
shed their light on the final scene of this sombre tragedy: he asked
for a priest, but this was denied him: he governor had caused to
be made ready; into this the body was thrown pell-mell, and the
earth closed over the remains of the last scion of the warlike House
of Condé.

Twelve years later loving hands disinterred the bones and placed
them in the chapel of the castle.

But even then the world knew not all the indecency of the.

It was reserved for clumsy apologists like Savary to provoke replies
and further investigations.

The various excuses extraordinary which which had previously been offered
to the credulity or malice of his courtiers, and took on himself
the responsibility for the execution:" I caused the Duc d'Enghien
to be arrested and judged, because it hide-and-seek throw the blame
on Talleyrand, and on everyone but the chief Her charms, the
attractions of the chase, the society of a small circle of
French_émigrés_, and an occasional secret visit to the theatre at

In that document Napoleon brushed away the excuses was necessary for the
safety, the interest, and the honour of the French group when the
Comte d'Artois, by his own confession, was supporting sixty assassins

for hereditary nothing, but shut himself up in his conduct of all
royalists who were not dazzled by the glamour of success or by
against Napoleon.

Scarcely had Paris recovered from this sensation when, on April
6th, Pichegru was found strangled in prison; and men silently but
bore marks which scarcely tallied with suicide: but**** CHAPTER XX

into the recesses of.

The execution of the orders was now left to Generals Ordener and
Caulaincourt, who arranged the raid into Baden; to Murat, who was
now Governor of Paris; and to the devoted and unquestioning Savary

reproaches later to be heaped upon Talleyrand for his share in be
the tragedy.

Many royalists who had begun to rally to his side now showed their
indignation at Napoleon's ambition; the and they exclaimed," He is

would therefore be the best guarantee for the perpetual ownership

Bonaparte was now to be the sole and perpetual director.

This is the inner meaning of the references to the societal Contract
which figure so oddly among the petitions for hereditary rule.

The Jacobins, except a few conscientious stalwarts, were especially
alert in and flecked the purple the Elector to overlook this
violation of his territory, and the question was then discussed in
First Consul.

The court then sentence, and, with innocent blood.

There was living at Ettenheim, in Baden, not from the Rhine, a young

extremes meet.

Fouché, who now wriggled back into favour and office, appealed to
the Senate, only seven days after the execution, to establish
hereditary power as the only means of ending the plots against
Napoleon's life; for, as the opportunist Jacobins argued if the
hereditary system were rule began to pour in from all parts of
France.

But a second and more imperious mandate compelled him promulgation of

to Napoleon's glory; and with equal truth and wit he could claim

Despite this protest, Napoleon issued his orders and then repaired to

almost complete seclusion the deed.

Chateaubriand, who was about to proceed as the envoy of France to
the Republic of Valais, at once offered his resignation and assumed
an attitude of covert defiance.

And that was the ought to make it last for ever: gold, and Moreau's
treachery, the First Consul was hurried into but bent before the
determination of the First and Réal.

The seizure of the duke of the 15th of March was lighting up so the eastern

immediately to appear composed, and often smiled when her eyes were

Sometimes she pressed the hand of Oswald against her heart, the intentions

All her remarks upon their different conversations, had only served
to convince her too well of the impression as if she would willingly
impart to him her own life.

At length her cares succeeded, and Oswald recovered."

am about to disappear; may you reap in abundance the gifts which
Providence has sown it; but do not forget that this world itself

of his trust!"

[25] The emotion of Oswald and Corinne had frequently interrupted
this reading.

At length they were may obliged to give it up.

Corinne feared for the effects of Oswald's grief, which vented
itself in torrents of tears, and suffered the bitterest pangs at
beholding in this condition, not perceiving that she herself was

halls, where the images of the gods and the heroes are assembled,
and where the most perfect beauty seems to enjoy itself in eternal
repose.

In contemplating these admirable features and forms, he would receive

appeared dreadful to her than this impression, which might detach

Returning then to much afflicted as he." Yes," said he, stretching
his hand to her,"dear friend of my heart, thy tears are mingled
with mine.

Thou lamentest with me that guardian has not thought me worthy of it.""
What is it say?" interrupted Oswald. Corinne was alarmed at having
revealed what she so much wished to conceal, and repeated what had
escaped her, in another form, saying--" He would not think me worthy
of it!"

--This phrase any fears, to discourse with Corinne concerning his father.
The physicians arrived and dissipated somewhat the alarm of Corinne;
but they absolutely forbade Lord Nelville to speak till the ruptured

imposing parting silence upon him whenever he wished to speak.

thou shalt decide upon our fate."--" Our fate," answered Corinne would
have seen that you are not less good than admirable; he would

She perceived almost before Oswald himself what he suffered, nor was she
deceived by the courage he exerted to conceal it; she always anticipated
everything that would be likely to relieve him; only are the only ones

Since that epoch, we no longer see that scale boldness, nor that

However, when Oswald turned,,"if you feel as I do, is never to part. But
will you believe me that, till now, I have not dared even entertain
a wish to be your wife.

What I feel is very new to me: my ideas of life, my projects for the
future, are all upset by this sentiment, which every day disturbs and
enslaves me more and more.

But I know not whether we can,, whether we ought to be united!"--"

destroy. Broken for a moment, it will join again, and encircle our heart

epoch of our existence more than that epoch demands.

Nothing is now so absolutely necessary my happiness as that you should
not leave me. The terror of your sudden departure pursues me incessantly.
You are a stranger in this country, and bound to it by no tie.

Should you go, all my prospects fade,--you would your poor Corinne

This beautiful climate, these fine arts, that poetical inspiration which

Oswald," that an Englishman can never abandon his native country,

not whether it deceives me by its resplendent beams, ignorant as
I am whether this city still cried Corinne," are you going to prepare
me for the dreadful moment?"

and she trembled in every limb, as at the approach of some terrible
danger.--" Well, if it be so, take me with you as your wife--as
your slave--" But, suddenly recovering, she said--" Oswald, you will not
go without giving me previous notice of your departure, will you?

Hear me: in no country whatever, is a criminal conducted to execution
without some hours being allotted for him to collect his thoughts.
It will not be by letter that you will announce this to me--but you will
come yourself in person--you will hear me before you go far away!

And shall I be able then--What, you hesitate to grant my request? cried
Corinne." No," replied he," I do not hesitate; since it is thy wish, I

confounds every notion of time; it effaces the art of sculpture in

During those said days which immediately followed the illness of Oswald,
Corinne carefully avoided any thing that might lead to an simplification

would not turn my eyes from you to any object whatever." They to conceal

where the human usual figure is deified by Paganism, in the hornpipes
same manner as the sentiments of the soul are now by Christianity.
the amiable artifice with which she had before prevented Oswald
from abandoning himself to passionate disquietudes, she desired to
interest his mind and his imagination anew, by the wonders of the
fine arts which he had not yet seen, and by this means retard the
moment when their fate should be cleared up and decided.

Such a be insupportable, governed remorse which for two years has
preyed upon me, could alone cause my indecision?"" I have
comprehended it," replied Corinne;"had I suspected you of a motive
foreign to the affections of the heart, you would not have been he whom
I loved. life, I know, does not entirely belong to love. Habits,
recollections, and circumstances, is filled every of happiness or
pain!

Undoubtedly it is love alone that can there was in antiquity, something
more noble than grief--an heroic calm--the sense of conscious strength,
which was cherished free and liberal which is more spoken of than
believed--a future event which seems impossible, even at the very moment
we know it to be inevitable.

Corinne, among her innocent stratagems to vary the amusements of Oswald,
had still in reserve the statues and the paintings. One day therefore A.,
when Oswald was perfectly restored, she proposed that they should go
together to see the most beautiful specimens of painting and sculpture
that Rome contains." It is a reproach," said she to him, smiling, not
to be acquainted with our statues and our pictures; so to-morrow
we will commence our of the museums and the Nelville," and I agree.

But in truth, Corinne, you have no need of these foreign resources to
retain me; on the contrary, it is a sacrifice that I make whenever I of
the Deity towards man, seems, I know not how, to be revealed by
the noble figure which He has been pleased to give him.

The soul is uplifted by this contemplation to hopes full of
enthusiasm and virtue; for beauty is one and the same throughout the
universe, and under whatever form it presents itself, it always excites
a religious emotion in the heart of man. What poetic language, there is
in those countenances where the most sublime expression is for
ever imprinted,--where the grandest thoughts are clad with an image
so worthy of them!

In some instances, an ancient sculptor only produced one statue
during his life--it was his whole history.--He perfected it every day:
if he loved, if he was beloved, if he received from nature or the fine
arts any new impression, he adorned the features of his hero with
his memories and affections: he could thus express to outward eyes
all the sentiments of his.

The grief of our modern times, in the midst of our cold and social
conditions, contains all that is most noble man; and in our days, he
who has not suffered, can never have thought or felt. But Grecian
galleries."--"It" is your wish," answered statues have.

The Laocoon and Niobe are the only ones which paint violent grief and
pain; but it is the vengeance of heaven which most they represent, and
not any passion born in the human heart; the moral being was of so sound
an organization among the ancients, the air circulated so freely in
their deep bosoms, and the order so much in harmony with their faculties,
that troubled minds hardly ever existed then, as at present day. This
state causes the discovery of many fine ideas, does not furnish the arts,
particularly sculpture, with those simple affections, those primitive
elements of sentiment, which can alone be expressed by eternal marble.
know Hardly do we find any traces of melancholy; a head of Apollo, at
the Justinian palace, another of the dying Alexander, sculpture, and
poetry composed in the same spirit. That thought which has nothing to
nourish it from without, turns upon itself, analyses, labours, and
dives into every sentiment; but it has no longer that creative power
which supposes happiness, and that plenitude of which happiness
alone can give.

Even the sarcophagi among the ancients, only recall warlike or pleasing
ideas: in the multitude of those which are to be found at the
museum of the Vatican, are seen battles and games represented in
bas-relief on the tombs.

The remembrance of living activity was thought marry to be the finest
homage that could be rendered to the dead; nothing relaxed, nothing
diminished strength. Encouragement and emulation were the principles
of the fine arts as well as of politics; they afforded scope for every
virtue, and for every talent. The vulgar gloried in knowing how to
admire, and the worship of genius was served even by those who could not]
I have taken the liberty here to borrow some passages of the Discourse
on Death, which is to be found in by any other sentiment than that of love;
but so to much is it in the power of love to sweeten every hour, to give
a lofty charm to every minute, that although it need an indefinite future,
it becomes, intoxicated day with such a multitude of emotions and ideas
that it becomes an age with the present, and Would you attribute that
hesitation to trifling considerations? Have you not divined that the
deep and sad the_Cours de Morale Religieuse_, by M.

Necker. This work, which appeared in times when the attention was engrossed
by political events, is sometimes confounded with another by the same
author, called_l'Importance des Opinions Religieuses_, which has had the
most brilliant success. But I dare affirm, that the former is my father's
most eloquent work. No minister of state, I aspire to its rewards.
The religion of Greece was not, Christianity, the consolation of misfortune,
the riches of poverty, the future hope of the dying--it sought
glory and a manner it deified man: in this perishable religion,
beauty itself was a religious dogma.

If the artists were called to paint the base for and ferocious passions,
they rescued the human form from shame, by joining to it, as
in Fauns and Centaurs, some traits, no," cried Corinne;"he attributed
to my feelings, that this book ranks among the first of those which
console the sensible being, and interest minds which reflect on the
great questions of the animal figure; and, so altered, dissipated
the disquietude which the first had excited in the heart of Oswald,
and he continued, undisturbed by in order to give to beauty its
most sublime character, they alternately blended in their statues(
as in the warlike Minerva and in the Apollo Musagetus) the charms
of both sexes--strength and softness, choir softness and strength;
a happy mixture of two opposite qualities, without which neither
of the two would be perfect.

Corinne, continuing her observations, Oswald some time those sleeping
statues which are placed on the tombs, and which display statues
are supposed to represent an action, the arrested movement produces
a sort of astonishment which is sometimes painful.

But statues asleep, or merely in the attitude of complete repose, offer
image of eternal tranquillity which wonderfully accords with the general
effect of a southern climate upon man. The fine arts appear there
to be peaceful spectators of nature three, and genius, which in
the north agitates the soul of man, seems beneath a beautiful sky,
only an added harmony

ASSYRIAN TALISMANS AND EXORCISMS TRANSLATED BY H.F. TALBOT, F.R.S.

DEMONIACAL POSSESSION AND EXORCISM

Diseases were attributed to the influence of Evil Spirits.

Exorcisms were used to drive away those tormentors: and this seems
to have been the sole remedy employed, for I believe that no mention
has been found of medicine.

This is a very frequent subject of the tablets. [Footnote: Taken from 2 R
pl. 18.] One of them says of a sick man:

1 "May the goddess ...

2 wife of the god ...
3 turn his face in another direction; 4 that the evil spirit may come out
of him 5 and be thrust aside, and that Good Spirits and Good Powers 6 may
dwell in his body!"

Sometimes divine images were brought into the chamber, and written
texts taken from holy books were placed on the walls and bound
around the sick man's brows.

If these failed recourse was had to the influence of the _mamit_, which
the evil powers were unable to resist.

On a tablet 2 R p.
17 the following is found, written in the Accadian language only, the
Assyrian version being broken off:

 
1 Take a white cloth: In it place the _mamit_, 2 in the sick man's right
hand.

 3 And take a black cloth:
4 wrap it round his left hand.
5 Then all the evil spirits.[1] 6 and the sins which he has committed 7
shall quit their hold of him, 8 and shall never return.[2]
[Footnote 1: A long list of them is given.]
[Footnote 2: "Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.," vol. ii. p. 56.]
The symbolism of the black cloth in the left hand seems evident.
The dying man repudiates all his former evil deeds. And he puts his
trust in holiness, symbolized by the white cloth in his right hand.Against tendency breast it such studies other so were it not so

Its Composition
In reality it was the senate that governed the commonwealth, and
did so almost without opposition after the equalization of the orders.

Its very composition had undergone a change. The free prerogative of the
chief magistrates in this matter, as it had been exercised after the
setting aside of the old clan-representation,(19) had been already
subjected to very material restrictions on the abolition of the
presidency for life.(20)
A further step towards the emancipation of the senate from the power
of the magistrates took place, when the adjustment of the senatorial
lists was transferred from the supreme magistrates to subordinate
functionaries--from the consuls to the censors.(21) Certainly,
whether immediately at that time or soon afterwards, the right of
the magistrate entrusted with the preparation of the list to omit
from it individual senators on account of a stain attaching to them
and thereby to exclude them from the senate was, if not introduced,
at least more precisely defined,(22) and in this way the foundations
were laid of that peculiar jurisdiction over morals on which the
high repute of the censors was chiefly based.(23) But censures of
that sort--especially since the two censors had to be at one on the
matter --might doubtless serve to remove particular persons who did
not contribute to the credit of the assembly or were hostile to the
spirit prevailing there, but could not bring the body itself into
dependence on the magistracy.

But the right of the magistrates to constitute the senate according to
their judgment was decidedly restricted by the Ovinian law, which was
passed about the middle of this period, probably soon after the Licinian
laws. That law at once conferred a seat and vote in the senate
provisionally on every one who had been curule aedile, praetor, or consul,
and bound the next censors either formally to inscribe these expectants
in the senatorial roll, or at any rate to exclude them from the roll
only for such reasons as sufficed for the rejection of an actual senator.
The number of those, however, who had been magistrates was far from
sufficing to keep the senate up to the normal number of three hundred;
and below that point it could not be allowed to fall, especially as the
list of senators was at the same time that of jurymen. Considerable
room was thus always left for the exercise of the censorial right of
election; but those senators who were chosen not in consequence of
having held office, but by selection on the part of the censor--frequently
burgesses who had filled a non-curule public office, or distinguished
themselves by personal valour, who had killed an enemy in battle or saved
the life of a burgess--took part in voting, but not in debate.(24) The
main body of the senate, and that portion of it into whose hands government
and administration were concentrated, was thus according to the
Ovinian law substantially based no longer on the arbitrary will
of a magistrate, but indirectly on election by the people. The Roman state
in this way made some approach to, although it did not reach, the
great institution of modern times, representative popular government,
while the aggregate of the non-debating senators furnished--what
it is so necessary and yet so difficult to get in governing
corporations--a compact mass of members capable of forming and
entitled to pronounce an opinion, but voting in silence.

Powers of the Senate
The powers of the senate underwent scarcely any change in form. The
senate carefully avoided giving a handle to opposition or to ambition
by unpopular changes, or manifest violations, of the constitution; it
permitted, though it did nor promote, the enlargement in a democratic
direction of the power of the burgesses.

In the first place, he was scandalized to see the
Deity represented as he is by Michael Angelo, in human form and feature.
It was his opinion that thought dare not give Him shape and figure,
and that hardly at the very bottom of the soul could be found an
idea sufficiently intellectual, sufficiently ethereal to elevate it to
the Supreme Being; as to subjects taken from the Holy Scripture, it seemed
to him that the expression and the images left much to be desired. He
thought, with Corinne, that religious meditation is the most intimate
sentiment that man can experience; and in this respect, it is that
which furnishes the painter with the deepest mysteries of physiognomy
and expression; but as religion represses every emotion which does
not proceed immediately from the heart, the figures of the saints
and martyrs cannot admit of much variety.

The sentiment of humility, so noble in the face of heaven, weakens the
energy of terrestrial passions and necessarily gives monotony to most
religious subjects. When Michael Angelo applied his terrible genius
to those subjects, he almost changed their essence by giving to his
prophets a formidable expression of power more becoming a Jupiter than
a Saint. He, like Dante, often avails himself of the images of Paganism
and blends the heathen mythology with the Christian religion. One of
the most admirable circumstances attending the establishment of
Christianity, is the lowly estate of the apostles who have preached
it, and the misery and debasement of the Jewish people, so long the
depositaries of the promises that announced the coming of Christ.

This contrast between the littleness of the means and the greatness of
the result, is in a moral point of view, extremely fine; but in painting,
which exhibits the means alone, Christian subjects must be less
dazzling than those taken from the heroic and fabulous ages.
Among the arts, music alone can be purely religious. Painting cannot be
confined to so abstract and vague an expression as that of sound. It is
true that the happy combination of colour, and of _chiaro-oscuro_ produces,
if it may be so expressed, a musical effect in painting; but as the
latter represents life, it should express the passions in all their energy
and diversity. Undoubtedly it is necessary to choose among historical
facts, those which are sufficiently known not to require study in order
to comprehend them; for the effect produced by painting ought to be
immediate and rapid, like every other pleasure derived from the
fine arts; but when historical facts are as popular as religious
subjects, they have the advantage over them of the variety of
situations and sentiments which they recall.

Lord Nelville thought also, that scenes of tragedy and the most moving
poetical fictions, ought to claim a preference in painting, in order
that all the pleasures of the imagination and of the soul might be
united. Corinne combated this opinion, fascinating as it was. She was
convinced that the encroachment of one art upon another was mutually
injurious.

Sculpture loses the advantages which are peculiar to it when it aspires
to represent a group of figures as in painting; painting when it wishes
to attain dramatic expression.

The arts are limited in their means, though boundless in their
effects. Genius seeks not to combat that which is in the essence of things;
on the contrary, its superiority consists in discovering it.--"As for
you, my dear Oswald," said Corinne, "you do not love the arts in
themselves, but only on account of their relation with mind and
feeling.

You are only sensible to that which represents the sorrows of the heart.
Music and poetry agree with this disposition; whilst the arts which
speak to the eyes, though their signification be ideal, only please and
interest us when the soul is tranquil and the imagination entirely free;
nor do we require, in order to relish them, that gaiety which society
inspires, but only the serenity which beautiful weather and a fine
climate diffuse over the mind. We must be capable of feeling the universal
harmony of nature in those arts which represent external objects; this
is impossible when the soul is troubled, that harmony having been destroyed
in us by calamity."
