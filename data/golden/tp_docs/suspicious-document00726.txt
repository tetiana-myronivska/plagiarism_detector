§ 12. The reason, however, of not giving more expression to the
_Recitative_, in the manner of those called _Antients_, does not always
proceed from the Incapacity of the Master, or the Negligence of the

Now this publicity-loving nature was, we repeat, as much served by Art and
artists as by politicians; nay, perhaps more; and for this reason artists
stood high during the period of the Empire.

Talma held a social rank that under no other circumstances could
have been his, and a painter like Gérard could welcome to his house
statesmen such as Talleyrand or Daru, or marshals of France, and
princes even.However, before the Scholar arrives
at this, it will not be quite unnecessary to discourse with him in the
following Chapters, and if his Age permits him not to understand me,
those, who have the Care of him, may.

bold to say, that divers Professors do not even understand their own
Tongue, much less the _Latin_.[52]

§ 9. Let him not omit frequently to put forth, and to stop, the Voice,
that it may always be at his Command.

§ 10. As I rode along the pleasant way, watching eagerly for the object
of my journey, the rounded tops of the elms rose from time to time at the
road-side.

Wherever one looked taller and fuller than the rest, I asked myself,--"Is
this it?"

But as I drew nearer, they grew smaller,--or it proved, perhaps, that
two standing in a line had looked like one, and so deceived me. At last,
all at once, when I was not thinking of it,--I declare to you it makes
my flesh creep when I think of it now,--all at once I saw a great, green
cloud swelling in the horizon, so vast, so symmetrical, of such
Olympian majesty and imperial supremacy among the lesser forest-growths,
that my heart stopped short, then jumped at my ribs as a hunter
springs at a five-barred gate, and I felt all through me, without
need of uttering the words,--"This is it!"

You will find this tree described, with many others, in the excellent
Report upon the Trees and Shrubs of Massachusetts. The author has given
my friend the Professor credit for some of his measurements, but
measured this tree himself, carefully.

It is a grand elm for size of trunk, spread of limbs, and muscular
development,--one of the first, perhaps the first, of the first class
of New England elms.

The largest actual girth I have ever found at five feet from the
ground is in the great elm lying a stone's throw or two north of the
main road (if my points of compass are right) in Springfield. But
this has much the appearance of having been formed by the union
of two trunks growing side by side.

The West-Springfield elm and one upon Northampton meadows belong also to
the first class of trees.

There is a noble old wreck of an elm at Hatfield, which used to spread
its claws out over a circumference of thirty-five feet or more before
they covered the foot of its bole up with earth. This is the American
elm most like an oak of any I have ever seen.

The Sheffield elm is equally remarkable for size and perfection of
form. I have seen nothing that comes near it in Berkshire County, and
few to compare with it anywhere. I am not sure that I remember any
other first-class elms in New England, but there may be many.

----What makes a first-class elm?--Why, size, in the first place, and
chiefly. Anything over twenty feet of clear girth, five feet above
the ground; and with a spread of branches a hundred feet across, may
claim that title, according to my scale. All of them, with the questionable
exception of the Springfield tree above referred to, stop, so far as
my experience goes, at about twenty-two or twenty-three feet of
girth and a hundred and twenty of spread.

Elms of the second class, generally ranging from fourteen to eighteen
feet, are comparatively common. The queen of them all is that glorious
tree near one of the churches in Springfield. Beautiful and stately she
is beyond all praise. The "great tree" on Boston Common comes in the
second rank, as does the one at Cohasset, which used to have, and
probably has still, a head as round as an apple-tree, and that at
Newburyport, with scores of others which might be mentioned. These
last two have perhaps been over-celebrated. Both, however, are pleasing
vegetables.

The poor old Pittsfield elm lives on its past reputation. A wig of false
leaves is indispensable to make it presentable.

[I don't doubt there may be some monster-elm or other, vegetating
green, but inglorious, in some remote New England village, which only
wants a sacred singer to make it celebrated.

Send us your measurements,--(certified by the postmaster, to avoid
possible imposition,)--circumference five feet from soil, length
of line from bough-end to bough-end, and we will see what can be
done for you.]
--I wish somebody would get us up the following work:--
SYLVA NOVANGLICA.Whoever studies, let him look for what is most excellent, and let
him look for it wherever it is, without troubling himself whether it be
in the Stile of fifteen or twenty Years ago, or in that of these Days;
for all Ages have their good and bad Productions. It is enough to find
out the best, and profit by them.

§ 21. Burke, an authority whom Mr. Choate will not call in question, has
said that the training of the bar tends to make the faculties acute,
but at the same time narrow. The study of jurisprudence may, no doubt,
enlarge the intellect; but the habit of mind induced by an indiscriminate
advocacy--which may be summoned to the defence of a Sidney to-day and
of a spoon-thief to-morrow--is rather that of the sophist than of the
philosophic reasoner. Not truth, but the questionable victory of the
moment, becomes naturally and inevitably the aim and end of all the
pleader's faculties.

For him the question is not what principle, but what interest of John
Doe, may be at stake. Such has been Mr. Choate's school as a reasoner.
As a politician, his experience has been limited.

The member of a party which rarely succeeded in winning, and never
in long retaining, the suffrages of the country, he for a time
occupied a seat in the Senate, but without justifying the expectations
of his friends.

So far, his history shows nothing that can give him the right to assume
so high and mighty a tone in speaking of his political opponents.

But in his scholarship he has a claim to be heard, and to be heard
respectfully. Here lies his real strength, and hence is derived the
inspiration of his better eloquence. The scholar enjoys more than the
privilege, without the curse, of the Wandering Jew. He can tread the
windy plain of Troy, he can listen to Demosthenes, can follow Dante
through Paradise, can await the rising of the curtain for the first
acting of Hamlet.

Mr. Choate's oration shows that he has drawn that full breath which is,
perhaps, possible only under a Grecian sky, and it is, in its better
parts, scholarly in the best sense of the word.[1] It shows that he has
read out-of-the-way books, like Bodinus "De Republicâ," and fresh
ones, like Gladstone's Homer,--that he can do justice, with Spinoza,
to Machiavelli,--and that in letters, at least, he has no narrow
prejudices.

Its sentences are full of scholarly allusion, and its language glitters
continually with pattins of bright gold from Shakspeare. We abhor that
profane vulgarity of our politics which denies to an antagonist the
merits which are justly his, because he may have been blinded to the truth
of our principles by the demerits which are justly ours,--which
hates the man because it hates his creed, and, instead of grappling
with his argument, seeks in the kitchen-drains of scandal for the
material to bespatter his reputation.

Let us say, then, honestly, what we honestly think,--the feeling, the
mastery and choice of language, the intellectual comprehensiveness of
glance, which can so order the many-columned aisle of a period,
that the eye, losing none of the crowded particulars, yet sees
through all, at the vista's end, the gleaming figure of thought to
enshrine which the costly fabric was reared,--all these qualities
of the orator demand and receive our sincere applause.

_Of_ Airs.


If whoever introduced the Custom of repeating the first Part of the
_Air_ (which is called _Da Capo_) did it out of a Motive to show the
Capacity of the Singer, in varying the Repetition, the Invention cannot
be blam'd by Lovers of Musick; though in respect of the Words it is
sometimes an Impropriety.[56]

§ 2. By the _Ancients_ beforementioned, _Airs_ were sung in three
different Manners; for the Theatre, the Stile was lively and various;
for the Chamber, delicate and finish'd; and for the Church, moving and
grave. This Difference, to very many _Moderns_, is quite unknown.

§ 3. A Singer is under the greatest Obligation to the Study of the
_Airs_; for by them he gains or loses his Reputation. To the acquiring
this valuable, Art, a few verbal Lessons cannot suffice; nor would it be
of any great Profit to the Scholar, to have a great Number of _Airs_, in
which a Thousand of the most exquisite Passages of different Sorts were
written down: For they would not serve for all Purposes, and there would
always be wanting that Spirit which accompanies extempore Performances,
and is preferable to all servile Imitations. The royal family paid the
expenses of her funeral, and Chateaubriand, accompanied by nearly every
celebrity of the literary world, followed on foot behind her coffin,
from the church to the burying-ground.

Madame d'Abrantès may be considered as the inventor, in France, of what
has since become so widely spread under the name of _les salons picaresques_,
and of what, at the present day, is famous under the appellation
of the _demi-monde_.

Her example has been followed by numberless imitators, and now, instead
of presuming (as was the habit formerly) that those only receive who
are rich enough to do so, it is constantly inquired, when any one
in Paris opens his or her house, whether he or she is ruined, and
whether the _soirées_ given are meant merely to throw dust into people's
eyes. The history of the tea-spoons--so singular at the moment of its
occurrence--has since been parodied a hundred times over, and sometimes
by mistresses of houses whose fortune was supposed to put them far
above all such expedients.

Madame d'Abrantès, we again say, was the founder of a _genre_ in Paris
society, and as such is well worth studying. The _genre_ is by no
means the most honorable, but it is one too frequently found now in the
social centres of the French capital for the essayist on Paris _salons_
to pass it over unnoticed.

The _salon_ of Mme. Récamier is one of a totally different order,
and the world-wide renown of which may make it interesting
to the reader of whatever country. As far as age was concerned,
Mme.

Récamier was the contemporary of Mme. d'Abrantès, of Gérard, nay,
almost of Mme. Lebrun; for the renown of her beauty dates from the time
of the French Revolution, and her early friendships associate her with
persons who even had time to die out under the first Empire; but
the _salon_ of Madame Récamier was among the exclusively modern
ones, and enjoyed all its lustre and its influence only after 1830.

The cause of this is obvious: the circumstance that attracted society to
Mme. Récamier's house was no other than the certainty of finding there
M. de Chateaubriand. He was the divinity of the temple, and the
votaries flocked around his shrine. Before 1830 the temple had
been elsewhere, and, until her death, Mme. la Duchesse de Duras was the
high-priestess of the sanctuary, where a few privileged mortals only
were admitted to bow down before the idol.

It is inconceivable how easy a certain degree of renown finds it
in Paris to establish one of these undisputed sovereignties, before which
the most important, highest, most considerable individualities abdicate
their own merit, and prostrate themselves in the dust. M. de Chateaubriand
in no way justified the kind of worship that was paid him, nor did
he even obtain it so long as he was in a way actively to justify it.

It was when he grew old and produced nothing, and was hourly more and
more rusted over by selfishness, churlishness, and an exorbitant adoration
of his own genius, that the society of his country fell down upon
its knees before him, and was ready to make any sacrifice to insure
to itself the honor of one of his smiles or one of his looks.

In this disposition, Madame Récamier speedily obtained a leading
influence over Paris society, and when it was notorious that from four
to six every day the "Divinity" would be visible in her _salons_,
her _salons_ became the place of pilgrimage for all Paris. As with those
of Mme. d'Abrantès, there was a certain mixture amongst the guests,
because, without that, the _notoriety_, which neither Chateaubriand
nor Mme.

Récamier disliked, would have been less easily secured; but the tone
of the _réunions_ was vastly different, and at the celebrated receptions
of the Abbaye aux Bois (where Mme. Récamier spent her last quarter of a
century) the somewhat austere deportment of the _siècle de Louis
XIV._ was in vogue. All the amusements were in their nature

This was, to a certain degree, an innovation
in regular French society; the French being most truly, as has
been said, the "Chinese of Europe," and liking nothing less than
the intermixture with themselves of anything foreign.
