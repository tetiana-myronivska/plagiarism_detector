peores:# _it is going to be give and take; and if you men persist in
doing as you like, it is right for us women to do the same; and it
remains to be seen who will make the worst of it_.

The feminine plural pronoun _las_ is often used in a general and
indefinite sense where the English would use 'it' or have no object
expressed; thus:
_donde las dan las toman_, would be more literally: _where they give
they take_. The same indefinite meaning is found in the feminine forms

to her own health, or with her attention to that of her husband; but it
appeared that all were quite necessary and according to his wishes,
and the London ones were usually for the sake of trying to detach his
daughter, Mrs. The greater relation of the_clientèle_ of the alienist
