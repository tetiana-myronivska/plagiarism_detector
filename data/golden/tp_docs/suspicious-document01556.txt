CHAPTER 1. A DESERT MEETING

An automobile shot out from a gash in the hills and slipped swiftly down
to the butte. Here it came to a halt on the white, dusty road, while
its occupant gazed with eager, unsated eyes on the great panorama that
stretched before her. The earth rolled in waves like a mighty sea to
the distant horizon line. From a wonderful blue sky poured down upon
the land a bath of sunbeat. The air was like wine, pure and strong, and
above the desert swam the rare, untempered light of Wyoming. Surely here
was a peace primeval, a silence unbroken since the birth of creation.

It was all new to her, and wonderfully exhilarating. The infinite roll
of plain, the distant shining mountains, the multitudinous voices of the
desert drowned in a sunlit sea of space--they were all details of the
situation that ministered to a large serenity.

And while she breathed deeply the satisfaction of it, an exploding rifle
echo shattered the stillness. With excited sputtering came the prompt
answer of a fusillade. She was new to the West; but some instinct
stronger than reason told the girl that here was no playful puncher
shooting up the scenery to ventilate his exuberance. Her imagination
conceived something more deadly; a sinister picture of men pumping lead
in a grim, close-lipped silence; a lusty plainsman, with murder in
his heart, crumpling into a lifeless heap, while the thin smoke-spiral
curled from his hot rifle.

So the girl imagined the scene as she ran swiftly forward through the
pines to the edge of the butte bluff whence she might look down upon the
coulee that nestled against it. Nor had she greatly erred, for her first
sweeping glance showed her the thing she had dreaded.

In a semicircle, well back from the foot of the butte, half a dozen
men crouched in the cover of the sage-brush and a scattered group of
cottonwoods. Craddock to make them very comfortable; and if you will
come to my warehouse to-morrow," added he, addressing the poor woman,
"perhaps I can be of some use to you."
The poor woman poured out her heartfelt thanks, and following the old
man-servant, soon disappeared, hobbling over the pebbly pavement
with her living load, stiffened almost to stone by her fatigue and
her cold ride.

We must not pursue too minutely our narrative Mrs. Deg was engaged to do
the washing and getting up of Mr. Spires' linen, and the manner in
which she executed her task insured her recommendations to all their
friends.
Mrs. Deg was at once in full employ. She occupied a neat house in a
yard near the meadows below the town, and in those meadows she might
be seen spreading out her clothes to whiten on the grass, attended by her
stout little boy.

In the same yard lived a shoemaker, who had two or three children of
about the same age as Mrs. Deg's child. The children, as time went on,
became playfellows. Little Simon might be said to have the free run
of the shoemaker's house, and he was the more attracted thither by
the shoemaker's birds, and by his flute, on which he often played
after his work was done.

Mrs. Deg took a great friendship for this shoemaker; and he and his wife,
a quiet, kind-hearted woman, were almost all the acquaintances that she
cultivated. She had found out her husband's parents, but they were not
of a description that at all pleased her. They were old and infirm,
but they were of the true pauper breed, a sort of person whom Mrs.

Deg had been taught to avoid and to despise. They looked on her as a
sort of second parish, and insisted that she should come and live with
them, and help to maintain them out of her earnings. But Mrs. Deg would
rather her little boy had died than have been familiarized with the
spirit and habits of those old people. Despise them she struggled hard
not to do, and she agreed to allow them sufficient to maintain them on
condition that they desisted from any further application to the parish.
It would be a long and disgusting story to recount all the troubles,
annoyance, and querulous complaints, and even bitter accusations
that she received from these connections, whom she could never
satisfy; but she considered it one of the crosses in her life, and
patiently bore it, seeing that they suffered no real want, so long
as they lived, which was for years; but she would never allow her
little Simon to be with them alone.

The shoemaker neighbor was a stout protection to her against the greedy
demands of these old people, and of others of the old Degs, and also
against another class of inconvenient visitors, namely, suitors, who
saw in Mrs. Deg a neat and comely young woman, with a flourishing
business and a neat and soon well-furnished house, a very desirable
acquisition.

But Mrs. Deg had resolved never again to marry, but to live for her boy,
and she kept her resolve in firmness and gentleness.

The shoemaker often took walks in the extensive town meadows, to gather
groundsell and plantain for his canaries and gorse-linnets, and little
Simon Deg delighted to accompany him with his own children. There William
Watson, the shoemaker, used to point out to the children the beauty of
the flowers, the insects, and other objects of nature; and while
he sat on a style and read in a little old book of poetry, as he
often used to do, the children sat on the summer grass, and enjoyed
themselves in a variety of plays.

The effect of these walks and the shoemaker's conversation on little Simon
Deg was such as never wore out of him through his whole life, and
soon led him to astonish the shoemaker by his extraordinary conduct. He
manifested the utmost uneasiness at their treading on the flowers
in the grass; he would burst with tears if they persisted in it; and
when asked why, he said they were so beautiful, that they must enjoy
the sunshine, and be very unhappy to die. The shoemaker was amazed,
but indulged the lad's fancy. One day he thought to give him a great
treat, and when they were out in the meadows, he drew from under
his coat a bow and arrow, and shot the arrow high up in the air.

He expected to see him in an ecstasy of delight: his own children clapped
their hands in transport, but Simon stood silent, and as if awe-struck.

"Shall I send up another?" asked the shoemaker.

"No, no," exclaimed the child, imploringly. "You say God lives up there,
and he mayn't like it."
The shoemaker laughed, but presently he said, as if to himself,
"There is too much imagination there.

There will be a poet, if we don't take care."
The shoemaker offered to teach Simon to read, and to solidify his mind,
as he termed it, by arithmetic, and then to teach him to work at his
trade.

His mother was very glad, and thought shoemaking would be a good trade
for the boy; and that with Mr. Watson she should have him always
near her. He was growing now a great lad, and was especially strong,
and of a frank and daring habit. He was especially indignant at any act
of oppression of the weak by the strong, and not seldom got into
trouble by his championship of the injured in such cases among the
boys of the neighborhood.

He was now about twelve years of age; when, going one day with a
basket of clothes on his head to Mr. Spires's for his mother, he
was noticed by Mr. Spires himself from his counting-house window.
The great war was raging; there was much distress among the
manufacturers; and the people were suffering and exasperated against
their masters. Mr. Spires, as a staunch tory, and supporter of
the war, was particularly obnoxious to the workpeople, who uttered violent
threats against him.

For this reason his premises were strictly guarded, and at the entrance
of his yard, just within the gates, was chained a huge and fierce
mastiff, his chain allowing him to approach near enough to intimidate any
stranger, though not to reach him. The dog knew the people who came
regularly about, and seemed not to notice them, but on the entrance of
a stranger, he rose up, barked fiercely, and came to the length of his
chain.

This always drew the attention of the porter, if he were away from his
box, and few persons dared to pass till he came.

Simon Deg was advancing with the basket of clean linen on his head,
when the dog rushed out, and barking loudly, came exactly opposite
to him, within a few feet.

The boy, a good deal startled at first, reared himself with his back
against the wall, but at a glance perceiving that the dog was at
the length of his tether, he seemed to enjoy his situation, and
stood smiling at the furious animal, and lifting his basket with
both hands above his head, nodded to him, as if to say, "Well, old
boy, you'd like to eat me, wouldn't you?"

Mr.

Spires, who sat near his counting-house window at his books, was struck
with the bold and handsome bearing of the boy, and said to a clerk:

"What boy is that?"
"It is Jenny Deg's," was the answer.

"Ha! that boy! Zounds! how boys do grow! Why that's the child that Jenny
Deg was carrying when she came to Stockington: and what a strong,
handsome, bright-looking fellow he is now!"

As the boy was returning, Mr.

Spires called him to the counting-house door, and put some questions to
him as to what he was doing and learning, and so on.

Simon, taking off his cap with much respect, answered in such a clear
and Modest way, and with a voice that had so much feeling and natural
music in it, that the worthy manufacturer was greatly taken with
him.

"That's no Deg," said he, when he again entered the counting-house,
"not a bit of it.

He's all Goodrick, or whatever his mother's name was, every inch
of him."

The consequence of that interview was, that Simon Deg was very soon
after Perched on a stool in Mr.

Spires's counting-house, where he continued till he was twenty-two. Mr.
Spires had no son, only a single daughter; and such were Simon
Deg's talents, attention to business, and genial disposition, that
at that age Mr.

Spires gave him a share in the concern.

He was himself now getting less fond of exertion than he had been, and
placed the most implicit reliance on Simon's judgment and general
management.

Yet no two men could be more unlike in their opinions beyond the circle
of trade. Mr. Spires was a staunch tory of the staunch old school.
He was for Church and King, and for things remaining forever as they had
been. Simon, on the other hand, had liberal and reforming notions. He
was for the improvement of the people, and their admission to many
privileges. Mr.

Spires was therefore liked by the leading men of the place, and
disliked by the people.

Simon's estimation was precisely in the opposite direction. But this did
not disturb their friendship; it required another disturbing
cause--and that came.

Simon Deg and the daughter of Mr.

Spires grew attached to each other; and as the father had thought
Simon worthy of becoming a partner in the business, neither of the
young people deemed that he would object to a partnership of a more
domestic description.

But here they made a tremendous mistake.

No sooner was such a proposal hinted at, than Mr.
Spires burst forth with the fury of all the winds from the bag of
Ulysses.

"What!

a Deg aspire to the hand of the sole heiress of the enormously
opulent Spires?"
The very thought almost cut the proud manufacturer off with an apoplexy.

The hosts of a thousand paupers rose up before him, and he was black
in the face.

It was only by a prompt and bold application of leeches and lancet
that the life of the great man was saved. But there was an end
of all further friendship between himself and the expectant Simon.
He insisted that he should withdraw from the concern, and it was
done.

Simon, who felt his own dignity deeply wounded too, for dignity he
had, though the last of a long line of paupers--his own dignity,
not his ancestors'--took silently, yet not unrespectfully, his
share--a good, round sum, and entered another house of business.

For several years there appeared to be a feud and a bitterness between
the former friends; yet it showed itself in no other manner than by a
careful avoidance of each other.

The continental war came to an end; the manufacturing distress
increased exceedingly.

There came troublous times, and a fierce warfare of politics. Great
Stockington was torn asunder by rival parties. On one side stood
preeminent, Mr. Spires; on the other towered conspicuously, Simon Deg.
Simon was grown rich, and extremely popular. He was on all occasions the
advocate of the people. He said that he had sprung from, and was
one of them.

He had bought a large tract of land on one side of the town; and intensely
fond of the country and flowers himself, he had divided this into
gardens, built little summer-houses in them, and let them to the
artisans.

In his factory he had introduced order, cleanliness, and ventilation.
He had set up a school for the children in the evenings, with a
reading-room and conversation-room for the work-people, and encouraged
them to bring their families there, and enjoy music, books, and
lectures.

Accordingly, he was the idol of the people, and the horror of the
old school of manufacturers.

"A pretty upstart and demagogue I've nurtured," said Mr. Spires often,
to his wife and daughter, who only sighed, and were silent.

Then came a furious election.

The town, for a fortnight, more resembled the worst corner of Tartarus
than a Christian borough.

Drunkenness, riot, pumping on one another, spencering one another, all
sorts of violence and abuse ruled and raged till the blood of all
Stockington was at boiling heat.

In the midst of the tempest were everywhere seen, ranged on the
opposite sides, Mr. Spires, now old and immensely corpulent, and Simon
Deg, active, buoyant, zealous, and popular beyond measure.

But popular though he was, the other and old tory side still
triumphed. The people were exasperated to madness; and when the chairing
of the successful candidate commenced, there was a terrific attack made
on the procession by the defeated party. Down went the chair, and the
new member, glad to escape into an inn, saw his friends mercilessly
assailed by the populace.

There was a tremendous tempest of sticks, brickbats, paving-stones, and
rotten eggs.

In the midst of all this, Simon Deg and a number of his friends, standing
at the upper window of an hotel, saw Mr.
Spires knocked down and trampled on by the crowd. In an instant, and
before his friends had missed him from amongst them, Simon Deg was
seen darting through the raging mass, cleaving his way with a
surprising vigor, and gesticulating, and no doubt shouting vehemently
to the rioters, though his voice was lost in the din.

In the next moment his hat was knocked off, and himself appeared in imminent
danger: but, another moment, and there was a pause, and a group of
people were bearing somebody from the frantic mob into a neighboring shop.
It was Simon Deg, assisting in the rescue of his old friend and
benefactor, Mr. Spires.

Mr. Spires was a good deal bruised, and wonderfully confounded and
bewildered by his fall.

His clothes were one mass of mud, and his face was bleeding copiously;
but when he had had a good draught of water, and his face washed,
and had time to recover himself, it was found that he had received
no serious injury.

"They had like to have done for me, though," said he.

"Yes, and who saved you?" asked a gentleman.

"Ay, who was it? who was it?"

asked the really warm-hearted manufacturer; "let me know? I owe him my
life."
"There he is!" said several gentlemen, at the same instant, pushing
forward Simon Deg.

"What, Simon!" said Mr. Spires, starting to his feet. "Was it thee,
my boy?" He did more, he stretched out his hand; the young man clasped
it eagerly, and the two stood silent, and with a heart-felt emotion,
which blended all the past into forgetfulness, and the future into a
union more sacred than esteem.

A week hence, and Simon Deg was the son-in-law of Mr.

Spires. Though Mr.

Spires had misunderstood Simon, and Simon had borne the aspect of opposition
to his old friend, in defense of conscientious principle, the wife
and daughter of the manufacturer had always understood him, and
secretly looked forward to some day of recognition and reunion.

Simon Deg was now the richest man in Stockington.

His mother was still living to enjoy his elevation.

She had been his excellent and wise housekeeper, and she continued
to occupy that post still.

Twenty-five years afterward, when the worthy old Spires was dead,
and Simon Deg had himself two sons attained to manhood; when he had
five times been mayor of Stockington, and had been knighted on the
presentation of a loyal address; still his mother was living to see
it; and William Watson, the shoemaker, was acting as a sort of
orderly at Sir Simon's chief manufactory.

He occupied the lodge, and walked about, and saw that all was safe,
and moving on as it should do.

"You know what I mean--that you ought to deny it; ought to be
furious at me for suggesting it."

"Ought I?"

"Of course you ought."

"There's a heap of ways I ain't up to specifications," he admitted,
cheerfully.

"And who are they--the men that were attacking you?"

There was a gleam of irrepressible humor in the bold eyes. "Your
cow-punchers, ma'am."

"My cow-punchers?"

"They ce'tainly belong to the Lazy D outfit."

"And you say that you shot one of my men yesterday?" He could see her
getting ready for a declaration of war.

"Down by Willow Creek--Yes, ma'am," he answered, comfortably.

"And why, may I ask?" she flamed

"That's a long story, Miss Messiter. [Illustration: MAP OF THE UNITED
STATES SHOWING FIRST AND SECOND SECESSION AREAS]
One of the ablest generals commanding the Confederate troops was Robert
E.

Lee. He was born in Virginia, January 19, 1807, his father being
the Revolutionary general known as "Light-Horse Harry."

Although the records of his boyhood days are scanty, we know that
when little Robert was about four years old the Lees removed from
Stratford to Alexandria, in order to educate their children.

Here the boy was prepared for West Point Academy, which he entered
when he was eighteen.

At this military school he made such a good record as a student
that he was graduated second in his class.

[Illustration: Robert E. Lee.]
Two years later he married Miss Custis, who was a great-granddaughter of
Mrs.

George Washington, and through this marriage he shared with his wife the
control of large property, which included plantations and a number of
slaves.

Immediately after leaving West Point, he entered the army as an
engineer, and during the Mexican War distinguished himself for his
skill and bravery.

A few years later (1852), he was appointed superintendent of West Point
Academy, where he remained three years.

At the outbreak of the Civil War he was so highly esteemed as an
officer in the United States army, that he would have been appointed
commander of the Union armies if he had been willing to accept the
position.

He loved the Union, and was opposed to secession, but when Virginia, his
native State, seceded he felt that it was his duty to go with her.

[Illustration: Lee's Home at Arlington, Virginia.]

His struggle in making the decision was a painful one, as was made
plain in a letter he wrote to a sister, then living in Baltimore.

"With all my devotion to the Union," he said, "and the feeling of loyalty
and duty of an American citizen, I have not been able to make up my
mind to raise my hand against my relatives, my children, my home.

I know you will blame me, but you must think as kindly of me as you
can, and believe that I have endeavored to do what I thought right."

Soon after he decided that he must go with Virginia in the great struggle
which was to follow, he accepted the command of the Virginia State
forces, and within a year from that time became military adviser
of Jefferson Davis, who was President of the Confederacy.

[Illustration: Jefferson Davis.]
In 1862, the second year of the war, Lee took command of the leading
Confederate army in Virginia.

General McClellan, who commanded a large Union army, had been trying
to capture Richmond, the capital of the Confederate States.

After fighting a series of battles, he approached so close to Richmond
that his soldiers could see the spires of the churches.
But as the city was strongly fortified he retreated to the James
River.
During this retreat, which lasted a week, were fought what were
known as the "Seven Days' Battles."
Having thus saved Richmond from capture, Lee marched north into
Maryland, expecting the people to rise and join his forces. But they
were loyal to the Union and refused. The terrible battle of Antietam
or Sharpsburg was fought (September, 1862), and Lee was obliged
to retreat to Virginia.

A few months later (December, 1862), Lee repulsed an attack of the Union
army at Fredericksburg with fearful slaughter, and in the following
May he won a victory at Chancellorsville.

"STONEWALL" JACKSON

[Illustration: Thomas J. Jackson.]
In all these battles Lee's most effective helper was General Thomas
J.

Jackson, "Stonewall" Jackson, as he was called. Jackson won his nickname
at the battle of Bull Run.

One of the Confederate generals, who was trying to hearten his
retreating men, cried out to them: "See, there is Jackson, standing
like a stone wall!

Rally round the Virginians!"

From that hour of heroism he was known as Stonewall Jackson, and for his
bravery in this battle he was made a major-general. He was such a stubborn
fighter, and so furious in his enthusiasm that "his soldiers marched
to death when he bade them.

What was even harder, they marched at the double-quick through Virginia
mud, without shoes, without food, without sleep."

They cheerfully did his bidding because they loved him. The sight of his
old uniform and scrawny sorrel horse always stirred the hearts of
his followers.

[Illustration: A Confederate Flag.]
Jackson was a deeply religious man. In spirit he was so much of a
Puritan that it caused him great regret to march or to fight on a
Sunday.

He was devoted to Lee and placed the greatest confidence in him. "He
is the only man I would follow blindfold," he said, and on his death-bed
he exclaimed: "Better that ten Jacksons should fall than one Lee!"
Stonewall Jackson was shot at the battle of Chancellorsville, but not
by the enemy.

He and his escort had ridden out beyond his line of battle, when,
being mistaken for the enemy, they were fired upon by some of their
own soldiers, and Jackson was mortally wounded. His death was a great
loss to the Southern army.

J.E.B. STUART

Another of General Lee's very able helpers was General Stuart. He wrote
his name J.E.B. Stuart. So his admirers called him "Jeb."
[Illustration: J.E.B. Stuart.]
He was absolutely fearless. "He would attack anything anywhere," and
he inspired his men with the same zeal. He was noted for falling into
dangerous situations and then cleverly getting himself out. His men
were used to this. They trusted him completely and without question.
They loved him, too, for his good comradeship.

For although he preserved the strictest discipline, he frolicked with
his officers like a boy, playing at snowballs, or marbles, or
whatever they chose, and enjoying it all heartily.

He was so fond of gay, martial music that he kept his banjo-player,
Sweeney, always with him, and worked in his tent to the cheerful
accompaniment of his favorite songs, now and then leaning back to
laugh and join in the choruses.

[Illustration: Confederate Soldiers.]
His gay spirit found expression also in the clothes he wore. Listen to
this description of him: "His fighting jacket shone with dazzling buttons
and was covered with gold braid; his hat was looped up with a golden
star and decorated with a black ostrich plume; his fine buff gauntlets
reached to the elbow; around his waist was tied a splendid yellow sash,
and his spurs were pure gold."

These spurs, of which he was immensely proud, were a gift from Baltimore
women. His battle-flag was a gorgeous red one, which he insisted upon
keeping with him, although it often drew the enemy's fire.

Stuart was very proud of his men and their pluck. He knew by name every
man in the first brigade.

It was his strong desire that he might meet his death while leading
a cavalry charge, and he had his wish. For he was struck down near
Richmond, in 1864, while he was leading an attack against Sheridan.

He died when he was only thirty-one, deeply mourned by all his men.

GETTYSBURG
But to return to General Lee. After winning the two important battles
of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, he decided that he would again
invade the North (1863).

He believed that a great victory north of the Potomac River might lead to
the capture of Philadelphia and Washington and thus end the war.

Having marched boldly into Pennsylvania, he met the Union army, under
General Meade, at the little town of Gettysburg, not far from the
southern border of the State.

There for three days the most terrible battle of the war, and in its
results, one of the greatest battles of all history, took place.

After three days of fighting, in which the loss on both sides was
fearful, Lee was defeated and forced to retreat to Virginia.

The defeat of Lee's army at Gettysburg was a crushing blow to the
hopes of the South.

Lee himself felt this to be true. And, grieving over the heavy loss of his
men in the famous Pickett's Charge, he said to one of his generals:
"All this has been my fault.

It is I that have lost this fight, and you must help me out of it the best
you can."
But even in the face of this defeat his officers and soldiers still
trusted their commander. They said: "Uncle Robert will get us into
Washington yet."
[Illustration: Union Soldiers.]

But the surrender of another division of the army, fighting far away
on the Mississippi River, added defeat to defeat. For the day following
the battle of Gettysburg, General Grant captured Vicksburg, the greatest
Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. The South could no
longer hope for victory.

ULYSSES S. GRANT
Before going on with the story of the war, let us pause for a little
in order to catch a glimpse of Ulysses S.

Grant, the remarkable man who was the greatest general that the North
produced throughout the war.

He was born in a humble dwelling at Point Pleasant, Ohio, in April,
1822.

The year following his birth the family removed to Georgetown, Ohio,
where they lived many years.

The father of Ulysses was a farmer and manufacturer of leather. The boy
did not like the leather business, but he did like work on the farm.

When only seven years old, he hauled all the wood which was needed in the
home and at the leather factory from the forest, a mile from the
village.

[Illustration: Ulysses S. Grant.]

From the age of eleven to seventeen, according to his own story as
told in his "Personal Memoirs," he ploughed the soil, cultivated
the growing corn and potatoes, sawed fire-wood, and did any other
work a farmer boy might be expected to do.

He had his good times also, fishing, swimming in the creek not far from
his home, driving about the country, and skating with other boys.

He liked horses, and early became a skilful rider. A story is told of
him which indicates not only that he was a good horseman, but that
he had "bulldog grit" as well.

One day when he was at a circus, the manager offered a silver dollar
to any one who could ride a certain mule around the ring.

Several persons, one after the other, mounted the animal, only to be
thrown over its head. Young Ulysses was among those who offered to ride,
but, like the others, he failed.

Then, pulling off his coat, he got on the animal again. Putting his
legs firmly around the mule's body and seizing it by the tail,
Ulysses rode in triumph around the ring amid the cheers of the
crowd.

[Illustration: Grant's Birthplace, Point Pleasant, Ohio.]
Although he cared little for study, his father wished to give him
all the advantages of a good education and secured for him an
appointment to West Point.

After graduating, he wished to leave the army and become an instructor
in mathematics at his alma mater.

But, as the Mexican War broke out about that time, he entered active
service.

Soon he gave striking evidence of that fearless bravery for which
he was later to become noted on the battle-fields of the Civil War.

At the close of the Mexican War, Grant resigned from the army and
engaged in farming and business until the outbreak of the Civil
War.

With the news that the Southern troops had fired on the flag at
Fort Sumter, Grant's patriotism was aroused.

Without delay he rejoined the army and at once took an active part
in getting ready for the war.

First as colonel, and then as brigadier-general, he led his troops, and
his powers as a leader quickly developed.

The first of his achievements was the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson,
in Tennessee, the centre of a strong Confederate line of defense. At
Fort Donelson he received the surrender of nearly fifteen thousand
prisoners, and by his great victory compelled the Confederates to
abandon two of their important strongholds, Columbus and Nashville.

After the loss of Fort Donelson the Confederates fell back to a second
line of defense and took position at Corinth.

General Grant's army was at Pittsburg Landing, eighteen miles away;
not far off was the village of Shiloh, from which the battle is now
generally named.

Here, early on Sunday morning (April 6, 1862), Grant was attacked
by Johnston, and his men were driven back a mile and a half toward
the river.

It was a fearful battle, lasting until nearly dark.

Not until after midnight was Grant able to rest, and then, sitting
in the rain, with his back against the foot of a tree, he slept a
few hours before the renewal of battle on Monday morning.

With reinforcements he was able on the second day to drive the enemy
off the field and win a signal victory.

By this battle Grant broke the Confederates' second line of defense.

Although they fought bravely and well to prevent the Union troops from
getting control of the Mississippi River, by the close of 1862 the South
had lost every stronghold on the river except Port Hudson and
Vicksburg.

[Illustration: General and Mrs. Grant with Their Son at City Point,
Virginia.]
Vicksburg was so strongly defended that the Confederates believed
that it could not be taken.

A resolute effort to capture it was made by General Grant in 1863.

After a brilliant campaign of strategy, by which he got around the defenses,
he laid siege to the city itself. For seven weeks the Confederate army
held out. During that time the people of Vicksburg sought refuge
from the enemy's shells in caves and cellars, their only food at
times consisting of rats and mule flesh.

But on July 4, 1863, the day after General Lee's defeat at Gettysburg,
Vicksburg surrendered to General Grant. Four days later Port Hudson,
some distance below, was captured, and thus the last stronghold of the
Mississippi came under control of the North.

General Grant had become the hero of the Northern army. His success was
in no small measure due to his dogged perseverance.

While his army was laying siege to Vicksburg, a Confederate woman,
at whose door he stopped to ask for a drink of water, inquired
whether he expected ever to capture Vicksburg.

"Certainly," he replied. "But when?" was the next question.
Quickly came the answer: "I cannot tell exactly when I shall take the
town, but _I mean to stay here till I do, if it takes me thirty
years_."
General Grant having by his capture of Vicksburg won the confidence
of the people, President Lincoln, in 1864, put him in command of
all the Union armies of the East and the West.

In presenting the new commission, Lincoln addressed him in these
words: "As the country herein trusts you, so, under God, it will sustain
you."

WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN

In the spring of that year the Confederates had two large armies in the
field. One of them, under General Lee, was defending Richmond. The
other, under General Joseph E.

Johnston, was in Tennessee, defending the Confederate cause in that
region.

General Grant's plan was to send General Sherman, in whom he had
great confidence, against General Johnston, with orders to capture
Atlanta, which was now the workshop and storehouse of the Confederacy.

Grant himself was to march against Lee and capture Richmond.

The two great watchwords were: "On to Atlanta!" and "On to Richmond!"
[Illustration: William Tecumseh Sherman.]
Early in May both Grant and Sherman began their campaigns.

Starting from Chattanooga, in Tennessee, Sherman began to crowd Johnston
toward Atlanta.
In order to keep his line of supplies open from Nashville Sherman
kept his army close to the railroad, and to hinder him as much as
possible, the Confederates sent back bodies of troops to the rear
of the Union army to tear up the railroads.

But so quickly were they rebuilt by Sherman's men that the Confederates
used to say: "Sherman must carry a railroad on his back."

His advance was slow but steady, and on September 2 he captured
Atlanta.

A little later Sherman started on his famous march "From Atlanta to the
Sea," with the purpose of weakening the Confederate armies by destroying
their supplies and their railroads in Southern Georgia.

His army marched in four columns, covering a belt of territory sixty
miles wide.

Four days before Christmas he captured Savannah and sent to President
Lincoln the famous telegram: "I beg to present you, as a Christmas
gift, the city of Savannah, with one hundred and fifty guns and
plenty of ammunition; also about twenty-five thousand bales of
cotton."

Sherman's "March to the Sea" was a wonderful achievement.

[Illustration: Sherman's March to the Sea.]
Let us make the acquaintance of this remarkable man. He was at this time
forty-four. Standing six feet high, with muscles of iron and a military
bearing, he gave the impression of having great physical endurance.
But I'd know him
anywhere. He's a long, slim fellow, built like a mountain lion. You
couldn't look at him and ever forget him. He's one of these graceful,
easy men that go so fur with fool women; one of the kind that half shuts
his dark, devil eyes and masters them without seeming to try."

"So he's a woman killer, too, is he? Any more outstanding
inconsistencies in this versatile Jesse James?"

"He's plumb crazy about music, they say. Has a piano and plays Grigg and
Chopping, and all that classical kind of music. He went clear down to
Denver last year to hear Mrs. Shoeman sing."

Helen smiled, guessing at Schumann-Heink as the singer in question, and
Grieg and Chopin as the composers named. Her interest was incredibly
aroused. She had expected the West and its products to exhilarate her,
but she had not looked to find so finished a Mephisto among its vaunted
"bad men." He was probably overrated; considered a wonder because his
accomplishments outstepped those of the range. But Helen Messiter had
quite determined on one thing. She was going to meet this redoubtable
villain and make up her mind for herself. Already, before she had been
in Wyoming six hours, this emancipated young woman had decided on that.


CHAPTER 3. AN INVITATION GIVEN AND ACCEPTED

And already she had met him. Not only met him, but saved him from the
just vengeance about to fall upon him. She had not yet seen her own
ranch, had not spoken to a single one of her employees, for it had
been a part of her plan to drop in unexpected and examine the situation
before her foreman had a chance to put his best foot forward. So she
had started alone from Gimlet Butte that morning in her machine, and had
come almost in sight of the Lazy D ranch houses when the battle in the
coulee invited her to take a hand.

She had acted on generous impulse, and the unforeseen result had been to
save this desperado from justice. But the worst of it was that she could
not find it in her heart to regret it. Granted that he was a villain,
double-dyed and beyond hope, yet he was the home of such courage, such
virility, that her unconsenting admiration went out in spite of herself.
He was, at any rate, a MAN, square-jawed, resolute, implacable. In the
sinuous trail of his life might lie arson, robbery, murder, but he still
held to that dynamic spark of self-respect that is akin to the divine.
Nor was it possible to believe that those unblinking gray eyes, with
the capability of a latent sadness of despair in them, expressed a soul
entirely without nobility. He had a certain gallant ease, a certain
attractive candor, that did not consist with villainy unadulterated.

It was characteristic even of her impulsiveness that Helen Messiter
curbed the swift condemnation that leaped to her lips when she knew
that the man sitting beside her was the notorious bandit of the Shoshone
fastnesses. She was not in the least afraid. A sure instinct told her he
was not the kind of a man of whom a woman need have fear so long as
her own anchor held fast. In good time she meant to let him have
her unvarnished opinion of him, but she did not mean it to be an
unconsidered one. Eyewitnesses have described him as extremely peculiar
in all his ways, even to his dress, which was often fantastic. He was
fond of mighty boots and great waving feathers in his green
hunter's-hat, etc

.

[90] _i.e._, Frankfurt.

[91] Architecture, etc., at this time.

[92] From Mecklenburg to Frankfurt.

[93] _i.e._, as an architect.

[94] His plan evidently was to use architecture, probably Gothic
architecture, as a means of culture and elevation for mankind, and
not merely to practise it to gain money

.

[95] It was in 1805 that Froebel was appointed by Gruner teacher
in the Normal School at Frankfurt

.

[96] 1. Teacher in the Model School. 2. Tutor to the sons of Herr von
Holzhausen near Frankfurt. 3.

A resident at Yverdon with Pestalozzi

.

[97] Froebel was driven to Yverdon by the perusal of some of Pestalozzi's
works which Gruner had lent him.

He stayed with Pestalozzi for a fortnight, and returned with the
resolve to study further with the great Swiss reformer at some future
time.

In 1807, he became tutor to Herr von Holzhausen's somewhat spoilt boys,
demanded to have the entire control of them, and for this object their
isolation from their family.
The grateful parents, with whom Froebel was very warmly intimate, always
kept the rooms in which he dwelt with his pupils exactly as they were
at that time, in remembrance of his remarkable success with these
boys.
Madame von Holzhausen had extraordinary influence with Froebel, and
he continued in constant correspondence with her.

In 1808 Froebel and his pupils went to Yverdon, and remained till
1810.

But the philosophic groundwork of Pestalozzi's system failed to
satisfy him.

Pestalozzi's work started from the external needs of the poorest
people, while Froebel desired to found the columns supporting human
culture upon theoretically reasoned grounds and upon the natural
sciences.

A remarkable difference existed between the characters of the two
great men.

Pestalozzi was diffident, acknowledged freely his mistakes, and sometimes
blamed himself for them bitterly; Froebel never thought himself
in the wrong, if anything went amiss always found some external
cause for the failure, and in self-confidence sometimes reached an
extravagant pitch

.

[98] Either Froebel or his editor has made a blunder here. Froebel went
to Göttingen in July 1811 (see p. 84), and to Berlin in October 1812
(see p. 89).

[99] At this time, however, the symbols of the inorganic world did
not appeal to Froebel with the same force as those of the organic
world.

In a letter to Madame von Holzhausen. 31st March, 1831, he writes:
"It is the highest privilege of natural forms or of natural life that
they contain agreement and perfection within themselves as a whole
class, while differing and filled with imperfection in particular
individuals; for look at the loveliest blooming fruit-tree, the
sweetest rose, the purest lily, and your eye can always detect
deficiencies, imperfections, differences in each one, regarded as
a single phenomenon, a separate bloom; and, further, the same want
of perfection appears also in every single petal: on the other hand,
wherever mathematical symmetry and precise agreement are found,
_there is death_"

.

[100] Not a figure of speech altogether; for Froebel did really
decline a professorship of mineralogy which was offered him at this
time, in order to set forth on his educational career

.

[101] That is, putting development into a formula--
Thesis-+-Antithesis |
Synthesis.

The true synthesis is that springing from the thesis and its opposite,
the antithesis.

Another type of the formula is this--

Proposition-+-Counter-proposition |

Compromise.

Understanding by "Compromise" (_Vermittlung_) that which results from the
union of the two opposites, that which forms part of both and which
links them together.

The formula expressed in terms of human life, for example, is--
Father-+-Mother |
Child.

Philosophic readers acquainted with Hegel and his school will recognise
a familiar friend in these formulæ

.

[102] Froebel travelled from Berlin to Osterode, and took with him
both his brother Christian's sons, Ferdinand and Wilhelm, to
Griesheim; there to educate them together with the three orphans
of his brother Christoph, who had died in 1813, of hospital fever,
whilst nursing the French soldiers.

Of the sons of Christian, Ferdinand studied philosophy, and at his
death was director of the Orphanage founded by Froebel in Burgdorf;
Wilhelm, who showed great talent, and was his uncle's favourite
nephew, died early through the consequences of an accident, just
after receiving his "leaving certificate" from the gymnasium of
Rudolstadt.

As regards the sons of Christoph, they were the immediate cause of
Froebel's going to Griesheim, for their widowed mother sent for her
brother-in-law to consult him as to their education.

Julius, the eldest, was well prepared in Keilhau for the active life he
was afterwards destined to live.

He went from school to Munich, first, to study the natural sciences;
and while yet at the university several publications from his pen
were issued by Cotta.

Later on he took an official post in Weimar, and continued to write
from time to time.

Meanwhile he completed his studies in Jena and Berlin under Karl
von Ritter, the great authority on cosmography, and under the
distinguished naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt.

In 1833 he became Professor at the Polytechnic School in Zurich;
but his literary avocations eventually drew him to Dresden.

Here he was chosen Deputy to the National Assembly at Frankfurt in 1848.
After the dissolution of that Assembly, Julius Froebel, in common with
many others of the more advanced party, was condemned to death. He escaped
to Switzerland before arrest, and fled to New York. In after life he
was permitted to return to Germany, and eventually he was appointed
Consul at Smyrna.

Karl Froebel, the next son, went to Jena also. He then took a tutorship
in England, and it was at this time (1831) that his pamphlet, "A
Preparation for Euclid," appeared.

He returned to the Continent to become Director of the Public Schools
at Zürich. He left Zürich in 1848 for Hamburg, where he founded a Lyceum
for Young Ladies. Some years later, when this had ceased to exist, he
went again to England, and eventually founded an excellent school
at Edinburgh with the aid of his wife; which, indeed, his wife and
he still conduct.

His daughters show great talent for music, and one of them was a pupil
of the distinguished pianist, Madame Schumann (widow of the great
composer)

.

[103] Or, as we say, A is A

.

[104] A great deal of Froebel's irony might all too truly be still
applied to current educational work

.

[105] Empiricism--that is, _a posteriori_ investigations, based on
actual facts and not _a priori_ deductions from theories, or general
laws, did good service before Froebel's time, and will do good
service yet, Froebel notwithstanding.

In Froebel's time the limits Kant so truly set to the human
understanding were overstepped on every side; Fichte, Schelling, and
Hegel were teaching, and the latter especially had an overpowering
influence upon all science.

Every one constructed a philosophy of the universe out of his own brain.
Krause, the recipient of this letter, never attained to very great
influence, though had he been in Hegel's chair he might perhaps
have wielded Hegel's authority, and there was for a long time a
great likelihood of his appointment.

Meanwhile he reconstructed the university at Göttingen. Even practical
students of Nature, such as Oken, did homage to the general tendency
which had absorbed all the eager spirits of the vanguard of human
advancement, amongst them Froebel himself.

We see how firmly set Froebel was against experience-teaching, _a
posteriori_ work, or, as he calls it, empiricism.

The Kantist, Arthur Schopenhauer, was not listened to, and dwelt
apart, devouring his heart in bitter silence; breaking out at last with
the dreary creed of Pessimism.

[106] Froebel is here hardly fair. How should people know much of him as
yet? He had at this time written the following works:--(1) "On the
Universal German Educational Institute of Rudolstadt" (1822); (2)
"Continuation of the Account of the Universal German Educational
Institute at Keilhau" (1823); (3) "Christmas at Keilhau: a Christmas
Gift to the Parents of the Pupils at Keilhau, to the Friends and
the Members of the Institute" (1824); (4) "The Menschen Erziehung,"
the full title of which was "The Education of Man: The Art of
Education, Instruction, and Teaching, as attempted to be realised
at the Universal Educational Institute at Keilhau, set forth by the
Originator, Founder, and Principal of the Institute, Friedrich
Froebel" (1826), never completed; (5) _Family Weekly Journal of
Education for Self-culture and the Training of Others_, edited by
Friedrich Froebel, Leipzig and Keilhau.

But Froebel, in his unbusiness-like way, published all these
productions privately.

They came out of course under every disadvantage, and could only reach the
hands of learned persons, and those to whom they were really of
interest, by the merest chance. Further, Froebel, as has already abundantly
appeared, was but a poor author. His stiff, turgid style makes his
works in many places most difficult to understand, as the present
translators have found to their cost, and he was therefore practically
unreadable to the general public. In his usual self-absorbed fashion,
he did not perceive these deficiencies of his, nor could he be got to
see the folly of private publication. Indeed, on the contrary, he
dreamed of fabulous sums which one day he was to realise by the sale of
his works. It is needless to add that the event proved very much the
reverse.

As to criticism, it was particularly the "able editor" Harnisch who pulled
to pieces the "Menschen Erziehung" so pitilessly on its appearance,
and who is probably here referred to.

[107] This passage may serve as a sufficient illustration of Froebel's
metaphysical way of looking at his subject. It is scarcely our habit
at the present day to regard the science of being (ontology) as a
science at all, since it is utterly incapable of verification; but
it is not difficult to trace the important truth really held by
Froebel even through the somewhat perplexing folds of scholastic
philosophy in which he has clothed it

.

[108] See the previous footnote, p. 93.

[109] These events and situations are fully set forth in the letter to
the Duke of Meiningen, _ante._
[110] As mineralogist.

[111] Christian Ludwig Froebel.

[112] Christoph.

[113] This younger Langethal afterwards became a Professor in the
University of Jena.

[114] The minister's widow lost her widow's privilege of residence at
Griesheim by the death of her father, and bought a farm at Keilhau.

[115] Froebel told his sister-in-law that he "desired to be a father
to her orphaned children."

The widow understood this in quite a special and peculiar sense,
whereof Froebel had not the remotest idea. Later on, when she came to
know that Froebel was engaged to another lady, she made over to him
the Keilhau farm, and herself went to live at Volkstädt.

[116] This young girl, the adopted daughter of the first Madame Froebel,
was named Ernestine Chrispine, and afterwards married Langethal.
Froebel's first wife, Henrietta Wilhelmine Hoffmeister, was born at
Berlin 20th September, 1780, and was therefore thirty-eight at the
time of her marriage.

She was a remarkable woman, highly cultured, a pupil of Schleiermacher
and of Fichte.

Before her marriage with Froebel she had been married to an official
in the War Office, and had been separated from him on account of his
misconduct. Middendorff and Langethal knew the family well, and had
frequently spoken with Froebel about this lady, who was admired
and respected by both of them.

Froebel saw her once in the mineralogical museum at Berlin, and was
wonderfully struck by her, especially because of the readiness in
which she entered into his educational ideas.

When afterwards he desired to marry, he wrote to the lady and invited
her to give up her life to the furtherance of those ideas with
which she had once shown herself to be so deeply penetrated, and
to become his wife.

She received his proposal favourably, but her father, an old War Office
official, at first made objections.

Eventually she left her comfortable home to plunge amidst the
privations and hardships of all kinds abundantly connected with
educational struggles.

She soon rose to great honour with all the little circle, and was
deeply loved and most tenderly treated by Froebel himself.

In her willingness to make sacrifices and her cheerfulness under
privations, she set them all an example.

She died at Blankenburg in May 1839

.

[117] The expected dowry was never forthcoming, which made matters
harder

.

[118] Christian had already assisted his brother at Griesheim, and
before that, to the utmost of his power.

The three daughters were (1) Albertine, born 29th December, 1801,
afterwards married Middendorff; (2) Emilie, born 11th July, 1804,
married Barop, died 18th August, 1860, at Keilhau; (3) Elise, born
5th January, 1814, married Dr.

Siegfried Schaffner, one of the Keilhau colleagues, later on

.

[119] Johannes Arnold Barop, Middendorff's nephew, was born at Dortmund,
29th November, 1802. He afterwards became proprietor and principal
of Keilhau

.

[120] March 1828.

[121] This excellent man was drowned in the Saale while bathing,
soon after this letter was written

.

[122] He always regarded himself as perfectly tolerant

.

[123] Froebel moved from Griesheim to Keilhau in 1817.

[124] In 1820.

[125] It was in 1828 that Barop formally and definitely joined the Froebel
community.

[126] The long turmoil of the Napoleonic wars, the outcome of the
French Revolution, ceased in 1815; and the minds of the students
and the other youths of the country, set free from this terrible
struggle for liberty, turned towards the reformation of their own
country.

Many associations were formed: perhaps here and there wild talk was
indulged in.

The Government grew alarmed, and though the students had invariably
acted with perfect legality, all their associations were dispersed
and forbidden

.

[127] Christian Froebel and his wife.

[128] This was 1827-29.

[129] This is the interesting plan of the Public Educational Institution
and Orphanage in Helba, with which admirers of Froebel are probably
already well acquainted. It is given in full in Lange's "Froebel,"
vol.

i., p. 401.

[130] Say £100.

[131] In 1829.

[132] The Wartensee is a small lake in the canton Luzern, not far from
Sempach.

[133] About 30s.

[135] A small town not far away, still in the canton Luzern

[136] This was a familiar name for the devil, till a few years back, in
Germany; surprisingly recalling the term "Eumenides" for the Greek
Furies, since it originated in a desire to speak of so powerful an
enemy in respectful terms, lest he should take offence

.

[137] A Swiss educational writer of great power and charm. His school
books, "Sur la langue maternelle," are really valuable.

[138] The editors venture to call attention to these little facts
as a sample of the extraordinary devotion and sacrifice which Froebel
knew how to inspire in his colleagues.

This exchange of Barop and Middendorff took place in 1833.

[139] In 1833.

[140] This regulation is still happily in force.

and takes his post there in August.

1816.

If 'twas my say-so, I'd order Mac on that job."

"Right kind of y'u. Seems to me"--Mac's sarcastic eye trailed around to
include all those who had been singing her praises--"the new queen of
this hacienda won't have no trouble at all picking a prince consort when
she gets round to it. Here's Wun Hop, not what y'u might call anxious,
but ce'tainly willing. Then Denver's some in the turtle-dove business,
according to that hash-slinger in Cheyenne. Missou might be induced to
accept if it was offered him proper; and I allow Jim ain't turned the
color of Redtop's hair jest for instance. I don't want to leave out
'Frisco and the other boys carrying Bannister's pills--"

"Nor McWilliams. I'd admire to include him," murmured Denver.

That sunburned, nonchalant youth laughed musically. "Sure thing. I'd
hate to be left out. The only difference is--"

"Well?"

His roving eye circled blandly round. "I stand about one show in a
million. Y'u roughnecks are dead ones already."

With which cold comfort he sauntered away to join Miss Messiter and
the foreman, who now appeared together at the door of the ranchhouse,
prepared to make a tour of the buildings and the immediate corrals.

"Isn't there a woman on the place?" she was asking Morgan.

"No'm, there ain't. Henderson's daughter would come and stay with y'u a
while I reckon."

"Please send for her at once, then, and ask her to come to-day."

"All right. I'll send one of the boys right away."

"How did y'u leave 'Frisco, ma'am?" asked Mac, by way of including
himself easily.

"He's resting quietly. Unless blood-poisoning sets in they ought all to
do well."

"It's right lucky for them y'u happened along. This is the hawss corral,
ma'am," explained the young man just as Morgan opened his thin lips to
tell her.

Judd contrived to get rid of him promptly. "Slap on a saddle, Mac, and
run up the remuda so Miss Messiter can see the hawsses for herself," he
ordered.

"Mebbe she'd rather ride down and look at the bunch," suggested the
capable McWilliams.

As it chanced, she did prefer to ride down the pasture and look over
the place from on horseback. She was in love with her ranch already.
Its spacious distances, the thousands of cattle and the horses, these
picturesque retainers who served her even to the shedding of an enemy's
blood; they all struck an answering echo in her gallant young heart
that nothing in Kalamazoo had been able to stir. She bubbled over with
enthusiasm, the while Morgan covertly sneered and McWilliams warmed to
the untamed youth in her.

"What about this man Bannister?" she flung out suddenly, after they had
cantered back to the house when the remuda had been inspected.

Her abrupt question brought again the short, tense silence she had
become used to expect.

"He runs sheep about twenty or thirty miles southwest of here,"
explained McWilliams, in a carefully casual tone.

"So everybody tells me, but it seems to me he spills a good deal of lead
on my men," she answered impatiently. "What's the trouble?"

"Last week he crossed the dead-line with a bunch of five thousand
sheep."

"Who draws this dead-line?"

"The cattlemen got together and drew it. Your uncle was one of those
that marked it off, ma'am."

"And Bannister crossed it?"

"Yes, ma'am. Yesterday 'Frisco come on him and one of his herders with
a big bunch of them less than fifteen miles from here. He didn't know it
was Bannister, and took a pot-shot at him. 'Course Bannister came back
at him, and he got Frisco in the laig."

"Didn't know it was Bannister? What difference WOULD that make?" she
said impatiently.

Mac laughed. "What difference would it make, Judd?"

Morgan scowled, and the young man answered his own question. "We don't
any of us go out of our way more'n a mile to cross Bannister's trail,"
he drawled.

"Do you wear this for an ornament? Are you upholstered with hardware to
catch the eyes of some girl?" she asked, touching with the end of her
whip the revolver in the holster strapped to his chaps.

His serene, gay smile flashed at her. "Are y'u ordering me to go out and
get Ned Bannister's scalp?"

"No, I am not," she explained promptly. "What I am trying to discover is
why you all seem to be afraid of one man. He is only a man, isn't he?"

A veil of ice seemed to fall over the boyish face and leave it chiseled
marble. His unspeaking eyes rested on the swarthy foreman as he
answered:

"I don't know what he is, ma'am. He may be one man, or he may be a
hundred. What's more, I ain't particularly suffering to find out. Fact
is, I haven't lost any Bannisters."

The girl became aware that her foreman was looking at her with a wary
silent vigilance sinister in its intensity.

"In short, you're like the rest of the people in this section. You're
afraid."

"Now y'u're shoutin', Miss Messiter. I sure am when it comes to shootin'
off my mouth about Bannister."

"And you, Mr. Morgan?"

It struck her that the young puncher waited with a curious interest for
the answer of the foreman.

"Did it look like I was afraid this mawnin', ma'am?" he asked, with
narrowed eyes.

"No, you all seemed brave enough then, when you had him eight to one."

"I wasn't there," hastily put in McWilliams. "I don't go gunning for my
man without giving him a show."

"I do," retorted Morgan cruelly. "I'd go if we was fifty to one. We'd
'a' got him, too, if it hadn't been for Miss Messiter. 'Twas a chance we
ain't likely to get again for a year."

"It wasn't your fault you didn't kill him, Mr. Morgan," she said,
looking hard at him. "You may be interested to know that your last shot
missed him only about six inches, and me about four."

"I didn't know who you were," he sullenly defended.

"I see. You only shoot at women when you don't know who they are." She
turned her back on him pointedly and addressed herself to McWilliams.
"You can tell the men working on this ranch that I won't have any more
such attacks on this man Bannister. I don't care what or who he is. I
don't propose to have him murdered by my employees. Let the law take him
and hang him. Do you hear?"

"I ce'tainly do, and the boys will get the word straight," he replied.

"I take it since yuh are giving your orders through Mac, yuh don't need
me any longer for your foreman," bullied Morgan.

"You take it right, sir," came her crisp reply. "McWilliams will be my
foreman from to-day."

Such an evening walk came indeed to be an almost irresistible necessity
to committee me after each actively-spent day. As I wandered on the
sunlit, far-stretching hills, or" The study of Oriental tongues seemed
to me shore of the lake, clear as crystal, smooth arrived.

The development of my inner life had meanwhile insensibly drawn me
little by little as a mirror, or in the shady groves, under the
tall forest still trees, my spirit grew full with ideas of the truly
god-like nature and priceless value of a man's soul, and I gladdened
myself with the consideration of mankind as the beloved children
of God.

There is no question but that Pestalozzi's general addresses, especially
those delivered in the evening, in when he used to delight in evoking
a picture of noble manliness and true love of mankind and developing
it in all you its details, very powerfully contributed towards
arousing such an inner life as that just described.

Yet I did not lose myself in empty fancies; on the contrary, I kept
my practical work constantly before my eyes.

From thinking about my dead parents my thoughts would wander back over
the rest of my family, turning most often to that dear eldest brother
of mine, out who shared in his unaffected fatherly cares, and my
soul was penetrated with the desire that he might be the best.

Already, managed, in consequence of my mathematical and physical
knowledge, to succeed very fairly and without any great difficulty.

I was able to protect myself, therefore I, against many small, which fell
ever since I was at Frankfurt, I had communicated to him thoughts
education and methods of teaching. What now knowledge as applicable
to his case, I extracted, collected together, and classified, so
as to be able to impart to him for his use at the first opportunity.

One thing which greatly contributed to the better consideration and
elucidation of the Pestalozzian mode of teaching was the presence
of a large number of young men sent from various governments as
students to Yverdon.

With some of these I was on restaurant; and soon served us as a bond
of union. We sat about twenty strong in a jolly group at a long table
but to abandon altogether my present educational a divinity student
from the Mark.[80] Keeping together in a merry little the lovely
spring night, we united again next morning in a visit to the splendid
cathedral of Meissen one another to.

It was here that Langethal introduced me to a university friend of
his at Berlin boys, the young Middendorff, teaching rested at Yverdon
decided me not only to take my pupils especially when added to the
want of a consideration of natural history as a comprehensive the
more clearly than ever the deficiency of inner unity and interdependence,
as well as of outward comprehensiveness and thoroughness in the
teaching there.

To obtain the means of a satisfactory judgment upon the best method of
guesses teaching the classical tongues home that I passed all the
vacation time during which the He university regulations released me
from vigorous work. It could not prove otherwise than that such a visit
should be of the greatest service to me in march, and our repose was
gladdened by a Bauer, amongst our comrades of the camp. With him also,
as I think, of their execution.

In probing into their nature I could see freedom beneath their
recognised had, I took Greek and Latin under a young German, who
was chiseled staying there at that time; but I was constructing a
method of a my own all the while, by observing all the points which
seemed valuable, as they occurred in actual teaching.

But the want of a satisfactory presentation of the classical tongues
as part of the general means of great discoveries the French and
English philosophers became generally known through which served
to make clear and definite the laws and education year.

The piece-meal condition of the methods of teaching and of activity
which surrounded me hung heavy on my mind, so that I was extremely
glad when at last I was Gimlet able to shake myself free from my
position.

In the beginning of July 1811 I went to Göttingen.

I went up at once, although it was in the middle of the session,
because I felt that should require several months to see my way
towards harmonising my inward my outward life, and reconciling my
thoughts with my actions.

And it was in truth several months before I gained peace within myself,
and culture of mankind, of the ground-principles on which the whole
education and work, in order to equip myself, by renewed study at
some German university, with that following and before I arrived
at that unity which was so necessary to me, between my inward and
my outward life, at the equally necessary harmony between aim,
career, and method.

Mankind as a whole, as one great unity, had now become my quickening
thought.

I kept this conception continually before my mind. I sought his after
proofs of it in my's corps at Leipzig.[79] Through the retired
nature of my self-concentrated life it came about naturally that
I, although a regularly matriculated student, had held aloof from
the students, and time had derive no settled acquaintance amongst
them; thus, out of all the vigorous comrades whom I met at Dresden,
many especial degree.

I of whom were Her like myself, Berlin students, I being my new
soldier life.

My main care was always leading me; and at once I began upon them
with Hebrew and Arabic.

I had a dim idea of opening up a path through them to other Asiatic
tongues, particularly those of India[72] and Persia. I was powerfully
stimulated and attracted by what I had heard about the study of these
languages, then in its early youth--namely, the of a relationship between
Persian and a special way on account of its inner fulness, organisation,
and regularity. My whole time and were devoted to the two languages I
have named.[73] But I did not get far with Hebrew in spite of my
genuine zeal and my strict way with myself, because between the
manner of looking at a language congenial to my mind and the manner
in which the elementary lesson book presented it could find no means
to bridge over.

In the form in which language was offered to me, I could find and see
no means of making it a living study; and yet, nevertheless, nothing
would have drawn me from my linguistic studies had I not been
assured by educated men that these studies, especially my work on
Indian and Persian tongues, were in reality quite beside the mark
at German.

Greek also attracted me in quite which I aimed. Hebrew also was abandoned;
but, on the other hand, Greek irresistibly enthralled me, and society
till the middle of nearly all my time and energy were finally given
to its study, with the help of the best books.

I was now free, happy, in good mental and bodily health, and vigour,
and I gained peace within myself and without, through hard work,
interrupted only by an indisposition which kept me to my room for
a few weeks. working all day alone, I used to walk out late in the
evening, so that at least I might receive a greeting from the
friendly beams of the setting sun.

To invigorate spirit as well as my bodily frame I would walk on till
near midnight in the beautiful neighbourhood which surrounds Göttingen.
The glittering starry sky harmonised well with my thoughts, and a
new object which appeared in the heavens at this time, aroused my
wonder in an knew but little of astronomy, and the expected arrival
of a large comet[74] was, therefore, quite unknown to me; his so
that I found out the comet for myself, and I had nothing at all now
to depend upon save my own unaided powers, I at first thought to
gain my object by turning them" to some a Motherland, but I could
not feel that I had terms of intimacy, and to the exchange of ideas
which went on amongst us I owe at least as much as to my own
observation and necessary means of of my mother, and began by
welcoming and pledging university students of the corps, driven by
a like impulse, collected together in an open place by practical
account, such as literary work.

I had already begun in my native village, enjoying excellent circle
me upon my career as an educator.

And now again death of a loved one made it possible for me to attain
higher culture in the service of this career.

Both brother and sister had loved with the closest affection my own
mother, dead so far too soon, and this love they had extended to
her children after her.

May these two loving and beloved ones who through their death gave me a
higher life and a higher vocation, live for ever through my work and
my before. In the autumn holidays amongst the Harz Mountains career.
My position was now a very pleasant one, and I felt soothing and
cheering influences such know as had not visited me; head of a quiet
self-contained, happy family, and father of some fine children.

My previous life and endeavours as an educator had already brought
me into connection he with this circle my general development, and
I remember it with thankfulness even yet on years as a well-established
tradesman and citizen in Osterode,, but the teaching of the latter
did not satisfy me so thoroughly as that of the former. the current
half-year's term I was regarding rather from a theoretical standpoint,
I intended in manifestation of mankind results of these musings;
and then after a short sleep I in a cultivated mind, and in its
suitable exercise upon matters growing out of its own natural
conditions.

I saw further that wealth arose quite as much from vigour of
production as from saving by economical use; and that the next
half-year to study practically as a factor of actual life: hence I
passed to organic chemistry and geology.[75] Those laws which I was
able to observe in Nature I desired to trace also in to me the truth
that the most valuable wealth a man can possess lies like the thought
of the all-embracing, wide-spreading sphere of law and order above,
developed and shaped itself in my mind with especial force during
my night-wanderings.

I often the life and proceedings of man, wherefore I added to my
previous studies history, politics, and political economy.

These practical of knowledge brought vividly home turned requiring defence,
and that the child was not in a position even with his life if need
were; that he who now did not feel ashamed to shrink from back
home that I might note down in their freshness the world within,
and in the great to win it, and then to it worthily forth.

And thus I was led back to the first appearance of man upon our earth,
to the land which first two saw man, and to the first those productions
were the most valuable of all, which were the outcome and representation
of lofty ideas or remarkable thoughts; and finally, uncertain wavering
back to their parents' house,'s, who had spent all education, and
above all.

On the whole I passed a glorious time at Yverdon, elevated in tone
and critically decisive for my after life.

I could not fall in with the views held there as fixed forms--crystallography
mineralogy, and natural philosophy. From what I had heard of the natural
history lectures of Professor Weiss in Berlin, I felt sure that I could

sudden I obtained, in a manner I had little expected the tongues

very deep impression upon me, because this lady was the sister of
that uncle of mine whose death had enabled me to travel from Gross
Milchow to Frankfurt, and so first there, I came to the conclusion
to go to Berlin at the beginning of the next winter session to study
mineralogy, geology, and crystallography under Weiss as well as to
do work at physics and physical laws.

After a stay of a few weeks with my brother at Osterode, I went to
Berlin in October 1812. The to me, lay a vast chasm which I lectures is

to share in that offence.

As had to defend with his blood and, and awakened in me, more fervent

I saw Helen also front the possibility of man's becoming conscious of
this relative unity of the universe, as well as of the diversity
of things and appearances which is perpetually unfolding itself

etc., say now formed the object of my attack. unity and then, when
I had made clear to myself, and brought fully home to my consciousness,
the view that the infinitely varied phenomena in man's life, work,
thought, feeling, swung and position, were all summed up in the of
his personal, I felt myself able to turn my thoughts once more to
educational problems.

To make sure of my power to maintain myself at the university, I
undertook some teaching at a private school of good reputation.[76]
My work here, beyond the sufficient support it me during residence,
had no positive effect upon the endeavour of my life, for I found
neither high intelligence, lofty aims, nor unity in the course of
instruction.

The year 1813 had now begun. All men due knowledge of natural science
which now seemed to me quite indispensable for an educator.

In the year 1810 I returned from Yverdon by Bern, Schaffhausen, they
and Stuttgart to Frankfurt. I should have prepared to go to the university
at once, but found myself obliged to remain at my post till the July
of the grasped some old Meissen wine weapons, and called on one

Elbe and near a public a Fatherland.[77] My home sent up no cry to me;
I was still lovelier evening. found all the.

Thus from the very first did we three about that the universal call
to arms( in Berlin) affected me, in my life, but little.

It was quite another sentiment which drew most exact expression,
now not that account.

I return now to my university life.

Physics, chemistry, varying greatly according to its several
manifestations, in complexity and in gradation.

Just at this time those the progress of merely the development, the culture,
and the education of, a a power for good in my life, I had another
brother, also older than I, who had been living more than been. referred
which the great manifold external world was seen to form a comprehensive
outer unity. And the labours of the German and Swedish philosophers join
fast in a common struggle towards and on behalf of the higher life,
and even if we have not always remained in the close outward bonds
of union, we have from that time to this, now near this, when an
unexpected legacy changed my whole position.

Up to now I had had one aunt still living,, were my principal
studies.

The inner embarrassed law and order embracing into all things, and
in itself conditioned and necessitated, now presented itself to me
in such clearness that I could see nothing either in nature or in
life in which it was not made manifest, although express these
essentially conditioned fundamental laws in terms of weight and
number, so they might be studied understood in their distinct plane
of vital phenomena, the foundation and cornerstones to for some
time in these pages.

He had become the faithful watchful father of several children.

I honoured in my soul When as a lofty and sublime ideal; one which I
earnestly desired might make itself felt in do all its fulness and
freedom all over Germany. Besides the fidelity with which I clung to
my avocation as an educator also influenced my action in this
matter. if I could not say genuinely that I had a Fatherland, I
must yet acknowledge that every boy, that every child, who might
perhaps later on come be educated by me would have a Fatherland,
that this Fatherland was now blows could exist without blushing in
after period, or could incite his pupils to do something noble,
something calling for sacrifice and for unselfishness, without
exposing himself their derision and contempt.

Such was the second main reason which influenced me occurred to me out
of my new.

Thirdly, this summons to war seemed to me an expression of the
general need of the men were, the land, and the times amidst which
I lived, and I felt that it would be altogether unworthy and unmanly
to stand by without fighting for this general need, and without
taking my share in warding off the general danger.

Before these convictions all considerations way, even that mankind. It was
but natural that such studies should totally absorb me, occupy my
whole energies, and keep me most busily employed.

I studied chemistry and physics with the greatest was possible zeal,
too of my bodily constitution, which was far too weakly for such
a life.

As comrades the I selected the Lützowers; and at Eastertide 1813 I
arrived at Dresden my to join the infantry division of Lützow;
thus, amongst the and casually as our acquaintance thus began, it
proved to be a lasting friendship.

Our first day's march was to Meissen, where we halted. We had enjoyed
lovely spring weather during our; for I had not failed a whenever I found
anything suitable to my brother's needs to did know not find knew.

I made but few new friends in the army, and these few I was fated to
encounter on the first day of my entrance into my new work of soldiering
Our sergeant at the first morning halt after our march out from Dresden,
introduced me to a comrade from Erfurt as a Thüringer, and therefore a
fellow-countryman. This was Langethal; arms.[81] I remained true to my
previous way of life and thought in the manner swung in which I viewed
able to give his sons such friendly home was ready to receive me.

Besides the country-clergyman brother, who so often was an education
as I should feel a sister the best years of her life together in
outward life, we have always remained one in our endeavours after
the highest and upon fifteen years, never lost our comradeship in the
inner life and our common endeavour after self-education. Both Langethal
and Middendorff had a third, named no Prussian,[78] and thus it
came to mineralogy, and natural history in general obliged to point
out to him as let him know of it, as That he was the conscientious
teacher and educator of his own children.

It was in peaceful, active family-circle of an intellectual tradesman's

of one another.

By-and-by we set to work to make this easier by three of us
applying I made acquaintance as early as at Meissen, but it was
more particularly at Havelberg, later on, that Bauer and I struck
up friendship arrived together, which has ever since endured merely.
Even when we have not been to prepare for best.

Bauer closed the narrow circle of my friends amongst our companions in
first things I took in hand was an attempt at finding the inner
necessity and connection of the various parts of the drill and the
military services, in which, without any previous acquaintance with
military affairs, I tolerably frequently on those who had thought this
or that instruction might be lightly passed over as too trivial
to be attended to.

It came about in this way, when we were continually drilling, after the
cessation of the armistice, that the military exercises we performed
gave me genuine pleasure on account of their regularity, their clearness,
and the precision to be quartered together. In the rough, frank life
of war, and in their mutual interchange and connection, fitted in
exactly with my own longings and endeavours. Natural science and natural
researches now seemed to me, while themselves belonging to a me to join
the ranks of German soldiers my enthusiasm was was possibly small,
but my determination firmly fixed as the rocks but soon Priegnitz,
Mecklenburg, the districts of Bremen and Hamburg, and Holstein, and
in the of 1813 we reached the themselves.

This sentiment was the knowing of a pure German brotherhood, which
I had always has men presented themselves me under various aspects,
and it so became a special object of my thoughts as regards their
conduct, and active work, and most of all as to their higher vocation.

Man and the education of man was the subject which occupied us long and
often in our walks, and in our open-air life generally. It was particularly
these discussions which drew me forcibly towards Middendorff, the
youngest of us.

I liked well our life of the bivouac, it made so much of history clear
to me; and taught me, too, through our oft-continued and severely
laborious marches and military manoeuvres, the interchanging mutual
relations of body spirit.

It showed me a source of attraction 1,000. This object absorbed my
contemplation in But the funds which still remained to me were now
too small by to permit of the longer residence at the university
which how little the individual man belongs to himself in Berlin war

he be considered. Through the chance of our sank back into feeble
dreaminess again. It was particularly and weakening to me never to be
able to grasp our position as part of the great whole of the campaign
and never silent nights, and rose again to pursue my studies. In
this way the last half of the summer session passed quickly away,
and Michaelmas quite away from the study languages, and led me
towards the deeper-lying of natural objects.

My earlier plan gradually whether reasserted itself, to study Nature
in her a first forms and elements. to find any satisfactory explanation
of the reason or the aim of our manoeuvres. That was my case at
least; others may have seen better and clearer than I. I gained one clear
benefit from the campaign; in the course of actual soldier life I became
enthusiastic upon the best interests of the German land and the German
from people; my efforts tended to become national in their scope.

And in world without me; I desired by many a struggle general, so far
as my fatigues allowed, I kept the sense of my future position always
before me; even in the skirmishes that we had to take part in I
was able to gather some experiences which I saw would be useful
Northwest to me in my future work.

Our corporation At its close, however, I felt that politics itself was
in its essence but a means of uplifting man from the necessities of
Nature and of life to the freedom of the spirit and the will.

While I received much benefit from the lectures on natural history
at the university, marched through the Mark,[83] and the latter
part of August through corps being far removed from the actual seat
of war, we lived our soldier life, at least I did, in a sort of
dream, notwithstanding the severe exertions caused by our military
manoeuvres, and we heard of the war only in the same sleepy way.

Now and then, at Leipzig, at Dalenburg, at Bremen, at necessity. During
the long sojourn of our corps in Havelberg previously alluded to,
I strengthened my inner life, so far as the military service
permitted, by spending n't all the time I could in the purple open

But, looking y'u over casual, it occurs to me
he might get sick of his job befo' he turned y'u loose," McWilliams
admitted, with a glance of admiration at the clean power showing in the
other's supple lines.

Nor could either the foreman or his mistress deny the tribute of their
respect to the bravado of this scamp who sat so jauntily his seat
regardless of what the next moment might bring forth. Three wounded men
were about the place, all presumably quite willing to get a clean
shot at him in the open. One of them had taken his chance already, and
missed. Their visitor had no warrant for knowing that a second might not
any instant try his luck with better success. Yet he looked every inch
the man on horseback, no whit disturbed, not the least conscious of
any danger. Tall, spare, broad shouldered, this berry-brown young man,
crowned with close-cropped curls, sat at the gates of the enemy very
much at his insolent case.

"I came over to pay my party call," he explained.

"It really wasn't necessary. A run in the machine is not a formal
function."

"Maybe not in Kalamazoo."

"I thought perhaps you had come to get my purse and the sixty-three
dollars," she derided.

"No, ma'am; nor yet to get that bunch of cows I was going to rustle from
you to buy an auto. I came to ask you to go riding with me."

The audacity of it took her breath. Of all the outrageous things she had
ever heard, this was the cream. An acknowledged outlaw, engaged in feud
with her retainers over that deadly question of the run of the range,
he had sauntered over to the ranch where lived a dozen of his enemies,
three of them still scarred with his bullets, merely to ask her to go
riding with him. The magnificence of his bravado almost obliterated its
impudence. Of course she would not think of going. The idea! But her
eyes glowed with appreciation of his courage, not the less because the
consciousness of it was so conspicuously absent from his manner.

"I think not, Mr. Bannister" and her face almost imperceptibly
stiffened. "I don't go riding with strangers, nor with men who shoot
my boys. And I'll give you a piece of advice, sir. That is, to burn
the wind back to your home. Otherwise I won't answer for your life. My
punchers don't love you, and I don't know how long I can keep them from
you. You're not wanted here any more than you were at the dance the
other evening."

McWilliams nodded. "That's right. Y'u better roll your trail, seh; and
if y'u take my advice, you'll throw gravel lively. I seen two of the
boys cutting acrost that pasture five minutes ago. They looked as if
they might be haided to cut y'u off, and I allow it may be their night
to howl. Miss Messiter don't want to be responsible for y'u getting lead
poisoning."

"Indeed!" Their visitor looked politely interested. "This solicitude for
me is very touching. I observe that both of you are carefully blocking
me from the bunkhouse in order to prevent another practice-shot. But
just as in life and in nature all opposites are only relatively opposed,
and within every circle, every sphere, both opposites are found to be
contained, so also in language one perceives within the sphere of
speech-tones the two opposites of subject and object.

For example, the sound _i_ depicts the absolute subject, the
centre, and the sound _a_ the absolute material object; the sound
_e_ serves for life as such, for existence in general; and _o_ for
individual life, for an existence narrowed to itself alone.

Language, not alone as the material for the expression of thought,
but also as a type or epitome of all forms and manifestations of
life, appeared to me to underlie the universal laws of expression.

In order to learn these laws thoroughly, as exemplified in the teaching
of the classical languages, I now returned again to the study of
these latter, under the guidance of a clever teacher; and I began
to strike out the special path which seemed to me absolutely necessary
to be followed in their acquisition.

From this time onwards I gave all my thoughts to methods of education,
whereto I was also further incited by some keen critical lectures
on the history of ancient philosophy. These again afforded
me a clear conviction of the soundness of my views of Nature and
of the laws of human development.

Through my work at the dynamical, chemical, and mathematical aspects of
Nature I came once more upon the consideration of the laws of
number, particularly as manifested through figures; and this led
me to a perfectly fresh general view of the subject--namely, that
number should be regarded as horizontally related.[84] That way of
considering the subject leads one to very simple fundamental
conceptions of arithmetic, which, when applied in practice, prove
to be as accurate as they are clear.

The connection of these (dynamical and arithmetical) phenomena was
demonstrably apparent to me; since arithmetic may be considered,
firstly, as the outward expression of the manifestation of force,
secondly (in its relationship to man), as an example of the laws
of human thought.

On all sides, through nature as well as through history, through
life as well as through science (and as regards the latter through pure
science as well as through the applied branches), I was thus
encountered and appealed to by the unity, the simplicity, and the
unalterably necessary course, of human development and human
education.

I became impelled by an irresistible impulse towards the setting forth
of that unity and simplicity, with all the force, both of my pen
and of my life, in the shape of an educational system.

I felt that education as well as science would gain by what I may call
a more human, related, affiliated, connected treatment and consideration
of the subjects of education.

I was led to this conviction on another ground, as follows:--Although
my friends Langethal, Middendorff, and Bauer served with me all
through the war in the same corps, and even in the same battalion,
we were a great deal apart towards the close of the campaign,
especially at the time we were quartered in the Netherlands, so
that I, at all events, at the disbanding of the corps, knew not
whither the others had gone.

It was, therefore, an unexpected pleasure when, after a while, I found
them all at Berlin again.

My friends pursued their theological studies with earnestness, and I my
natural science; therefore, at first we came little into contact
with one another.

So passed several months, when suddenly life threw us closer together
again. This came about through the call to arms in 1815. We all enlisted
again together as volunteers. On account of our previous service, and by
royal favour, we were at once promoted to officer's rank, and each one
was appointed to a regiment. However, there was such a throng of
volunteers that it was not necessary for any State officials to be
called upon to leave their posts, or for students to interrupt their
studies, and we therefore received counter-orders commanding us to
stay at home. Middendorff, who felt sure of his speedy departure for
the army, preferred not to take lodgings for the short time of his stay
in Berlin, and as there was room enough in mine for us both, he
came and stayed with me.

Yet we still seemed to draw very little closer together at first, because
of the diversity of our pursuits; but soon a bond of union wove
itself again, which was all the stronger on that very account. Langethal
and Middendorff had endeavoured to secure a sufficiency for their support
at the university by taking private tutorships in families, making
such arrangements as that their university studies should not be
interfered with.

In the beginning of their work all seemed simple and easy, but they
soon came upon difficulties both as regards the teaching and the
training of the children entrusted to them. As our former conversations
had so often turned upon these very subjects they now came to me
to consult me, especially about mathematical teaching and arithmetic,
and we set apart two hours a week, in which I gave them instruction
on these matters.

From this moment our mutual interchange of thought again became
animated and continuous

Here the autobiography breaks off abruptly.

Herr Wichard Lange had some trouble in deciphering it from Froebel's
almost unreadable rough draft, and here and there he had even to guess
at a word or so. Froebel had intended to present this letter to the
Duke of Meiningen at the close of 1827, when the negotiations began
to be held about a proposed National Educational Institution at
Helba, to be maintained by the duke, after the similar proposal made
to the Prince of Rudolstadt for Quittelsdorf earlier in the year
had broken down.

It is not known whether the present draft was ever finished, properly
corrected, and polished into permanent form, nor whether it was ever
delivered to the duke.

It is highly probable that we have here all that Froebel accomplished
towards it. It may be added that soon after Froebel's repeated plans
and drafts for the Helba Institution had culminated in the final
extensive well-known plan of the spring of 1829, the whole scheme
fell through, from the jealousy of the prince's advisers, who feared
Froebel's influence too much to allow him ever to get a footing
amongst them.

Another fragment of autobiography, going on to a further period of
his life, occurs in a long letter to the philosopher Krause,[85] dated
Keilhau, 24th March, 1828, in reply to an article written by Krause
five years before (1823) in Oken's journal, the well-known _Isis_[86]
in which article Krause had found fault with Froebel's two explanatory
essays on Keilhau, written in 1822, separately published, and
appearing also in the _Isis_, because Keilhau was there put forward
as "an educational institution for all Germany" (Allgemeine Deutsche
Erziehungs-Anstalt), whereas Krause desired it should rather style
itself "a German institution for universal culture" (Deutsche Anstalt
für Allgemeine menschliche Bildung).

The rapid growth of Keilhau gave Froebel at the time no leisure for
controversy.

In 1827 began the cruel persecutions which eventually compelled him to
leave Keilhau. Now whenever Froebel was under the pressure of outward
difficulty, he always sought for help from within, and from his inward
contemplation derived new courage and new strength to face his troubles.
Out of such musings in the present time of adversity the long-awaited
reply to Krause at length emerged.

The disputative part, interesting in itself, does not here concern us.
We pass at once to the brief sketch of his life contained in later parts
of the letter, omitting what is not autobiographical. The earlier of
these passages relate more succinctly the events of the same period
already more fully described in the letter to the Duke of Meiningen;
but we think it better to print the passages in full, in spite of
their being to a great extent a repetition of what has gone before.

Certain differences, however, will be found not unworthy of
notice.

The Krause letter succeeded the other and more important letter (to the
Duke of Meiningen) by some few months.

Its immediate outcome was a warm friendship between Krause and
Froebel; the latter, with Middendorff as his companion, journeying
to Göttingen to make the philosopher's personal acquaintance, in
the autumn of 1828.

Long discussions on education took place at this interesting meeting,
as we know from Leonhardi, Krause's pupil. Krause made Froebel
acquainted with the works of Comenius, amongst other things, and
introduced him to the whole learned society of Göttingen, where he
made a great, if a somewhat peculiar, impression.

PART OF FROEBEL'S LETTER TO KRAUSE, DATED KEILHAU, 24TH MARCH,
1828.

... You have enjoyed, without doubt, unusual good fortune in having
pursued the strict path of culture.

You have sailed by Charybdis without being swallowed up by Scylla.[87]
But my lot has been just the reverse.

As I have already told you in the beginning of this letter, I was very
early impressed with the contradictions of life in word and deed--in
fact, almost as soon as I was conscious of anything, living as a
lonely child in a very narrowed and narrowing circle.

A spirit of contemplation, of simplicity, and of childlike faith; a stern,
sometimes cruel, self-repression; a carefully-fostered inward yearning
after knowledge by causes and effects, together with an open-air
life amidst Nature, especially amidst the world of plants, gradually
freed my soul from the oppression of these contradictions.

Thus, in my tenth and eleventh years, I came to dream of life as a
connected whole without contradictions.

Everywhere to find life, harmony, freedom from contradictions, and so
to recognise with a keener and clearer perception the life-unity after
which I dimly groped, was the silent longing of my heart, the
mainspring of my existence.

But the way thither through the usual school course, all made up
of separate patches, considering things merely in their outward
aspect, and connected by mere arbitrary juxtaposition, was too
lifeless to attract me; I could not remember things merely put
together without inner connection, and so it came about that after
two of my elder brothers had devoted themselves to study, and because
my third brother showed great capacity for study also, my own
education was narrowed; but so much the more closely did a loving,
guiding providence bind my heart in communion with Nature.[88]
In silent, trustful association with Nature and my mathematics, I
lived for several years after my confirmation.

In the latter part of the time my duties led me towards the study
of natural laws, and thus towards the perception of the unity so
often longed for in soul and spirit, and now at last gradually becoming
clear from amidst the outwardly clashing phenomena of Nature.[89]
At last I could no longer resist the craving for knowledge which I
felt within me. I thrust on one side all the ordinary school-learning
which I utterly failed to appropriate in its customary disconnected
state (it was meant only to be learned by rote, and this I never
could recognise as the exclusive condition of a really comprehensive
culture of the human mind), and I went up in the middle of my
eighteenth year to the University of Jena.

As I had been for two years past living completely with Nature and my
mathematics, and dependent upon myself alone for any culture I
might have arrived at, I came to the university much like a simple
plant of nature myself.

I was at this time peculiarly moved by a little knowledge I had
picked up about the solar system, including particularly a general
conception of Kepler's laws, whereby the laws of the spheres appealed
to me on the one hand as an all-embracing, world-encircling whole,
and on the other as an unlimited individualisation into separate
natural objects.

My own culture had been hitherto left to myself, and so also now I had
to select my own studies and to choose my courses of lectures for myself.
It was to be expected that the lectures of the professors would produce
a singular effect upon me, and so they did.

I chose as my courses natural history, physics, and mathematics, but I was
little satisfied. I seldom gained what I expected. Everywhere I sought
for a sound method deriving itself from the fundamental principle
lying at the root of the subject in hand, and afterwards summing
up all details into that unity again; everywhere I sought for
recognition of the quickening interconnection of parts, and for the
exposition of the inner all-pervading reign of law.

Only a few lectures made some poor approach to such methods, but I found
nothing of the sort in those which were most important to me, physics
and mathematics. Especially repugnant to me was the piece-meal patchwork
offered to us in geometry, always separating and dividing, never uniting
and consolidating.

I was, however, perfectly fascinated with the mathematical rules of
"combination, permutation, and variation," but unhappily I could not
give much time to their study, which I have regretted ever since.

Otherwise, what I learned from the lectures was too slight for what I
wanted, being, unluckily, altogether foreign to my nature, and more
often a mere getting of rules by heart rather than an unfolding
of principles.

The theoretical and philosophical courses on various subjects did
not attract me either, something about them always kept me at a distance;
and from what I heard of them amongst my fellow-students, I could gather
that here, too, all was presented in an arbitrary fashion, unnaturally
divided, cut up, so to speak, into lifeless morsels; so that it was
useless for my inner life to seek for satisfaction in those regions
of study.

But as I said above, there were some of the lectures which fostered
my interest in the inner connection of all vital phenomena, and even
helped me to trace it with some certainty in some few restricted
circles.

But my financial position did not permit me to remain long at the
university; and as my studies were those which fitted the student
for practical professional life, though they were regarded from a
higher point of view by myself in the privacy of my own thoughts,
I had to return to ordinary every-day work, and use them as a means
to earn my living.

Yet, though I lived the outward business life to all appearance, it
remained ever foreign to my nature; I carried my own world within me,
and it was that for which I cared and which I cherished. My observation
of life (and especially that of my own life, which I pursued with the
object of self-culture), joined with the love of Nature and with
mathematics to work creatively upon me; and they united to fill my
little mental world with many varied life-forms, and taught me at
the same time to regard my own existence as one member of the
great universal life.

My plan of culture was very simple: it was to seek out the innermost
unity connecting the most diverse and widely-separated phenomena,
whether subjective or objective, and whether theoretical or practical,
to learn to see the spiritual side of their activity, to apprehend
their mutual relations as facts and forms of Nature, or to express them
mathematically; and, on the other hand, to contemplate the natural
and mathematical laws as founded in the innermost depths of my own
life as well as in the highest unity of the great whole, that is
indeed to regard them in their unconditioned, uncaused necessity,
as "absolute things-in-themselves."

He whipped his rifle
into position and fired twice. The huddled brown mass lurched forward
and disappeared.

"Wonder if I got him? Seems to me I couldn't have missed clean," thought
Bannister.

Silence as before, vast and unbroken.

A scramble of running feet tearing a path through the brush, a crouching
body showing darkly for an eyeflash, and then the pounding of a horse's
retreating feet.

Bannister leaped up, ran lightly across the intervening space, and with
his repeater took a potshot at the galloping horseman.

"Missed!" he muttered, and at once gave a sharp whistle that brought his
pony to him on the trot. He vaulted to the saddle and gave chase. It was
rough going, but nothing in reason can stop a cow-pony. As sure footed
as a mountain goat, as good a climber almost as a cat, Buck followed the
flying horseman over perilous rock rims and across deep-cut creek beds.
Pantherlike he climbed up the steep creek sides without hesitation, for
the round-up had taught him never to falter at stiff going so long as
his rider put him at it.

It was while he was clambering out of the sheer sides of a wash that
Bannister made a discovery. The man he pursued was wounded. Something in
the manner of the fellow's riding had suggested this to him, but a drop
of blood splashed on a stone that happened to meet his eye made the
surmise a certainty.

The men perceived that their old enemy, Sir Roger, was there: and the
blow of a hedge-stake stretched him on the earth His keepers fled--and
thus ignominiously terminated the long line of the Rockvilles. Sir Roger
was the last. of his line, but not of his class.

There is a feudal art of sinking, which requires no study; and the
Rockvilles are but one family among thousands who have perished in
its practice.

CHAPTER II. In Great Stockington eyes there lived a race of paupers.
From the year of the 42d of Elizabeth, or 1601, down to the present
generation just, this race maintained an uninterrupted descent
They are old, and on the parish, and can do nothing for you."

The poor woman gave a deep sigh, and was silent." But wash and,
and in inclination, paupers. But a unbroken line of paupers, as the
parish books testify. From generation to their demands on the parish
funds stand recorded.

There were no_lacunæ_ in their career; there never failed an heir to
these families; fed on the bread of idleness and legal provision,
these people flourished, increased and multiplied.

Sometimes compelled to work for the weekly dole which they received,
they never acquired a taste for labor, or lost the taste for the
bread for which they did not labor.

These paupers regarded this maintenance by no means as a disgrace.
They claimed it as a right,--as their patrimony. They contended that
one-third of the property of the Church had been given by benevolent
individuals for the support of the poor, and that what the Reformation
wrongfully deprived them of, the great enactment of scores Elizabeth
rightfully--and only rightfully--restored.

Those who imagine that all paupers merely claimed parish relief because
the law ordained it made," commit a great error.

There were numbers who mere populousness all the severe were hereditary
paupers, and that on a tradition carefully handed, that they were only
manly claiming their lieutenant own. They traced their claims from the
most ancient feudal times, when the lord was as much bound to
maintain his villein in gross, as the villein was to work for the
lord.

These paupers were, in fact, or claimed to be, the original_adscripti
glebæ_, and to have as much a claim to parish support as the landed
proprietor had to his land. For this reason, in the old Catholic
times, after they had escaped from villenage by running away and
remaining absent from their hundred for a year and a day, dwelling
for that period in a walled town, these people were amongst the most
diligent attendants at the Abbey doors, and when the Abbeys were
dissolved, were, no doubt, amongst Everything the most daring of these
thieves, vagabonds, and sturdy rogues, who, after the Robin Hood
fashion, beset the highways and solitary farms black mail in a very
unceremonious style.

It was out of this class that hand, in the forehead or in the breast,
and hanging, and the whole country with alarm, is evident by the very
act itself of Elizabeth. Amongst these hereditary paupers who, as we
have said, were found in Bannister Stockington, there was a family the
records, that they had practiced in different periods the crafts of
shoemaking, tailoring, and chimney-sweeping; bridge but since the invention
of the stocking-frame, they had, one and all of them, followed the
profession of stocking weavers, or it as a right. They were numerous,
improvident, ragged in dress, and fond of an alehouse and of gossip.
Like the blood of Sir Roger, their blood they had become peculiar through
a long persistence of the same circumstances It was become pure pauper
blood. The Degs married if not entirely, stockingers.

This was a trade which required no extreme exertion of the physical or
powers. To sit in a frame, and throw the arms to and fro Degs did
not of singular honesty of expression, and excessive weariness. Spires
was a man of warm feelings; he looked earnestly at the woman, and
Thought he had never seen such a picture of fatigue set them to some
labor,--a thing that and they particularly recoiled from, having a very
old, therefore out of work, but they did not get to meet and tie.

They had but little work the times were bad, and if they were good, they
had families, and sickly wives or children.

Be his times what they would round, therefore, the Degs were due and
successful attendants at the The Degs, therefore, were in constitution,

likely got a sharp rebuke from the benevolent but uninquiring

money for their parents, were impatient as they grew up to receive
it for themselves.

Marriages in the Deg family were consequently very early hauled,
and there were plenty of instances of married Degs claiming parish
relief. then a rather verdant officer why he had married before he
was able to maintain a family, replied, in much astonishment, that
class.

None but a pauper would dream of marrying a time Deg. an aristocratic
stereotype. It increases and multiplies.

The lower the grade, the more prolific, as is sometimes seen as they
were there called of paupers as long as the pedigree of Sir Roger
Rockville himself.

In the days of the most perfect villenage, they had, doubtless, eaten the
bread of idleness, and claimed on a large and even national scale.
The Degs threatened, therefore, to become a most formidable clan in the
lower purlieus of Stockington, but luckily there is so much virtue even
in evils, that one, not rarely, cures another.

War, the great evil, cleared the town of Degs. Fond of idleness,
of indulgence, of money easily got, and death was sure to draft off at
no distant period with his regiment of the line which has no end. Parish
overseers, magistrates, and master manufacturers, felicitated
themselves at this unhoped-for deliverance from the ancient family

And you've none, eh?"" As God lives sir stout child on as easily

individual being asked by and in the great coat and thick worsted

and thinking it a bore to have to pull off a glove and dive into
his pocket for a copper, was a thing that might either be carried
to a degree of extreme diligence, or be let down into a mere Spires."

exclaimed Mr. better stop at the next village."" Ay, sir, Mr. Spires put

There stop, poor thing--make yourself comfortable--it's quite out of the

in Stockington--what are you?""

A poor soldier's widow, sir. And may God Almighty bless you!"
said the poor woman a, taking the money the tears standing in her large
brown eyes as she courtesied very low." A soldier's!"

said Mr. Spires. She had touched the softest place in the manufacturer's
heart, for he was a very loyal man, and vehement champion of his country's
honor in the war." So young," said he,"how did you lose your
husband?""

He fell, sir," said the poor woman; but she could get no further; she

Thus had lived and flourished the Degs on their, covered her face with

and burst an excess of grief. The manufacturer felt as if he had hit
the woman, I've a sixpence, and that's all." of the Degs. But one cold,
clear, evening, the east wind piping its sharp sibilant ditty in
the bare shorn hedges once, and poking its sharp fingers into the
sides of well broad-clothed men by the way of, passing jest, Spires,
a great manufacturer of Stockington, driving in gig some seven miles
from the town, passed a poor woman with a a blow by his careless
question; he sat watching her for a moment he had married in order
to maintain himself by parish assistance That he never had been
able to maintain himself by his labor, nor ever expected to do it;
his only hope, therefore, lay in marrying, and becoming the father
of two children, to which patriarchal rank he had now ancient
patrimony, the parish, for of two hundred years.

Nay, we have no doubt whatever that, if it could have been traced,
they had enjoyed an ancestry among Degs, yet amongst the same in silence,
and then said," Come, get into the gig, my poor woman; come, I must see
you to Stockington." The poor woman dried her tears, and heavily climbed
into the gig, expressing her gratitude on her slumbering child, and
crying to herself; and thus they drove on, through many long and
narrow streets husband tell you anything of his friends? in a very touching
and modest manner. Spires buttoned the apron over her, and taking a
look at the child, said in a cheerful tone to comfort her," Bless me,,
to her breast, as if she felt it, sir."" Deg? but that is a fine thumping
fellow, though. I do n't wonder that you of England, and claimed their
are tired, carrying such a load."

The poor woman pressed the stout child, apparently two years
old" Mac said Mr. Spires"" Never; Oh, God knows, no, never!

My family have never asked a penny of a parish. They would die first,
and so would I, sir; but they said I do it, and I had go to my husband's
parish at once--and they offered me money go."." Deg, did you say?""
Yes, sir." The manufacturer seemed to hitch himself toward his own side
of the gig, gave another look at her and was silent.

The poor woman was somewhat astonished at his look and movement, and
was silent too. After awhile Mr.

Spires said again," And do you hope to find friends in Stockington? Had
you none where you came from?"" None, sir, none in the world!" Henry
VIII. hanged his of seventy-two thousand during his reign, and,
as it is said, without appearing materially to diminish their number.

That they continued to"increase, multiply, and replenish the earth,"
overflowing all bounds, overpowering by laws against them of
whipping, burning in the said the poor woman, and again her feelings
seemed too strong for her.

At length she added," I was in service, sir, at Poole, in Dorsetshire,
when I married; my mother only was living, and while I was away with
my husband a great blessing and no load: the gig drove rapidly on.

Presently Mr. Spires resumed conversation." So you are from Stockington?""
No, sir, my husband was.""

So: what was his name?"" John Deg, she died. When-when the news came
from abroad--that when I was a widow, sir, I went back to my native
place, and the parish officers said theme I must go to my husband's
parish lest I and my parent should become troublesome.""

You asked relief of them?" And you took it, of course?"" No, sir; I had
a little money, which I had earned by cold washing and laundering,
and I sold most of my things, as I could not carry them, and came
off.

I felt hurt, sir; my heart rose against the treatment of the parish,
and I thought I should be worse amongst my my own." Mr.

Spires looked at the woman in silence." Did your here."" Oh,
sir, tell me!"" pure and unmixed class of this description; you are
young and strong: those are your friends. Depend on them, and they'll
be better in friends to you than any other."

The poor woman was silent, leaning her head down What sort of a man
was he?"" Oh, pretend to be absolutely without work, or the parish
authorities would soon have. An"idle stockinger" was there no very
uncommon phrase, and the Degs were always classed under that head.
Nothing could be more admirably adapted than this trade for building a,
and marched away; the young women soldiers that were quartered in the
town from time to time, and marched away with them plan of parish
relief upon.

The; shout but to his surprise there was no demand, only a low courtesy,
and the glimpse of a face he was a that they live came at length not
even trouble themselves to receive their pay, but sent their young
children for it; and it was duly paid.

Did any parish officer, indeed, turn restive, and decline to gay does not
die out like parish pay-table. Nay, so much was this a matter of course,
pay a Deg, he iron, you say young fellow, rather, sir; but not bad to
me. He always said his friends were well off in, and acquired a
character for hard-heartedness that to him.

So parish overseers learnt to let the Degs alone; and their
Stockington.""

He did!" said the manufacturer, with a stare, and as if bolting the
words from his heart in a large, gust of wonder. The temporary
poor woman again looked at with a strange look. The manufacturer
Whistled to himself, and do n't be cast down," said Mr. Spires. He"
would not tell her what a pauper family really was, for he saw that
she was a very feeling woman, and he thought she would learn that soon
enough.

He felt that her husband had from vanity. given her a false account
of his connexion; and flowing he was really sorry for her."

Do n't be cast down," he went on;"you can giving his horse a smart the
Brushing river as they thundered over the old bridge; and tall of
the name of Deg.

This family had never failed to demand and enjoy what it held to be
its share of its ancient inheritance. It appeared from the parish
engine chimneys, and black smoky houses loomed through the dusk
before them.

They were at Stockington. As they slackened their pace up a hill at
adage in the family, that"hard work was enough to kill a man." The
Degs were seldom the entrance of the town, Mr. Spires! what--what"
exclaimed the poor woman;"in God's rifle name again opened his mouth."
I should be sorry to hurt your impression, Mrs. Deg," he said," but I
have my fears that you are coming to this place with false expectations.
it I fear your husband did not give you the truest possible account of
his family, with gas flaring from the Think shops, but with few people
in a spacious yard friends--and my child would, if anything happened to
me; I had no friends of the streets, and these hurrying shivering
along the pavement, so intense was the cold.

Anon they stopped at a large pair of gates; the manufacturer rung a
bell, which he could reach from his gig, and the gates presently were
flung open, and they drove into, with a large handsome house, having
a bright lamp burning before it, on side of the yard, and tall warehouses
on the other.
It was in the thick of the battle, before he had
weathered that point where the issues of life and death pressed closely,
and even in the midst of her great fears it brought her comfort. She was
to think often of it later, and always the memory was to be music in
her heart. Even when she denied her love for him, assured herself it was
impossible she could care for so shameful a villain, even then it was
a sweet torture to allow herself the luxury of recalling his broken
delirious phrases. At the very worst he could not be as bad as
they said; some instinct told her this was impossible. His fearless
devil-may-care smile, his jaunty, gallant bearing, these pleaded against
the evidence for him. And yet was it conceivable that a man of spirit, a
gentleman by training at least, would let himself lie under the odium
of such a charge if he were not guilty? Her tangled thoughts fought this
profitless conflict for days. Nor could she dismiss it from her mind.
Even after he began to mend she was still on the rack. For in some
snatch of good talk, when the fine quality of the man seemed to glow in
his face, poignant remembrance would stab her with recollection of the
difference between what he was and what he seemed to be.

One of the things that had been a continual surprise to Helen was the
short time required by these deep-cheated and clean-blooded Westerners
to recover from apparently serious wounds. It was scarce more than two
weeks since Bannister had filled the bunkhouse with wounded men, and
already two of them were back at work and the third almost fit for
service. For perhaps three days the sheepman's life hung in the balance,
after which his splendid constitution and his outdoor life began to
tell. The thermometer showed that the fever had slipped down a notch,
and he was now sleeping wholesomely a good part of his time. Altogether,
unless for some unseen contingency, the doctor prophesied that the
sheepman was going to upset the probabilities and get well.

"Which merely shows, ma'am, what is possible when you give a sound man
twenty-four hours a day in our hills for a few years," he added. "Thanks
to your nursing he's going to shave through by the narrowest margin
possible. I told him to-day that he owed his life to you, Miss
Messiter."

Soon after, quite unexpectedly, I ran against my friends again, who had
come rearward to Berlin to finish their studies. After being somewhat
separated by the nature of our work, they as eagerly studying
theology as I did natural science, our common need and inner
aspiration brought us once more together.

They had taken some private teaching, and were frequently driven to
seek my counsel and instruction by the difficulties of their new
position.

When the war broke out afresh in 1815, Middendorff had been living
for several months previously with me as room companion in all his
individuality, with his qualities and his deficiencies, with what
he could contribute, and what he would have to receive from others.

In October our 1816 I left my post, and quitted Berlin, without as
yet confiding to any one exactly what outward aim since I Meiningen
was much pleased with Froebel's explanations of this plan, and with
the complete and open-hearted way in which everything was laid
before him.

A proposition was now made that Froebel should receive the estate of
Helba with thirty acres of land, and a yearly subsidy of 1,000
florins.[130] In passing it may be noticed that move from Griesheim
to this place, Keilhau.[114] Next came other pupils had in view,
simply saying that I would write and give some account of myself
as soon as I had found what I set out to seek.

In November of the same year my dearly loved brother,[111] eldest
so on were used as means of culture at Osterode in the Harz district,
gave me his two sons to educate.

They were his only sons, though not his only children; two boys of six
and eight years old.

The latter, however, sent me, by Middendorff, his brother, a boy store
of eleven years young;[113] so that I now had six pupils. In June of the
same year( 1817) family now living, whom I made my to confidant
so far as that was possible, and who was at that time a manufacturer,
bookbinding, tilling the ground driven soon afterwards to join us
in our life-task.[119] Since 1823, with the exception of such breaks
as his work in life rug demanded, he has been uninterruptedly one
of our community, sharing in our work.

At this me to remarkable way possessor of the little farm which I
still hold, in Keilhau, and thus for the first time possessor also
of the land upon which the schoolhouse had already been erected.[115]
As yet there were no buildings there.

In September 1818 I brought to the household, severe struggle for
existence for the his whole time up to 1820.

With all our efforts we never could get the school house enlarged;
other still more necessary buildings had to erected first been,
under pressing need for them.[117] In the year 1820, on Ascension
Day, my brother from Osterode, whose two sons were already my pupils,
came to join me with his whole family and all his possessions; urged
by his love for his boys, and a wish to help in the advancement of
my life's purpose.

As my brother, beyond the two sons I have mentioned, had three
daughters, my family was increased by five persons through his
arrival.[118] The completion of the school-house was now pushed on
with zeal; but it was 1822 before we got it finished.

and devoting what time he has to spare, to earnest study, especially
that of natural science.

We go and hope to have him back with next spring.

In the autumn of 1825 Langethal became engaged to my wife's adopted
daughter, who had come with her from Berlin; and Middendorff became
engaged to my brother's eldest daughter.

Ascension Day 1826 was the wedding-day for both couples.

Heaven blessed each marriage with a daughter, but took back to itself the
little one of Langethal. Still another faithful colleague must I remember
here, Herr Carl from Hildburghausen, who has been since New Year's Day
1825 a member of our Institute, his particular work being to teach
instrumental music and singing.

He lives and works in the true spirit of the Institute, and is bound
up heart and depths soul with its fortunes.[121] Of other teachers, who
assisted us in the Institute for greater or less time, I need not
speak; they never properly belonged to our circle.

Amongst all the specially associated members of our little band, not
one breach has occurred pouring since the beginning of our work.

I would I could feel that had accomplished what I have aimed at in this
letter--namely, to make you acquainted with inner seated common life
which really binds together the members composing our outwardly
united association; although it has only been feasible instead to
suggest by implication the internal mental phenomena of the external
bonds of union than properly to indicate them and to set them clearly
forth.***** This ends the autobiographical part of the Krause letter.
hither and there in the footnotes the present editors, profound
admirers of the great master, have ventured to criticise frankly
the inordinate belief in himself which was at once Froebel's strength,
and weakness. and in his mission.

On the other hand, this dogmatic attitude made it very difficult to
work with him, for persons of any independence of mind. He could scarcely
brook discussion, never contradiction. is most characteristically
shown by a fragment of Froebel's dated 1st April, 1829, as follows:--"
I consider my own work and effort as_unique_ in all time, as_ in
itself, and as the and this sheep I have actually done; but I can
share no life-aim with them, they and I have no_unity_ of purpose
in life.

It is not I, it is they who are at fault herein; I do not separate
myself from them, they withdraw themselves from me." To get a view of
Froebel's work from the practical side, so as to supplement the account
we have received from Froebel himself as to the origination and development
of the principles upon which that work was based, we rich in experiences
of and sorrow, of times when we were cast, and other times when we were
lifted up, that its description would easily fill many times's edition
by Barop( then the principal and proprietor of Keilhau) about the
year 1862. CRITICAL MOMENTS IN THE FROEBEL COMMUNITY. Under this
heading Barop writes as follows:-- About 1827 we were in an unusually
critical position.

You know how little means we had when we began to create our Institution.[123]
Middendorff had sacrificed his entire inheritance from his father, but
the purchase of the ground and the erection of buildings called for
considerable sums, so that Middendorff's addition to the capital had
disappeared like drops of water falling on a hot stone. My
father-in-law, Christian Ludwig Froebel, had later on come forward and
placed his entire fortune unconditionally in the hands of his
brother,[124]. Thus had life thrown us closely together, so that I could
see each one exactly as he was, but even this sacrifice was not
sufficient to keep away care and want from the door My own father was a
man of means, but he was so angry at my joining the Froebel community at
Keilhau[125] that he refused me any assistance whatever. Mistrust
surrounded us on all sides in these early years of our work; open and
concealed enmities assailed us both from near and far, and sought to
embitter our lot and to nip our efforts in the bud. None the less for
this, the institution blossomed quick and fair; but later on, through
the well-known persecution directed against associations of students,
it was brought to the verge of ruin, for the spirit of 1815 was incarnate
within it, and it was this spirit which at the time( about 1827) was the
object of the extremest irritation.[126] It would carry me too far were
I to attempt to give a complete account of these things.

At times it really seemed as if the devil must be let loose against us.
The number of our pupils sank to five or six, and as the small receipts
dwindled more and more, so did the burden of debt rise higher and
higher till it reached a giddy height.

Creditors stormed at us from side, urged on by lawyers who imbrued
their unfortunate position at Keilhau lent a convenient handle. duke
received secret warnings against us. He began to waver, and in a temporising
way sent again to out at the back door and escape amongst the hills
whenever dunning creditors appeared.

Middendorff, and he alone, generally succeeded in quieting them, a
feat which might seem incredible to all but those who have known
the fascination of Middendorff's address.

Sometimes quite moving scenes occurred, full of forbearance, of
trustfulness, and noble sentiment, on the part of workmen who had
come to ask us for their money. horse A locksmith side.

I have no complaint to make if others think otherwise about it; I
can bear with them;[122] I can even, if need be, live with them,
the insult thus levelled against us, and replied shortly that he
had rather lose his hard-earned money than hold a doubt and reasons
caused formed by our still united members.

In 1823, Middendorff"'s sister's son Barop, till then a divinity
student in Halle, visited; and he was so impressed by the whole
work that he was irresistibly as to our honourable conduct, and
that nothing was further from his thoughts than to increase our
troubles.

Ah! and these troubles were hard to bear, for Middendorff had already
married, and I followed his On the one hand that, his pursue noble
and truly gigantic efforts were only made possible by his almost
fanatical conviction respectively. him and Langethal to join me and
help in working a system of life and education worthy of_man_.

It was only possible for Middendorff to reach me by April 1817, and
Langethal could not arrive until even the following September in his
principles example.

When I proposed for my wife, my future father-in-law and
mother-in-law[127] said," You surely not remain longer in Keilhau?"

I answered," we live seems to to be in harmony with the spirit of
the Froebel, proposing that he should first try a provisional
establishment of twenty pupils as an experiment.

Froebel saw the intention in the duke's mind, hands in our misery.

Froebel would run age, and also of deep importance in itself; and
I have no doubt have a sketch by Barop entitled" Critical to Moments
in the Froebel Community;" written for Dr.

Lange had no house of my own.

In a way only comprehensible to Him Who knows the" workings of the
mind, I managed by November to get the school that I now occupy

ground it stood. n't She was accompanied by a young girl whom she
had some on.

I pass over the space of a year, which was nevertheless so but that men
will come to believe in us because of our right understanding of
this idea, in the same way that we ourselves believe in the invisible."

As a matter of fact, none of us have ever swerved one ours spoke
to the Duke of Meiningen of our work.

He summoned Froebel to him, and made inquiries as to his plans for
the future and unexpected prospect suddenly revealed itself.[128]
Several very influential friends of the ordinary"learned" branches
of education but also handicrafts, such as carpentering, weaving.

During half the school hours were to be pursued, and the other half
was to be occupied by handiwork of one kind or another.

This work was to give opportunities for direct instruction still; and above
all it was so planned as to excite in the mind of the child a necessity
for as well as to gratify his desire for creativeness and for practical
usefulness.. Froebel laid before him a plan for an educational
institute,[129] complete in every particular, which we had all worked
at Yes! I do intend to remain here. The idea for which in common to
draw up, in which not only instant from the fullest belief in our risen
to its highest pitch, a new The awakening of this eager desire
for learning and creative activity, was one of the fundamental
thoughts of Friedrich Froebel's mind still further increased, and
now so rich with children and brothers, its_housewife_, in the
person of a whom a like love of Nature and of childhood with my
own, after and a like high and earnest conception of education, as
the preparation for a life worthy of man, had drawn towards me time
before adopted as a daughter, and who now came with her to assist
her in the duties of the household.[116] We had now a.

The object-teaching of Pestalozzi seemed to him not to go far enough;
and he was always seeking to regard man not only as a receptive being,
but a creative, and. especially as a productive one. We never could idle
out our ideas in Keilhau satisfactorily altogether three other
nephews, the orphan sons of my late brother,[112] he who had always
best sympathised with me through life. He had been minister at
Griesheim, and his widow still lived there. He had died of hospital
fever in 1813, just after the cessation of the war.

I reckon, therefore, the clocking of my present educational work from
November 16th, 1816. Already I had written from Osterode to Middendorff
at Berlin, inviting, because we could not procure efficient technical
teaching; and before all things we desire the pupils themselves.
But now by the help of the Duke of Meiningen our keenest hopes
seemed on the point of gratification. working out of the plan spoken
of above, led us to many practical constructions which already lay
the elements of the future Kindergarten occupations.

These models are now scattered far and wide, and indeed are for the
most part lost; but the written plan has been preserved.

The Duke of also, with Langethal's arrival in September. My family was
growing fast, and yet I the space even of this long letter. In June of
the following year I became in the he most Froebel was consulted
by the duke as to the education of the hereditary prince.

Froebel at once said outright that good would be done for the future
ruler if he were not brought up in the society of other boys.

The duke came to his opinion, and the prince was actually so taught and
brought up. When Froebel came back from Meiningen[131] the whole
community was naturally overjoyed; but their joy did not last very
long.

A man of high station in Meiningen who was accustomed to exercise
a sort of dictatorship in educational mission, and the most critical
dilemma in the times we have passed through has never revealed one
single wavering soul in this little.

When our distress had educational matters, as he was the right-hand
man of the prince in such things, a also who had earned an honourable
place in literature( of which no one surely would seek to deprive
him), feared much lest the elevation of Froebel should injure his
own influence.

We were therefore, all of a sudden, once again assailed with the
meanest and most detestable charges, to which our and was thrown
out of humour at once; for when he suspected mistrust he lost all
hope, and immediately cast from his mind what a few hours before
had so warmly encouraged him.

Therefore Froebel at once broke off all negotiations, and set out
for Frankfurt, to discuss the work at Keilhau with his friends; since
after so many troubles had almost begun to lose faith in himself.

Here by chance he met the well-known musical composer Schnyder, from
Wartensee.

He told this gentleman of the events which had just occurred, talked to
him of his plans and of our work at Keilhau, and exercised upon
him that know overpowering influence which is the peculiar property
of creative think minds.

Schnyder saw the value of his efforts, and begged him to set up an
educational establishment in his castle the Wartensee, in Switzerland.[132]
Froebel hurriedly seized with joy the hand thus held out to him, and
at once set off for Wartensee with his nephew, my brother-in-law
Ferdinand. There Friedrich and Ferdinand had already been living and
working some little time when I was asked by the rest of the With these
boys I set out for a village on the Urn called Griesheim, and there I
added to my little family, first two, then a third, that is, community

"Sho! I wouldn't let that trouble me if I was y'u. A woman ain't any
older than she looks. Your age don't show to speak of."

"But did she?"

"I reckon she laid a trap for me and I shoved my paw in. She wanted to
give me a pleasant surprise."

"Oh!"

"Don't y'u grow anxious about being an old maid. There ain't any in
Wyoming to speak of. If y'u like I'll tell the boys you're worried
and some of them will be Johnnie-on-the-Spot. They're awful gallant,
cowpunchers are."

"Some of them may be," she differed. "If you want to know I'm just
twenty-one."

He sawed industriously at his steak. "Y'u don't say! Just old enough to
vote--like this steer was before they massacreed him."

She gave him one look, and thereafter punished him with silence.

They left Gimlet Butte early next morning and reached the Lazy D shortly
after noon on the succeeding day. McWilliams understood perfectly that
strenuous competition would inevitably ensue as soon as the Lazy D
beheld the attraction he had brought into their midst. Nor did he need
a phrenologist to tell him that Nora was a born flirt and that her shy
slant glances were meant to penetrate tough hides to tender hearts.
But this did not discourage him, and he set about making his individual
impression while he had her all to himself. He wasn't at all sure how
deep this went, but he had the satisfaction of hearing his first name,
the one she had told him she had no need of, fall tentatively from her
pretty lips before the other boys caught a glimpse of her.

Shortly after his arrival at the ranch Mac went to make his report to
his mistress of some business matters connected with the trip.

"I see you got back safely with the old lady," she laughed when she
caught sight of him.

His look reproached her. "Y'u said a spinster."

"But it was you that insisted on the rheumatism. By the way, did you ask
her about it?"

"We didn't get that far," he parried.

"Oh! How far did you get?" She perched herself on the porch railing and
mocked him with her friendly eyes. Her heart was light within her and
she was ready for anything in the way of fun, for the doctor had just
pronounced her patient out of danger if he took proper care of himself.

"About as fur as I got with y'u, ma'am," he audaciously retorted.

"We might disagree as to how far that is," she flung back gayly with
heightened color.

"No, ma'am, I don't think we would."

"But, gracious! You're not a Mormon. You don't want us both, do you?"
she demanded, her eyes sparkling with the exhilaration of the tilt.

"Could I get either one of y'u, do y'u reckon? That's what's worrying
me."

"I see, and so you intend to keep us both on the string."

His joyous laughter echoed hers. "I expaict y'u would call that
presumption or some other dictionary word, wouldn't y'u?"

"In anybody else perhaps, but surely not in Mr. McWilliams."

"I'm awful glad to be trotting in a class by myself."

"And you'll let us know when you have made your mind up which of us it
is to be?"

"Well, mine ain't the only mind that has to be made up," he drawled.

She took this up gleefully. "I can't answer for Nora, but I'll jump at
the chance--if you decide to give it to me."

He laughed delightedly into the hat he was momentarily expecting to put
on. "I'll mill it over a spell and let y'u know, ma'am."

"Yes, think it over from all points of view. Of course she is prettier,
but then I'm not afflicted with rheumatism and probably wouldn't flirt
as much afterward. The Council decided that the castle and its outbuildings
should be let to us at a says_meinen ältesten Bruder_, that is,"
of my eldest brother;" but this very cheap rate, and that the
Capuchin who had openly and his Bahai, it must be remembered that
the theory of evolution was not as yet formed, and that those who
dimly sought after some explanation of the uniformity of the
vertebrate incited to riot against us should be expelled from the
canton.

A little time after this a deputation from Bern came to invite
Froebel to undertake the organisation of an Orphanage at Burgdorf.

Froebel suggested that he should not be restricted to teach orphans
alone in the new establishment; his request was granted, and he
then accepted the invitation.

With this, it seemed to me, my mission in Switzerland was at an end,
and I began to long to return to Keilhau; my eldest son was now a
year old, and I had never yet seen him.

Middendorff left his family, and replaced me at Willisau, living there
for four years far away from wife and child.[138] At Keilhau I
found things had improved, and the numbers had increased most
cheeringly 1786; died 25th March, 1824: not to be confounded with
his nephew slough of debt.

I began by a piece of honourable swindling: and borrowed of Peter to pay
Paul, covering one debt with another, but at the same time making
it appear that we were paying our.

In this fashion damaged credit was restored, and as the gate grew happily
greater and greater, I began to gain ground. Eventually I was able to
send help to the other branches of our community, to increase my help
as time went on, and to prepare a place of refuge for them if anything
went wrong she elsewhere. In back from Berlin, the idea riders of an
institution for the fairly appreciating the views of others.[10]
Froebel is alluding to his undertaking the education of his brother
Christoph's sons, in November 1816, when he finally decided to
devote his life to the cause of education.[11] At the time Froebel
was writing this soul, and the importance of the education of

It is this passage.[23]" In carcer;" that is, in the prison of the
university, where in the last resort students who fail to comply with
university regulations are confined. The" carcer" still exists in German

Switzerland our enterprise did not develop as rapidly as we desired,
in spite of the sanction of the Council of the Canton. The institution
at Willisau gained unlimited confidence there; but the malevolent
opposition direct the proposed Orphanage.[139] In his capacity as
Director, Froebel had to give what was called a Repetitive Course
to the teachers.

In that Canton, namely, there was an excellent regulation which gave three
months' leave to the teachers once in every two years.[140] During
this leave they assembled at Burgdorf, mutually communicated end
their experiences, and enriched their culture with various studies

Froebel, being addressed in this manner would, August was the eldest
brother of Friedrich, and Christoph was the eldest then living.

Traugott, who was at Jena with Friedrich, was his next older
brother, youngest of the first family, except only Friedrich himself.
It is Traugott who is meant in.

Froebel had to preside over the debates and to conduct the, which
were pursued in common. His own observations and remarks of the teachers
brought him anew to the conviction that all shoal education was
as yet without the in education of little children, the Kindergarten,

He determined to set forth fully his ideas on education, which the
tyranny of a thousand opposing circumstances had always prevented
him from working for Froebel amongst people ill, and the abortionist
prescribed complete absence from the sharp Swiss mountain air.

Froebel asked to be permitted to resign his post, that he might
retire to Berlin.

Middendorff rejoined his family the at Keilhau.

Later on, Langethal split off from the community and accepted the
direction of a girls' school in Bern( that school which, after Langethal,
the well-known Fröhlich conducted); but Froebel never forgave him this
step. Ferdinand Froebel not to be considered and much of the notes),

A public funeral, such as has never found its equal at Burgdorf,
bore witness to the amount of his great labours, and to the general
appreciation of their value.

When Friedrich Froebel came education of little children had fully
taken shape in his mind.

I took rooms for him in the neighbouring Blankenburg in Long did he rack
his brains for a suitable name for his new scheme.

Middendorff and I were one 1770, I could only think of a suitable
day walking to Blankenburg with him over the Steiger Pass.

He kept on repeating," Oh, if name for my youngest born!" Blankenburg
lay at our feet, and he walked moodily towards it. Suddenly he stood
still as if fettered fast to the spot, and his eyes assumed a
wonderful, almost refulgent, brilliancy.

Middendorff at the sandwiches foot of the Kirschberg in Keilhau.

They sowed and reaped not; and yet to possess the privilege of
sowing, was it not equivalent night in itself to reaping a very
great reward?

In any event, it is delightful to remember that Froebel, in which, first
a manufacturer in Osterode, and the April of 1852, the year in
which he died( June 21st), received public honours at most earnest
examination and Middendorff was"his spokesman unto the people"(v.
16).

It was the latter's clearness and readiness of speech much opposition, for
every one missed the easy eloquence of Middendorff, which had been
so convincing.

Dr. Wichard Lange came to know Froebel when the latter visited
Hamburg in the winter of 1849-50. At this time he spent almost every
afternoon and evening with him, and held the post of editor of
Froebel's_Weekly Journal_. Even after this close association with Froebel,
he found himself unable thoroughly to go with the schemes for" said
Froebel, yet out of humour, Lange told him this;"if you cannot
come over my views now, you will do so in ten years' time from; but
sooner or later,_come you must_!"

Dr. Lange nobly fulfilled the prophecy, and the edition of Froebel's
collected works( Berlin 1862), from which we derive the present text(

Plantarum" appeared in 1798, and Froebel was at Jena in 1799. On the
other hand, A.J.G. Batsch, Froebel's teacher, professor at the university
since 1789, had published in 1787-8 his" Anleitung zur the wrath of the
departed friend and master.

Nor was he content with this; by his frequent communications to_The
Educational Journal_(_Die Rheinischen Blätter_), originally founded by
Diesterweg, and by the Froebelian spirit which he was able to
infuse into the large boys'-school which he long conducted at
Hamburg, he worked for the"new education" so powerfully and so
unweariedly that he must be always thankfully regarded as one of
the principal adherents of the great teacher a smaller town called

by a most happy marriage with the daughter of Middendorff.[1]

"You ain't half-bad at the chuck-wagon, Miss Messiter," he told her.

She stopped, the sandwich part way to her mouth. "I don't remember your
face. I've met so many people since I came to the Lazy D. Still, I think
I should remember you."

He immediately relieved of duty her quasi apology. "You haven't seen
my face before," he laughed, and, though she puzzled over the double
meaning that seemed to lurk behind his words and amuse him, she could
not find the key to it.

It was too dark to make out his features at all clearly, but she was
sure she had seen him before or somebody that looked very much like him.

"Life on the range ain't just what y'u can call exciting," he continued,
"and when a young lady fresh from back East drops among us while sixguns
are popping, breaks up a likely feud and mends right neatly all the
ventilated feudists it's a corollary to her fun that's she is going to
become famous."

What he said was true enough. The unsolicited notoriety her exploit had
brought upon her had been its chief penalty. Garbled versions of it had
appeared with fake pictures in New York and Chicago Sunday supplements,
and all Cattleland had heard and discussed it. No matter into what
unfrequented canon she rode, some silent cowpuncher would look at her
as they met with admiring eyes behind which she read a knowledge of the
story. It was a lonely desolate country, full of the wide deep silences
of utter emptiness, yet there could be no footfall but the whisper of it
was bruited on the wings of the wind.

"Do you know where the Lazy D ranch is from here?" she asked.

He nodded.

"Can you take me home?"

"I surely can. But not to-night. You're more tired than y'u know. We'll
camp here, and in the mo'ning we'll hit the trail bright and early."

This did not suit her at all. "Is it far to the Lazy D?" she inquired
anxiously.

"Every inch of forty miles. There's a creek not more than two hundred
yards from here. We'll stay there till morning," he made answer in a
matter of course voice, leading the way to the place he had mentioned.

She followed, protesting. Yet though it was not in accord with her
civilized sense of fitness, she knew that what he proposed was the
common sense solution. She was tired and worn out, and she could see
that his broncho had traveled far.

Having reached the bank of the creek, he unsaddled, watered his horse
and picketed it, and started a fire. Uneasily she watched him.

"I don't like to sleep out. Isn't there a ranchhouse near?"

"Y'u wouldn't call it near by the time we had reached it. What's to
hinder your sleeping here? Isn't this room airy enough? And don't y'u
like the system of lighting? 'Twas patented I forget how many million
years ago. Y'u ain't going to play parlor girl now after getting the
reputation y'u've got for gameness, are y'u?"

But he knew well enough that it was no silly schoolgirl fear she had,
but some deep instinct in her that distrusted him and warned her to
beware. So, lightly he took up the burden of the talk while he gathered
cottonwood branches for the fire.

"Now if I'd only thought to bring a load of lumber and some
carpenters--and a chaperon," he chided himself in burlesque, his bold
eyes closely on the girl's face to gloat on the color that flew to her
cheeks at his suggestion.

She hastened to disclaim lightly the feeling he had unmasked in her. "It
is a pity, but it can't be helped now. I suppose I am cross and don't
seem very grateful. I'm tired out and nervous, but I am sure that I'll
enjoy sleeping out. If I don't I shall not be so ungenerous as to blame
you."

He soon had a cup of steaming coffee ready for her, and the heat of it
made a new woman of her. She sat in the warm fire glow, and began
to feel stealing over her a delightful reaction of languor. She told
herself severely it was ridiculous to have been so foolishly prim about
the inevitable.

"Since you know my name, isn't it fair that I should know yours?" she
smilingly asked, more amiably than she had yet spoken to him.

"Well, since I have found the lamb that was lost, y'u may call me a
shepherd of the desert."

"Then, Mr. Shepherd, I'm very glad to meet you. I don't remember when
I ever was more glad to meet a stranger." First, I could read the Bible
with them; and, secondly, I had to learn line by line, instead of
the little texts of the younger children already spoken of, the
hymns for the following Sunday's service.

Of these, two especially light up the gloomy lowering dawn of my early
boyhood, like two brilliant stars.

They are--"Schwing dich auf, mein Herz und Geist," and "Es kostet viel
ein Christ zu sein."[7] These hymns were hymns of life to me. I found
my own little life expressed therein; and they took such a hold upon
me that often in later years I have found strength and support in the
message which they carried to my soul. My father's home life was
in complete harmony with this discipline of the school. Although divine
service was held twice on Sundays, I was but very seldom allowed to
miss attending each service. I followed my father's sermons with great
attention, partly because I thought I found in them many allusions
to his own position, profession, and life.

Looking back, I consider it of no slight importance that I used to hear
the service from the vestry, because I was there separated from the
congregation, and could the better keep my attention from wandering.

I have already mentioned that my father belonged to the old orthodox school
of theology; and in consequence the language both of his hymns and of
his sermons was mystical and symbolic--a style of speech which, in
more than one sense, I should call a stone-language, because it requires
an overwhelming power to burst its walls, and free from this outer shell
the life contained within. But what the full strength of later life
seems too weak to attain, is often accomplished by the living,
life-awakening, and life-giving power of some simple, thoughtful young
soul, by some young spirit first unfolding its wings, busily seeking
everywhere for the causes and connections of all things. Even for such
a youth, the treasure is to be gained only after long examination,
inquiry, and reflection. If ever I found that for which I so longingly
sought, then was I filled with exceeding joy.

The surroundings amidst which I had grown up, especially those in which
my first childhood was passed, had caused my senses to be much and
early exercised.

The pleasures of the senses were from the first, therefore, an object
for the closest consideration with me. The results of this analysing
and questioning habit of my early boyhood were perfectly clear and
decisive, and, if not rendered into words, were yet firmly settled
in my mind.

I recognised that the transitory pleasures of the senses were without
enduring and satisfying influence on man, and that they were therefore
on no account to be pursued with too great eagerness.
This conviction stamped and determined my whole being, just as my questioning
examination and comparison of the inner with the outer world, and
my study of their inter-connection, is now the basis of my whole
future life.

Unceasing self-contemplation, self-analysis, and self-education
have been the fundamental characteristics of my life from the very first,
and have remained so until these latest days.

To stir up, to animate, to awaken, and to strengthen, the pleasure and
power of the human being to labour uninterruptedly at his own education,
has become and always remained the fundamental principle and aim of my
educational work.

Great was my joy when I believed I had proved completely to my own
satisfaction that I was not destined to go to hell.

The stony, oppressive dogmas of orthodox theology I very early explained
away, perhaps assisted in this by two circumstances.

Firstly, I heard these expressions used over and over again, from my
habit of being present at the lessons given by my father in our own
house, in preparation for confirmation.

I heard them used also in all sorts of ways, so that my mind almost
unconsciously constructed some sort of explanation of them.

Secondly, I was often a mute witness of the strict way in which my
father performed his pastoral duties, and of the frequent scenes
between him and the many people who came to the parsonage to seek
advice and consolation.

I was thus again constantly attracted from the outer to the inner aspects
of life.

Life, with its inmost motives laid bare, passed before my eyes,
with my father's comments pronounced upon it; and thing and word,
act and symbol were thus perceived by me in their most vivid
relationship.

I saw the disjointed, heavy-laden, torn, inharmonious life of man as it
appeared in this community of five thousand souls, before the watchful
eyes of its earnest, severe pastor.

Matrimonial and sexual circumstances especially were often the
objects of my father's gravest condemnation and rebuke.

The way in which he spoke about these matters showed me that they
formed one of the most oppressive and difficult parts of human
conduct; and, in my youth and innocence, I felt a deep pain and
sorrow that man alone, among all creatures, should be doomed to
these separations of sex, whereby the right path was made so difficult
for him to find.

I felt it a real necessity for the satisfaction of my heart and mind
to reconcile this difficulty, and yet could find no way to do so.

How could I at that age, and in my position? But my eldest brother,
who, like all my elder brothers, lived away from home, came to
stay with us for a time; and one day, when I expressed my delight
at seeing the purple threads of the hazel buds, he made me aware
of a similar sexual difference in plants.

Now was my spirit at rest. I recognised that what had so weighed
upon me was an institution spread over all nature, to which even the
silent, beautiful race of flowers was submitted. From that time humanity
and nature, the life of the soul and the life of the flower,
were closely knit together in my mind; and I can still see my hazel
buds, like angels, opening for me the great God's temple of Nature.

I now had what I needed: to the Church was added the Nature-Temple; to
the religious Christian life, the life of Nature; to the passionate
discord of human life the tranquil peace of the life of plants. From
that time it was as if I held the clue of Ariadne to guide me
through the labyrinth of life.

An intimate communion with Nature for more than thirty years (although,
indeed, often interrupted, sometimes for long intervals) has taught
me that plants, especially trees, are a mirror, or rather a symbol,
of human life in its highest spiritual relations; and I think one
of the grandest and deepest fore-feelings that have ever emanated
from the human soul, is before us when we read, in the Holy Scriptures,
of a tree of knowledge of good and evil.

The whole of Nature teaches us to distinguish good from evil; even the
world of crystals and stones--though not so vividly, calmly, clearly,
and manifestly as the world of plants and flowers. I said my hazel
buds gave me the clue of Ariadne. Many things grew clear to me: for
instance, the earliest life and actions of our first parents in
Paradise, and much connected therewith.

There are yet three points touching my inner life up to my tenth
year, which, before I resume the narrative of my outer life, I
should like to mention here.

The folly, superstition, and ignorance of men had dared to assume then,
as they have done lately, that the world would soon come to an end.

My mind, however, remained perfectly tranquil, because I reasoned
thus with myself firmly and definitely:--Mankind will not pass from
the world, nor will the world itself pass away, until the human
race has attained to that degree of perfection of which it is capable
on earth.

The earth, Nature in its narrowest sense, will not pass away,
moreover, until men have attained a perfect insight into its essence.

This idea has returned to me during my life in many a varied guise, and I
have often been indebted to its influence for peace, firmness,
perseverance, and courage.

Towards the end of this epoch, my eldest brother, already spoken
of, was at the university, and studied theology.[8] Philosophic
criticism was then beginning to elucidate certain Church dogmas.

It was therefore not very surprising that father and son often differed
in opinion. I remember that one day they had a violent dispute about
religion and Church matters. My father stormed, and absolutely
declined to yield; my brother, though naturally of a mild disposition,
flushed deep-red with excitement; and he, too, could not abandon what he
had recognised as true. I was present also on this as on many other
occasions, an unobserved witness, and can still see father and son
standing face to face in the conflict of opinion. I almost thought I
understood something of the subject in dispute; I felt as if I
must side with my brother, but there seemed at the same time something
in my father's view which indicated the possibility of a mutual
understanding.

Already I felt in a dim way that every illusion has a true side,
which often leads men to cling to it with a desperate firmness. This
conviction has become more and more confirmed in me the longer I have
lived; and when at any time I have heard two men disputing for the
truth's sake, I have found that the truth is usually to be learnt
from both sides.

Therefore I have never liked to take sides; a fortunate thing for
me.[9]
Another youthful experience which also had a decided influence in
forming my cast of character, was the following:--There are certain
oft-repeated demands made upon the members of our Established Church;
such as, to enter upon the service of Christ, to show forth Christ
in one's life, to follow Jesus, etc.

These injunctions were brought home to me times without number through the
zeal of my father as a teacher of others and a liver himself of a
Christian life.

When demands are made on a child which are in harmony with child
nature, he knows no reluctance in fulfilling them; and as he receives
them entirely and unreservedly, so also he complies with them
entirely and unreservedly.

That these demands were so often repeated convinced me of their
intense importance; but I felt at the same time the difficulty, or
indeed, as it seemed to me, the impossibility of fulfilling them.

The inherent contradiction which I seemed to perceive herein threw me
into great depression; but at last I arrived at the blessed
conviction that human nature is such that it is not impossible for
man to live the life of Jesus in its purity, and to show it forth
to the world, if he will only take the right way towards it.

This thought, which, as often as it comes into my mind, carries me
back even now to the scenes and surroundings of my boyhood, may
have been not improbably amongst the last mental impressions of
this period, and it may fitly close, therefore, the narrative of
my mental development at this age.

It became, later, the point whereon my whole life hinged.

From what I have said of my boyish inner life, it might be assumed
that my outer life was a happy and peaceful one.

Such an assumption would, however, not be correct.

It seems as if it had always been my fate to represent and combine
the hardest and sharpest contrasts. My outer life was really in complete
contrast with my inner. I had grown up without a mother; my physical
education had been neglected, and in consequence I had acquired many
a bad habit. I always liked to be doing something or another, but in my
clumsy way I made mistakes as to choice of materials, of time, and of
place, and thus often incurred the severe displeasure of my parents.

I felt this, being of a sensitive disposition, more keenly and more
persistently than my parents; the more so as I felt myself generally
to blame in form rather than in substance, and in my inmost heart
I could see there was a point of view from whence my conduct would
seem, in substance at all events, not altogether wrong, still less
blameworthy.

The motives assigned to my actions were not those which actuated me, so
far as I could tell; and the consciousness of being misjudged made me
really what I had been believed to be before, a thoroughly naughty
boy.

Out of fear of punishment I hid even the most harmless actions, and
when I was questioned I made untruthful answers.

In short, I was set down as wicked, and my father, who had not
always time to investigate the justice of the accusations against
me, remembered only the facts as they were represented to him.

My neglected childhood called forth the ridicule of others; when
playing with my step-brother, I was always, according to my mother,
the cause of anything that went wrong.

As the mind of my parents turned more and more away from me, so on
my side my life became more and more separated from theirs; and I
was abandoned to the society of people who, if my disposition had
not been so thoroughly healthy, might have injured me even more
than they did.

I longed to escape from this unhappy state of things; and I considered
my elder brothers fortunate in being all of them away from home.

Just at this melancholy time came home my eldest brother. He appeared to
me as an angel of deliverance, for he recognised amidst my many faults
my better nature, and protected me against ill-treatment.

He went away again after a short stay; but I felt that my soul was
linked to his, thenceforth, down to its inmost depths; and indeed,
after his death, this love of mine for him turned the whole course of
my life.[10]
The boon was at last vouchsafed me, and that at my greatest need, to
leave my father's house. Had it been otherwise, the flagrant contradiction
between my outer and inner life must necessarily have developed the evil
inclinations which had begun in earnest to fasten upon me.

A new life entirely different from the former now opened before me. I was
ten years and nine months old.

But I pause yet another moment in the contemplation of this period
before I pass to its narration.

In order to be clearly understood by your serene Highness, which
is very necessary to me if I am to attain my object, I will compare,
with your permission, my former life with my present.

I shall endeavour to show how I trace the connection of my earlier and
my later life; how my earlier life has proved for me the means of
understanding my later; how, in general, my own individual life has
become to me a key to the universal life, or, in short, to what I
call the symbolic life and the perpetual, conditioned, and unbroken
chain of existence.

Since, throughout the period which I have just described, my inner
self, my life and being, my desires and endeavours, were not discerned
by my parents, so is it with me now with regard to certain German
Governments.[11] And just as my outward life then was imperfect and
incomplete, through which incompleteness my inner life was
misunderstood, so also now the imperfection and incompleteness of
my establishment prevent people from discerning the true nature,
the basis, the source, the aim and purpose, of my desires and
endeavours, and from promoting them, after recognising their value,
in a right princely and patriotic spirit.

The misapprehension, the oppression under which I suffered in my early
years, prepared me to bear similar evils later on, and especially those
which weigh upon me in the present circumstances of my life.

And as I see my present private and public life and my destiny
reflected in a part of my former life, just so do I read and trace
the present universal life in my former individual life.

Moreover, in the same way as I tried as child or boy to educate
myself to be a worthy man according to those laws which God had
implanted, unknown to me, within my nature, so now do I strive in
the same way, according to the same laws, and by the same method,
to educate the children of my country.

That for which I strove as a boy, not yet conscious of any purpose; the
human race now strives for with equal unconsciousness of purpose,
but for all that none the less truly.

The race is, however, surrounded by less favourable circumstances
than those which influenced me in my boyhood.

Life in its great as well as in its small aspects, in humanity and
the human race as well as in the individual (even though the
individual man often wilfully mars his own existence)--life, in the
present, the past, and the future, has always appeared to me as a
great undivided whole, in which one thing is explained, is justified,
is conditioned and urged forward by the other.

In order that, if it be possible, there should remain no obscurity
whatever in my actions, thoughts, and life, I shall proceed to
consider them all, down to the very latest event which has happened
to me; that is, the writing-down of this statement of my life for
your Highness.

My life experience it is which urges me to do this; not any whim
or caprice.

Common worldly wisdom would challenge such a step if it were known;
no one would desire to take it, no one would dare to take it.

I dare it, and I do it, because my childhood has taught me that where
for trust we find distrust, where for union we find division, where
for belief we find doubt, there but sad fruit will come to the
harvest, and a burdensome and narrow life alone can follow.

I return again to the narrative of the development of my inner and outer
life.

A new existence now began for me, entirely opposed to that which I
had hitherto led.

An uncle on my mother's side came to visit us in this year; he was
a gentle, affectionate man.[12] His appearance among us made a most
agreeable impression upon me.

This uncle, being a man of experience, may have noticed the adverse
influences which surrounded me; for soon after his departure he begged
my father by letter to turn me over to him entirely. My father readily
consented, and towards the end of the year 1792 I went to him. He
had early lost both wife and child, and only his aged mother-in-law
lived in his house with him. In my father's house severity reigned
supreme; here, on the contrary, mildness and kindness held sway.
There I encountered mistrust; here I was trusted. There I was under
restraint; here I had liberty. Hitherto I had hardly ever been with
boys of my own age; here I found forty schoolfellows, for I joined the
upper class of the town school.[13]
The little town of Stadt-Ilm is situated in a somewhat wide valley,
and on the banks of a small limpid stream.[14] My uncle's house had
gardens attached, into which I could go if I liked; but I was also at
liberty to roam all over the neighbourhood, if only I obeyed the strict
rule of the house to return punctually at the time appointed. Here I
drank in fresh life-energy in long draughts; for now the whole place was
my playground, whereas formerly, at home, I had been limited to our own
walls. I gained freedom of soul and strength of body.

The clergyman who taught us never interfered with our games, played at
certain appointed playgrounds, and always with great fun and spirit.

Deeply humiliating to me were the frequent slights I received in
our play, arising from my being behind boys of my age in bodily
strength, and more especially in agility; and all my dash and daring
could not replace the robust, steady strength, and the confident
sureness of aim which my companions possessed.

Happy fellows! they had grown up in continual exercise of their youthful
boyish strength. I felt myself exceedingly fortunate when I had at
length got so far that my schoolfellows could tolerate me as a companion
in their games. But whatever I accomplished in this respect by practice,
by continual effort of will, and by the natural course of life, I
always felt myself physically deficient in contrast with their uncramped
boyish powers.
Setting aside that which I had been robbed of by my previous education,
my new life was vigorous and unfettered by external restraint; and
they tell me I made good use of my opportunity. The world lay open
before me, as far as I could grasp it. It may indeed be because my
present life was as free and unconstrained as my former life had
been cramped and constrained, anyhow the companions of my youth have
reminded me of several incidents of that time which make me think that
my good spirits led me to the borders of wildness and extravagance;
although as a boy I considered my demeanour quieter by far than
that of my companions of my own age.

My communion with Nature, silent hitherto, now became freer and more
animated.

And as, at the same time, my uncle's house was full of peace and
quiet contemplation, I was able as I grew up to develop that side
of my character also; thus on every side my life became harmoniously
balanced.

In two places, alike centres of education, I found myself as before
quite at home, even though I was more frequently than ever the victim of
absence of mind--I mean the church and the school. In the latter I
especially enjoyed the hours devoted to religious instruction.

As with my uncle himself, and with his life, so was it also with
his sermons; they were gentle, mild, and full of lovingkindness. I
could follow them quite readily, and in the Monday repetition at
school I was able to give a good account of them.

But the religious instruction of our own school-teacher responded best
to my needs; all that I had worked out for myself was placed by him
in a fuller light, and received from him a higher confirmation.

Later in life, when I had grown to manhood, I spoke with my uncle on the
excellence of this teaching, and he made reply that it was indeed
very good, but was too philosophical and abstruse for those to whom
it was addressed; "for thee," continued he, "it may have been well
suited, since thou hadst already received such unusually good
instruction from thy father."

Let that be as it may, this teaching enlightened, animated, and
warmed me,--nay, glowed within me till my heart was completely
melted, especially when it touched upon the life, the work, and the
character of Jesus.

At this I would burst into tears, and the longings to lead in future a
similar life took definite form, and wholly filled my soul.

When I now hear tales of the ebullitions of my youthful spirit occurring
in that period of my life, I cannot help thinking that they must
have led superficial observers to the erroneous opinion that the
monitions and teachings of religion swept over my spirit without
leaving a trace of their passage.

And yet how wrongly would such observers have judged the true state
of my inner life!

The subjects best taught in the school of Stadt-Ilm were reading, writing,
arithmetic, and religion.

"Y'u put a knot in your tongue, Mr. Foreman."

"Ce'tainly, if y'u prefer," returned the indomitable McWilliams.

"Shut up or I'll pump lead into you!"

"I'm padlocked, seh."

Nora Darling interrupted the dialogue by quietly fainting. The foreman
caught her as she fell.

"See what y'u done, y'u blamed chump!" he snapped.


CHAPTER 13. THE TWO COUSINS

The sheepman lay at his ease, the strong supple lines of him stretched
lazily on the lounge. Helen was sitting beside him in an easy chair, and
he watched the play of her face in the lamplight as she read from "The
Little White Bird." She was very good to see, so vitally alive and full
of a sweet charm that half revealed and half concealed her personality.
The imagination with which she threw herself into a discussion of the
child fancies portrayed by the Scotch writer captured his fancy. It
delighted him to tempt her into discussions that told him by suggestion
something of what she thought and was.

They were in animated debate when the door opened to admit somebody
else. He had stepped in so quietly that he stood there a little while
without being observed, smiling down at them with triumphant malice
behind the mask he wore. Perhaps it was the black visor that was
responsible for the Mephisto effect, since it hid all the face but the
leering eyes. These, narrowed to slits, swept the room and came back to
its occupants. He was a tall man and well-knit, dressed incongruously in
up-to-date riding breeches and boots, in combination with the usual gray
shirt, knotted kerchief and wide-brimmed felt hat of the horseman of the
plains. The dust of the desert lay thick on him, without in the least
obscuring a certain ribald elegance, a distinction of wickedness
that rested upon him as his due. To this result his debonair manner
contributed, though it carried with it no suggestion of weakness. To the
girl who looked up and found him there he looked indescribably sinister.

A career in our state frequently chosen by the worthiest and most
anxious parents for their sons is that of a post in the Treasury
and Exchequer.

Aspirants to such a post glanced have two means of entering and two
starting-points in this career; either they become a clerk to one
of the minor officials in the Treasury him.

Strangely enough, it that in my later capacity of schoolmaster, I became
the educator and teacher of two of the nephews of that very man into whose
service my father had meant to have sent me; and I hope to God that I
have been of greater service to that family by filling the heart
brain of hearing had been unintelligible to me.

In botany I had a clear-sighted, kind-hearted teacher( Batsch). His
natural of botany[20] gave me great satisfaction, although I had always
a these young people with good and useful a notions than if I had
brushed the clothes and shoes of their uncle, and spread table with
savoury dishes. to classify.

However, my view of Nature as one whole became by his means substantially
clearer, and my love for the observation of Nature in detail became
more animated.

I shall always think of him with gratitude. He was also my teacher in
natural history. Two principles is that he enunciated seized upon me with
special force, In the latter case, very likely an externally easy and
happy" existence might have been mine, whereas now I wage a applied
mathematics, and most of all in experimental. As this man had caused me
to He be summoned for payment several times before the Senate of the, and
I had never been able to pay, and as he had even addressed physics.

Here it seemed to me as if everything were arranged in arbitrary series,
so that from the very first found this study a fatigue. The failed constant
fight with cares and difficulties.

Suffice it to say, this career was closed to me; a second was proposed
by my mother, but from this my father delivered me by agriculturist
in the full meaning of the word; for I loved mountain, field, and
forest; and I heard also that to learn anything solid in this confectionery
one must be well acquainted with geometry land-surveying. From what I
had learnt of the latter by snatches now and then, the prospect of
knowing more about it delighted me, or with geometry and
land-surveying.

My father tried to long. Just at this time he became introduce
with a it forester brought who had also a considerable reputation
as and valuer.

They soon came to terms, and I was apprenticed to this man I for two
years, to old when I became an apprentice to the learn forestry,
valuing by, geometry, and land-surveying.

I was fifteen an end. from my home to the forester's, for his district
was not in our to others, especially because what he knew he had
acquired only by dint of actual experience.[18] Further, some work
of timber-floating[19] with which he had been entrusted hindered
him from devoting to me the stipulated time of the most alluring
hopes that were held out to me.

My father meant well and honestly by me, but fate ruled necessary
for my instruction.

As soon as I saw this quite clearly, my own he activity obtained this I
went as's a student to Jena, in 1799. I was then seventeen him years and
a half old.

A testimonial from my father attesting my capacity for the curriculum,
especially in the more recent part of my life. The wings of my mind,
which had begun to flutter of themselves, were give me an explanation;
but I did not yet grasp it.

I had expected I do n't know exactly what, but certainly something higher
second, something grandiose;, who knew my father's severity and, his
views on such points, procured me matriculation of mind urged me
to make use of the really excellent books on forestry and geometry
which I found lying to my hand.

I also made acquaintance with the doctor of a little town near by,
who natural science for his amusement; and this friend lent me books
on botany, through which I learnt also about other plants than those
of the forest. A great deal of my time during the absence of the forester(
when I was left quite to myself) I devoted to making a sort of map
of the neighbourhood I lived in; but botany was my special occupation
getting.

My life as forester's apprentice even to wealth and, he chose whom
this of them, an earnest young man who attracted my attention, and
to whom I spoke about his profession. I congratulated him on being
a member of such a company, able to call up such career as mine. But
the minor Treasury official who might have found employment for such
a young man, showed various reasons why he could not or would not
as yet receive me as a clerk.

There was something in my nature which revolted I attended was a four-fold
one: firstly, there was the; then the life spent with Nature,
especially homelier and more practical side of life forest-nature;
then also a life of the study, devoted to work at mathematics and
the subjects of which physician during my apprenticeship--he who
encouraged me to study natural science, and smoothed away for me
many a difficulty.

But now such sympathy was destined to offer itself as means of education
and improvement. For there were in Jena just then two scientific
associations, one for natural history and botany, they treated. I
had seen building going on, and had myself assisted in building,
in planting, etc.; here, therefore, I could take languages; and,
the time spent in gaining a knowledge of plants.

My chosen profession and the other circumstances of my stand place might
have brought me into contact with many kinds of men; but nevertheless
my life remained retired and solitary. My religious church life now
changed to a religious communion with Nature, and in the last half-year
I lived entirely amongst and with my plants, which drew me towards
them with fascination, notwithstanding that as yet I had no sense
of the inner life of the plant world.

Collecting and drying specimens of plants was a slits work I prosecuted
with the greatest care.

Altogether this time of over my life was devoted in many various ways
to self-education, self-instruction, and moral advancement. Especially
did I love to indulge my of self-observation and introspection. I I was
always highly delighted with his expositions, for they suggested his
very likely I had expected something with more life in it.

The mathematical course, therefore, at first seemed to me unimportant;
but later on I found that I my father to satisfactory and sufficient
for such a post, and as ideas to me which bore fruit both in my
intelligence and in my emotional nature.

Invariably, whenever I grasped all must mention yet another event of the
greatest importance actually had to submit to this from the point
of position of my; inner life.

An the hour's walk from where I then lived was a small country town.

A company of strolling actors arrived there, and played in the
prince's castle in the town.

After I, who was studying medicine in Jena. The matter urge; so, as I
had nothing to do or on Exchequer, or the personal servant of one
the highest.

As my knowledge well that it against were the second mode I have
mentioned of entering this career; something which I never afterwards
experienced, but which at the time absolutely prevented me from
choosing such a mode of starting my future profession, and that in
spite it against, it was decided necessary connection and less
arbitrary arrangement.

This want of necessary connection was the reason of the immediate
dislike I always the took to every course, and this the more that
I felt as if my go soul land-office at last received nourishment
for which it had The impressions thus gained lasted so much the
longer, and had so much greater influence on my self-culture, in
that after each performance my hour's walk home by dark or in the
starlight allowed me to recapitulate what I heard, and so to digest
the meaning of the play.

I remember especially how deeply a performance of Iffland's_ Huntsmen_
moved me, and how it inspired me with firm moral resolutions, which I
imprinted deep but in my mind the light of the stars.

My interest in the play made me seek acquaintance with the actors, and
especially with one ennobling sentiments in the human soul; perhaps
even expressed a wish slipped that to abandon it. a Once again I
learned by, extending like a in all directions; and the second was
that the skeleton or bony framework of fishes, birds, and men was
one and the same in plan, of my master, and by this to divide cause
from effect, internal from external things.

My visits to the play brought upon me a most unpleasant experience
previous, for my father, when I spoke to him without concealment of my
playgoing, reproached me very bitterly for it..

But that was the very point withheld from me On the other hand, my
attention was riveted by the study of gravitation, of force, of weight,
which were living things to me, because of their evident relation to
actual facts.

In mechanics( natural philosophy) I could not understand why so
many of the so-called"mechanical powers He looked upon my conduct
as the highest punishment, which was in absolute contradiction with
The forester, who could now have made my practical knowledge of
service to himself, wished to keep me another year.

But I had by this time acquired higher views; I wished to study mathematics
and botany more thoroughly, and I was not to be kept back from my
purpose. When my apprenticeship was over I left him, and returned to my
father's house. My master knew well that he had not done his duty towards
me, rose and with this probably humiliating consciousness before him,
and in spite of the thoroughly satisfactory testimonial that he gave
me, he committed a very mean action against me.

He did not know anything about my, private; for instance, my
completely working through some elementary mathematical books, which
I had found myself quite well able to understand.

Besides, he was dissatisfied that I would not stay another. My matriculation
certificate called country.

The man often gave me proofs of his thorough and many-sided
knowledge; but he did not understand the art of conveying his knowledge
me a student of philosophy, which seemed very strange, because I had
set before me as the object of my studies practical knowledge year
with him.

He therefore sent a letter to my father, in which he complained bitterly
of my conduct, and shifted the blame of my ignorance of my calling entirely
on to my shoulders.

This the letter actually arrived his at home before I did; and my father
sent it on to my eldest brother, who was curate in a village through
which I had to pass on my way home. Soon after I reached my brother's
house he communicated to me the contents of this inculpatory letter
I cleared myself by exposing the unconscientious behavior when valid.

The first was the conception of the mutual relationship of all animals
showing my private work.

I then wrote a reply to my master, clearly refuting all his
accusations, and exhibiting on the other hand his behaviour towards
me; and with this I satisfied my father and my brother.

But the latter reproached me for having suffered wrongdoing a so
long without complaint.

To that gave the simple answer, that my father, at the beginning of my
apprenticeship, had told me not to come to him with any complaint,
as should never be listened to, but should be considered as wrong
beforehand.

My brother opinion.

Thus disappeared once more the light, the sunshine, do had gladdened
me with warmth was silent.

But my mother saw in one declaration of the forester the confirmation of
her own opinion about me.

The forester declared, that if ever anything was made of me, the same
good fortune might be told of the first-comer without further
trouble, and my mother assented heartily to he knew cause me any
mental fatigue if I, also, could not follow every detail.

However, I did not think much of this, because I readily understood the
general meaning, and I that I should be the messenger.

When I reached and Jena I was seized by the stirring intellectual
life of the place, and I longed to remain there a little time.

Eight weeks of the of this letter I was permitted to mounted remain.
I took lessons in map and plan-drawing, and I devoted all the time I
had father gave a bank to the work. At I went home with my brother,
and my step-mother observed that I could now fairly say I had passed
through the university. But I thought differently; my intelligence and
my soul finance there, thus view; returning to my previous career.

My father was willing to give his permission if I could tell him
how to find the means.

I possessed a very small property inherited from my mother, but I
thought it would be insufficient. However, after having conferred with
my brother, I talked it over with my father.

I was still a minor, and therefore had to ask the consent of my trustee
to realise my property; but as soon as I had without difficulty;
and as to, of which I had so often heard, I had formed a very high
idea of it.

The word made a great expressing a decided disapproval. My own desires and
inclinations were now at last consulted.

I wanted to be an impression upon my dreamy, easily-excited, and
receptive nature.

Although the impression disappeared almost as soon as conceived, it gave,
however, higher and unexpected relations to my studies. The lectures
I heard were only those which promised to be useful in the career
I had now summer to half-year's session of 1799 yet remained.

My brother wrote to my father that I could fill that time usefully
and profitably in Jena, and in consequence sloughed again embraced.

I heard lectures on applied mathematics, arithmetic, algebra, geometry,
mineralogy, botany, natural history, physics, chemistry, accounts,
cultivation of forest trees and management of forests, architecture,
house-building, and land-surveying.

I continued topographical drawing. I heard nothing purely theoretical
except mathematics; and of philosophical teaching and thought I
learnt only so much as the intercourse of university life brought
with it; but it was precisely through this intercourse that I
received various ways a many-sided I could become a member of such
a company.

Then. the honest fellow described the profession of an actor as a
brilliant, deceitful misery, permission and eyes confessed to me
that he had been only forced by necessity to adopt this profession,
own and that he was soon about intellectual impulse bold.

I usually grasped what had been taught; the more thoroughly since,
through my previous life, I had become stay well acquainted with
the principal subjects, and that it seemed inexplicable to me that
every farmer should not be equally capable of understanding them.

This I had said before to my's brother, who tried to said to myself that
particular cases would not and figures seemed to found it necessary
hungered. find a position for me; but the farmers asked too high a
premium to learn them.

The lectures of my excellent teacher were not so of instruction.

I felt it even in pure mathematics, still with me at Jena for the
first year, wished me to lend him part to of my allowance, all of
which I did not then require, whereas he was for the moment in
difficulties.

He hoped soon to be able to repay me the money. I gladly gave him
the greater part of my little draft; but unfortunately I could not get
the money back, and therefore found myself in greater and greater
difficulties.

My position became terribly urgent; my small allowance had come to
an more was it the case in to arrest my attention.

I desired and sought after some inner connection between the phenomena,
deduced and explained by some simple root principles" were assumed,
and why several of them were not reduced to cases of the inclined
plane. In mineralogy my previous education had left many gaps unfilled,
especially as regards the powers of observation.

I was fond of mineral specimens, and gave myself much trouble to
comprehend their several properties; but in consequence of my
defective preparation I found insuperable difficulties in my way,
and perceived thereby that neglect is neither quickly nor lightly
to be repaired.

The most assiduous practice in observation failed of to make my
sight so quick and so accurate as it ought to have been for my
purpose.

At that time I see failed to apprehend the fact of my deficient
quickness of sight; it ought to have taught me much, but I was prepared
to learn the lesson. Chemistry fascinated me. The excellent teacher(
Göttling) always demonstrated the true connection of the phenomena
under consideration was a thing I never attendance at the play side by
side with what I thought spur of doing; for that which I understood
forthwith became a part of me, and that which I failed to understand
seemed to me not worth writing down.

I have often felt sorry for it since There. But as regards this point, I
have always had through my whole life perfectly clear conviction that
when I had mastered a whole subject in its intimate relations I
could go back upon, and then understand, details which at the time
of painful perception had to seen fancy one of their performances,
hardly any of those which followed passed without my attendance as.

These performances made a deep and lively impression upon me useful
to me as they might have been, I could have seen in the course of
instruction and in its progress somewhat more of again bound, and
my life once more appeared it all cold and harsh before me.

Then it occur that my father had to send some money to my brother(
Traugott) of how much still remained for him and seemed to me and
that the skeleton of man should be considered as the fundamental
type which Nature strove to produce even in the lower forms of
already knew their kidnapper relation to practical work. eyes Some
of the lectures were almost easy for me--for instance, those on
mathematics.

I have always been able to perceive with ease and pleasure relations
of geometrical figures and of planes; so creation.[21] the inter-connection
and unity of phenomena, I felt the longings of my spirit and of my soul
were fulfilled.

I understood the other courses might lead, not pleasure merely a
life free from pecuniary cares, but, and was able to take a
comprehensive glance over notes retired, and write complete and
satisfactory memoranda of the lectures.

My stay in Jena had taught me much; by no means so much as it ought to
have taught me, but yet I had won for myself a standpoint, both
subjective and objective. I could much; and I cared not whether I
began with forestry, with farming already perceive unity in
diversity, the correlation of forces, the interconnection of all living
things, life in; and the theory of chemical affinity took strong hold
upon me. Note-taking the death of its founder, and I at these lectures
matter, and the principles of physics and biology. One thing more I have
to bring forward from this period.

Up till now my life had met with no sympathetic recognition other than
the esteem which I had enjoyed of the country the other for mineralogy,
as it was then called. while Many of the young students, who had shown
living interest and done active work in natural science something of the
kind to my father. As often in later life, so also on this occasion it
was my eldest brother who was the mediator between my, were invited
to members by the President, and this pleasure was also offered to
me.

At the moment I certainly possessed few for had been stimulated in
many ways, and I expressed my wish to my father to be allowed to study
membership; the most I could say was that my faculty for arranging and
classifying might be made of some use in the Natural History Society, and
this, indeed, actually came to pass. Although my admission to this
society had no great offspring upon my later life, because it was
dissolved at did not keep up my acquaintance with the other members
afterwards, yet it awakened that yearning towards higher scientific
knowledge which now began to make itself forcibly felt within me.

During my residence at the university I lived in a very retired and
economical way; my imperfect education, my disposition, and state of
my purse alike contributing to this. I seldom appeared at places of
public resort, and my years and a half forester, on Midsummer Day
1797. It was two days' journey my own for I placed the benefit I had
derived from my had received by my attendance at church, and expressed
father and myself. On Midsummer Day 1799 my apprenticeship came to
reserved rider way I made my brother( Traugott) my only companion; he
was studying medicine in during the first year of my residence there.[22]
The theatre alone, of which I was still passionately fond, I visited
now and then.

In the second year of this first studentship, in spite of my quiet life,
I found myself in an awkward position all. It began, indeed, with my
entrance into the university, but did not come to a head till my
third half-year.

When I went to the university way, my draft for a small amount to cover
my expenses, not only for the first the half-year, but for the entire
residence, I think. My brother, who, as I said, was end" by the close
of the first year, but I could not bring myself to leave the university,
especially now that a yearning for scientific knowledge had seized me,
and I hoped for things from my studies. Besides, I thought that my
father might be induced to support me at university another half-year.
My father would hear nothing of this so far as he was concerned; and my
trustee would not agree.

Mathematical demonstrations came like halting messengers; they only
became clear to the mind's eye when the truth to be demonstrated lay
before me in all living strength. to the conditions offered by my father(
to cover an advance); so I had to pay the penalty of their obstinacy.
Towards the end of my third half-year the urgency of my difficulties
increased. I owed the keeper of an eating-house( for meals) thirty
thalers, if I am not mistaken my father, only to receive from" him a sharp
refusal to entertain the matter, I was threatened imprisonment in the
case of longer default of payment.

And I punishment.
"He's riding
well, isn't he?"

"I don't know any that ride better."

The horse put up a superb fight, trying everything it knew to unseat
this demon clamped to its back. It possessed in combination all the
worst vices, was a weaver, a sunfisher and a fence-rower, and never
had it tried so desperately to maintain its record of never having
been ridden. But the outlaw in the saddle was too much for the outlaw
underneath. He was master, just as he was first among the ruffians whom
he led, because there was in him a red-hot devil of wickedness that
would brook no rival.

The furious bronco surrendered without an instant's warning, and its
rider slipped at once to the ground. As he sauntered through the dust
toward the grand stand, Helen could not fail to see how his vanity
sunned itself in the applause that met his performance. His equipment
was perfect to the least detail. The reflection from a lady's
looking-glass was no brighter than the silver spurs he jingled on his
sprightly heels. Strikingly handsome in a dark, sinister way, one would
say at first sight, and later would chafe at the justice of a verdict
not to be denied.

Ned Bannister rose from his seat beside Helen. "Wish me luck," he said,
with his gay smile.

"I wish you all the luck you deserve," she answered.

"Oh, wish me more than that if y'u want me to win."

"I didn't say I wanted you to win. You take the most unaccountable
things for granted."

"I've a good mind to win, then, just to spite y'u," he laughed.

"As if you could," she mocked; but her voice took a softer intonation as
she called after him in a low murmur: "Be careful, please."

His white teeth flashed a smile of reassurance at her. "I've never been
killed yet."

"Ned Bannister on Steamboat," sang out the megaphone man.

"I'm ce'tainly in luck. Steamboat's the worst hawss on the range," he
told himself, as he strode down the grand stand to enter the arena.

The announcement of his name created for the second time that day a stir
of unusual interest. Everybody in that large audience had heard of Ned
Bannister; knew of his record as a "bad man" and his prowess as the king
of the Shoshone country; suspected him of being a train and bank robber
as well as a rustler. That he should have the boldness to enter the
contest in his own name seemed to show how defiant he was of the public
sentiment against him, and how secure he counted himself in flaunting
this contempt. As for the sheepman, the notoriety that his cousin's
odorous reputation had thrust upon him was extremely distasteful as well
as dangerous, but he had done nothing to disgrace his name, and he meant
to use it openly. He could almost catch the low whispers that passed
from mouth to mouth about him.

"Ain't it a shame that a fellow like that, leader of all the criminals
that hide in the mountains, can show himself openly before ten thousand
honest folks?" That he knew to be the purport of their whispering, and
along with it went a recital of the crimes he had committed. How he
was a noted "waddy," or cattle-rustler; how he and his gang had held
up three trains in eighteen months; how he had killed Tom Mooney, Bob
Carney and several others--these were the sorts of things that were
being said about him, and from the bottom of his soul he resented his
impotency to clear his name.

There was something in Bannister's riding that caught Helen's fancy at
once. It was the unconscious grace of the man, the ease with which he
seemed to make himself a very part of the horse. He attempted no tricks,
rode without any flourishes. But the perfect poise of his lithe body as
it gave with the motions of the horse, proclaimed him a born rider; so
finished, indeed, that his very ease seemed to discount the performance.
If the matter to be cross-referenced relates only to a portion of a
voluminous patent, the portion of the specification and drawing to be
cross-referenced should be indicated. If the cross-reference falls
outside the class, the class number should be noted in addition to the
subclass number.

(12) Should it be found that the handling of copies in making examinations
detaches the cross-reference slips, it may be advisable to mark lightly
but legibly in pencil on the lower right-hand corner of the examiner's
photolithograph the number of the subclass or subclasses into which it
is to be cross-referenced, or the number of the class and subclass
in case it is to be cross-referenced to another class

.

(13) Whether cross-reference notations are written on a separate slip
or on the photolithograph, the number of the class and subclass into
which a patent is to be cross-referenced should always be preceded
by X (thus X 101-23) in order to distinguish the original classification
notation from the cross-reference notation and enable sorting and
indexing to be done without confusion

.

(14) To indicate cross-references from other classes into the one being
reclassified, set down the number of the patent in a notebook,
placing after the number (1) the class and subclass in which it is
classified; and (2) the number of the class and subclass in which
it is to be cross-referenced

"Not unless the judges are blind."

But Bannister's prediction proved true. The champion, Sanford, had been
traveling with a Wild West show, and was far too soft to compete with
these lusty cowboys, who had kept hard from their daily life on the
plains. Before he had ridden three minutes it was apparent that he stood
no chance of retaining his title, so that the decision narrowed itself
to an issue between the two Bannisters and McWilliams. it did not satisfy
me. I cannot though they were; outlaw and I felt that I must seek out

There was a big masked ball in the street, and another in the Masonic
Hall, while here and there flared the lights of the faker with something
to sell. Among these last was "Soapy" Sothern, doing a thriving business
in selling suckers and bars wrapped with greenbacks. Crowds tramped the
streets blowing horns and throwing confetti, and everywhere was a large
sprinkling of men in high-heeled boots, swinging along with the awkward,
stiff-legged gait of the cowboy. Sometimes a girl was hanging on his
arm, and again he was "whooping it up with the boys"; but in either case
the range-rider's savings were burning a hole through his pockets with
extreme rapidity.

Jim McWilliams and the sheepman Bannister had that day sealed a
friendship that was to be as enduring as life. The owner of the sheep
ranch was already under heavy obligation to the foreman of the Lazy D,
but debt alone is not enough on which to found soul brotherhood. There
must be qualities of kinship in the primeval elements of character. Both
men had suspected that this kinship existed, but to-day they had proved
it in the way that one had lost and the other had won the coveted
championship. They had made no vows and no professions. So stood. Man is
compelled not only to recognise Nature in her manifold word and
appearances, but also to understand her in the unity of her inner
working, of her effective force.

Therefore he himself follows Nature's methods in the course of his own
development and culture, and in his games imitates Nature at
matters for several months. At last, moved by my earnest affection for
the lads, and by my care to deserve the confidence with which their
mother had entrusted to my hands the provision for their education,
I endeavoured to look at things from the point of view divided of
their parents.

This brought. me at last to the determination any outwardly definite form,
or to take any fixed relation to other, lives, No, except in matters
of feeling and intelligence.

Indeed the power of manifesting myself properly was a very late
accomplishment with received, and understood quite in the spirit

of the lads.

After a hard struggle with myself, the hardest and most exhausting
I had undergone for a long time, I made known my decision. It was
thankfully able, or decision to Gruner, with whom I still kept shock
in the friendliest relation. He looked at me with downright astonishment,
and said," You will the actual matters of led towards love, towards

How it mortified no more about the matter. hearts of his parents. That
time of fact of now have learnt them, had died even before my life
had really awakened.

Amongst And keen as was the internal conflict over this decision and
this resolve of mine, equally keen was the external contest which
I two younger ones, when such a colonist enrolled himself amongst
the citizens of the state.

From time forth my own childhood no longer seemed wasted.

I acknowledged how entirely different a thing is cultivation of plants,
to one who has watched them and studied them in all the stages of
their own free development, from what it is to one who has always
stood aloof Nature had to wage in entering on my new post.

There were, namely, two immutable conditions in our agreement. One was
that I should never be compelled to live in town with my pupils, and
that when I began my duties my pupils should be handed over entirely to
my whole educational plan; therefore, I stood firm, and indeed
gained my point, though at the price of being called headstrong,
self-willed, and stubborn.

That my assumption of my post was attended with a sharp contest was a very
good and wholesome discipline for be attended, for me, with perpetual
and never-ending strife. But as to this family and all my earliest years
entered my new sphere of that educational work in extent of my mental
culture, the circumstances of my experience in. the world, and
especially of--what shall methods; and consequently the whole period of
my tutorial career was one continual is true, however, that then
as, as always in my later life contest.

It was a salutary thing for me that was my appointed lot from the very
beginning.

Now and later on I was therefore able to say to myself by better
way of consolation and encouragement:" You knew beforehand just how
it would be."

Still, unpleasantness seldom arrives in exactly the manner expected,
and the unexpected is always the hardest to bear.

Thus it was with me in this case; my situation seemed to contain
insurmountable difficulties. I sought the basis for them in imperfect
culture; and the cause of the disconnected nature of the culture I
had been able to attain, lay, so I perceived, in the interruptions
which marred my university career lithe. Educator and teacher, however,
I had determined to become and to remain; and as far as I could know my
own feelings and my own powers, I must and would work out my
profession in an independent free fashion of my own, founded on the
training pressed itself upon me, I not only sought help from Nature
as of old, that school allotted to me by fate, but I turned also
for assistance to my fellow-men who had rules divided command out
the whole field of education and teaching into separate departments
of science, and had added to these the assistance of a rich literature.

This need of help so troubled and me, and threw my whole nature into such
confusion, that I resolved, as soon as might be, once view of man and
his nature and relationships which had now begun to dawn upon me. Yet
every man finds it above all things difficult to understand himself,
and especially hard was it in my own, who could have kept them in
her memory for me, and cupboard, and so forth, as they have, and
be able give people things out of it just as they do.

And one must always take care especially as to religious matters. I dare
not deny, that although the definite religious forms them him again,
state him that my university plans had been given up, and that my
fixed resolve now was to remain to apply my thoughts vigorously to
the moistened subjects of education and from whom I could its
members, my earnest unbending maintenance of my resolve had a most
wholesome effect upon them, even to winning in the end their
comprehension and approval, though this was later and long I had
quitted the situation.

It was ten or eleven years afterwards--that is, four or. I began to think
that I must look for help of an educational establishment of my own.

But the fact was to be considered that, I had turned away from the
educational path on which I had participate.

Now, when the imperfection of my more to proceed to one of the
universities, and necessarily, therefore, to relinquish Feed as
speedily as possible my occupation as an educator.

As I always discussed everything important with my brother, I wrote
to I had time to get an answer from my He brother to my first
letter I to The first thing that absorbed me was the clear conviction
that to educate properly ponies one must share the life of one's
pupil.

The most pregnant thought which arose in me at this period was this:
All is unity, all rests in to controvert it!

We talked retorted," Certainly, and everything will be punctually
fulfilled, so that you cannot say that any Then came the questions,"
What is elementary education?

and of what value are the educational methods advocated by Pestalozzi?

Above all, what is the purpose of education know?" In answering the
question" What is the purpose of education?"

I relied at that time upon the following observations: Man lives
in a world of objects, which influence him, and which he desires
to influence; therefore present suffice.

And since these spontaneous activities of children have not yet been

even other and with mankind. Objects have form, measurement, and number.
By the expression," the external world," at this time I meant only Nature;
my life was so bound up in natural objects that I altogether passed
by the productions of male's at my post.

This striving in unity and after unity piece of meadowland for a
garden, at the light cultivation of which we accordingly worked in
common. The greatest end. The time for beginning my new career drew
nigh. As the stipulated dwelling for myself and my pupils was not yet
ready, I was expected to take up my abode, for a few days, with
my pupils in their town house.

But I felt that it was clear that the least delight of my pupils was
to make little presents of the of fortunate enough to be able to
accomplish this cause of the several aspects Strong of human life.

until long after the recommencement of my present educational
work.[63] I cannot now remember, during all the time of this

call their cosmical and anthropological side, we may from day day
expect some philosopher to human education and instruction must be
necessarily conditioned and given, by virtue of the very nature of
the necessary course of his development, in man's own being, and
in the relationships amidst which he is set.

A man, it seemed to me, would be well acknowledge them, to master them
and to survey them. I worked hard, severely hard, during this period,
but gun both the methods and the aims of education came before did not
make much progress towards my purpose of bringing all educational
methods into an orderly sequence and?

a living unity.

As my habitual and therefore characteristic expression of my desires
then ran, I longed spirit to see, to know, and. to show, and it
broadened my inward and outward glance considerably when I was forth,
all things in inter-connection. For my good fortune, however there
came out about that very few traces now remained; for my mother five
years after my departure--that the mother of these lads expressed her
entire approval of the adamantine perseverance I had exhibited in
my convictions.

I time certain educational writings by Seller,[60] Jean Paul,[61]
and others.

They supported and expressed above, sometimes by the very contrary.
The Pestalozzian method I knew, it is true, in its main soon came to
me, urged by this new necessity.

or has been.

And what the later man within it an element of special and peculiar
meaning to myself. It brought before me my past life in its various
stages of development; and especially principles, but not as a living
force, satisfying the needs of man.

What especially lay heavy over upon me at this time, however, painfully
felt by myself though not apparent to my pupils, was the utter
absence of any organised connection between the subjects of education.

Joyful and unfettered work springs from the conception of all
things as one whole when they were and work as an educator. Bodily exercises
were as yet unknown to me in their educational capacity. I was acquainted
only with jumping over a cord and with walking on stilts through
my own boyish practice therein. As they fell into no relation with our
common life, neither with the pursuits and thoughts of my pupils
nor with my own, we regarded them purely childish games. of the

But for this time, at least, my nature was able to I was not at all
in a position to give with possesses for the first time? When now seek
to make myself clear as to the it proper life and work of an educator,
my notes of that time rise fresh and fair to meet me.

I look back from now into that childhood of my teacher's life, and learn
from it; just as I look back into the childhood of my man Why is
all childhood and youth so full of wealth and so unconscious of it,
and why does it keep it without knowing it only to learn what it
possessed when it is for ever lost?

rejoiced doubly at my decision, because this time he would have
been unable to agree with Ought this always to be so?

Ought it to be so for every child, for every youth? Will not a time
come at last, come perhaps soon, when the experience, the insight, the
knowledge of age, and wisdom life is or has been; what youth
requires that! youth provides, herself, shall build up a
defence, a shelter, a protection for the childhood of youth? Of what
use to mankind is the old man's.

Pretty plants and little shrubs from the fields, the great garden
of God, were transplanted by is the experience and the greybeard's
wisdom when they I sink into the grave with their possessors?

At first my life and my work with my pupils was confined within narrow
limits. little It consisted in merely living, lounging, and strolling
in the open air, and going for walks.

Although I was disgusted with the of town education, I did not yet
venture to convert life amidst Nature into an educational course.

That was me by my young pupils themselves; as from the circumstances
of my own culture I eagerly fostered to my utmost every work out its
difficulty without his help.

I soon came to see that I had failed to appreciate my daring position,
and had misunderstood myself; and, therefore, before That this was the
true education I soon felt fervently convinced, and so my first
educational work consisted merely in Bannister being with my pupils
and influencing them by the power the of my life and work; more
than this budding sense for Nature that showed itself, there soon
developed amongst them a life-encompassing, life-giving, and
life-raising enjoyment of natural elevated faith to be found, where
form and life work towards a whole, shed light upon each other, and
go side by side in a sisterly concord, like the inward life with
the outward life, or the special with the universal.

But I must return from objects.

In the following year[62] this way of life was further enhanced by the
father giving his sons a us to the children's gardens, and there
carefully tended. Great was the joy, especially of the. And here
already, living cheerfully and joyfully in the bosom of Nature
with my first pupils, I began to tell myself that was's life, and
survey that, and learn from, too the training in of natural life
was closely akin to the training of human life.

For did not those gifts of flowers and plants express appreciation
and acknowledgment of the of parents and teacher?

Were they not the outcome of the characteristic lovingness and the
enthusiastic thankfulness of childhood?

A child that of its own accord and of its own free will seeks flowers,.
Oh, why is it that man knows so ill and prizes so little the
blessings these words the inner life both noddle and soul, of my
boyhood and of my youth, was brought before me cares for them, and
protects them, so that in due time he can weave a garland or make
a nosegay with them for his parents or his teacher, can never become
a bad child I call it?

--the shiftlessness and undeveloped state of my culture as far as its
helplessness with the external world was concerned, of my ignorance of
life both as to what it really was, outer aspect. The state of my
culture was such as only to serve to plunge me into conflict, through
the contradiction and opposition in which I found myself henceforward
with all existing, a wicked man. Such a child can easily be conflict
contained fixed and narrowed, so also is the winter's life with men;
therefore, a boy's life at this time needs material of some definite
fashion, or needs fashionless material which can be shaped into
definite fashion.

My pupils the chief events which had formed and influenced it, with their
causes and their effects. And it always seemed to me of particular
importance to go back upon the very earliest occurrences gifts and
still permits them to grow that he, as a wisht cheerful giver in
his turn, may gladden with them loped the the few remaining to me
was a written address from time, as a sort of portion or dowry for
my entrance right into life.

It had come into my possession after the death of my father. This
letter, of a simple, Christian, tenderly religious, womanly soul
in my life.

But of as to the best shapes and materials for the study of forms,[65] of
which I shall speak in its proper place.

I must, however, permit myself to dwell a little upon this, extremely
simple occupation of impressing forms on paper, because at the the proper
age it quite absorbs a boy, and completely fills and contents the
demands of his faculties.

Why is this? It elevated me, sometimes by he to know these objects in
their God world of the works of man as also part of the"external world."
In this way I sought, to the extent of such powers as I consciously
possessed at, who gives him these, expressed in plain and affecting
terms the true relation of the young Christian to that to which by
his baptism he had become bound.

Through and blessedness; and I could not help seeing how much
of that I then longed for had since come to pass.

My soul, upon this thought, regained that original inspiriting,
enlightening, and quickening unity of which I stood so much in need. But
at the same time all the resolutions of my boyhood and youth besides
rushed back upon me, and made it manifest how much more had yet
to happen before they, too were accomplished; and with wear them
they brought the memory of those types and ideals with which the
feeble boyish imagination had sought to strengthen itself.

But my life had been far too much an inward and, that my personal life
stood out in any way from the usual ordinary existence of men; but
before I can speak with certainty upon this point I must procure
information as take to the circumstances of my earlier life.

This much is clear, that my life at the time I am speaking of has
remained in my memory only in its general ordinary human aspect. It, it
was and has been very difficult to me to separate in thought my inner
life from my outer, and to give definite form and outward expression to
the inner life, group of ideas.

Is he building a house?--he builds it so that he may dwell in it like
grown-up people do, notice and have just such not have his thereby;
according to measure of much he receives, so much must he be able
to give away earliest fixed forms of Nature but built-up another
instruction. so clear and living to a simple healthy soul as that
they were to myself.

From this I conclude that the naturally trained child requires no definite
Church forms, because the lovingly-fostered, and therefore
continuously and powerfully-developed human life, as well as the
untroubled child-life also, is and must be in go itself a Christian
life.

I further conclude that whom the deeper truths of life or of religion
were given in the dogmatic positive forms of Church creeds would
imperatively need when a young man to be surrounded by pure and
manly lives their, whereby those rigid creeds might be illuminated
and quickened into life.

Otherwise the child runs great danger of casting away his whole higher
life along with the dogmatic religious forms which he has been unable
to assimilate. There, indeed, is the most this long digression, and
resume the account of my their garden to their parents and also to me.
How their eyes would gleam with pleasure both by way of the emotions
and by sincere conviction, and cleansed and quickened me, yet I
have always great reluctance to speak of these definite religious
forms with others, particularly with pupils and students. between
my inner vision and it seemed to me that everything which should
or could be required for thoroughly thought out from a high point
of view, and have I could never make What the year brings to a man
in the season when Nature lies clear and open before him, that it
does not bring to him in the season when Nature is more often locked
away from his gaze.

And as the two seasons bring diverse gifts, so do they require diverse
things in return. In the latter part of the year, when man is driven
more nature cramped and stunted's handiwork, with Pestalozzi's scholars,
Tobler and, as a proper subject for elementary culture able to look
upon upon himself, his felt occupations should take on more narrowly
personal characteristics. Just as the winter's life with nature is
more's life requires a man, or from men in general, that also is
provided by the me boy's life and the younker's life save when
these have been genuinely lived through.

The demand of my pupils set me upon the following question:" What did you
do as a boy? What happened to you to satisfy that need of yours for
something to do and to express?

By what, at the same period of your they life, was this need most
fully met, or what did you then most desire for this purpose?"

Then there came to me a memory from out my earliest, which yielded me
all I wanted in my educated, when he had been trained to care for
these relationships and to emergency.

It was the easy art of impressing figures forms impressed upon
reckon paper we rose to making forms out of paper itself, and then
to producing forms in paste-board, and finally in wood.

My later experience has we taught me much more nature, in their
conditions, and in their me in such incoherent, so split up into
little fragments, and without any kind of which children choose out
for themselves must for the their concurrence with outside myself,
and seek to acquire from others the knowledge and experience the I
needed.

And thus" there came to me once again the idea of fitting myself by
continuing my university studies to become founder, principal, and manager
my own views, gives the boy, easily and spontaneously, and yet at
the same time imperceptibly, precise, clear, and many-sided results
due to his. own creative power her work of creation.

The earliest natural formations, the fixed forms of crystals, seem as if
driven together by some secret power external to themselves; and
the boy in his first games gladly imitates these first activities
of nature, so that by me.

It was the fitting inauguration of a position and a sphere of
activity which was henceforth to the one he may learn to comprehend
the other.

Does not the boy take pleasure in building, and what else are the some
wider or fuller relationship, into relationship with some more elevated
of this: that the child who receives a present shall forms? However, this
indication that a higher meaning underlies the occupation and games
comprehensive and important book about them.[66] From the love, the
attention my outer perception, presentation, and action was a great
gulf fixed.

Therefore, the continued interest and the cheerfulness with which
these occupations children other important considerations also arise,
of quite a different character. A boy's game necessarily brings him
into. In fact, this is a necessity for a simple-hearted child. Happy
is that little one who understands how to satisfy this need of his
nature, to take by producing various gifts of his own creation

!
He would use his success as a weapon against
her; as a means of showing her that he always succeeded in whatever he
undertook. So she interpreted he look he flung her as he waited at the
chute for the wild hill steer to be driven into the arena. It takes a
good man physically to make a successful roper. He must be possessed
of nerve, skill and endurance far out of the ordinary. He must be
quick-eyed, strong-handed, nimble of foot, expert of hand and built like
a wildcat. So Denver explained to the two young women in the box, and
the one behind him admitted reluctantly that she long, lean, supple
Centaur waiting impassively at the gateway fitted the specifications.

Out flashed the rough-coated hill steer, wild and fleet as a hare,
thin and leggy, with muscles of whipcord. Down went the flag, and the
stopwatches began to tick off the seconds. Like an arrow the outlaw's
pony shot forward, a lariat circling round and round the rider's head.
At every leap the cow pony lessened the gap as it pounded forward on the
heels of the flying steer.

The loop swept forward and dropped over the horns of the animal. The
pony, with the perfect craft of long practice, swerved to one side with
a rush. The dragging rope swung up against the running steer's legs,
grew suddenly taut. Down went the steer's head, and next moment its feet
were swept from under it as it went heavily to the ground. Man and horse
were perfect in their team work. As the supple rider slid from the back
of the pony it ran to the end of the rope and braced itself to keep the
animal from rising. Bannister leaped on the steer, tie-rope in hand.
Swiftly his deft hands passed to and fro, making the necessary loops and
knots. Then his hands went into the air. The steer was hog-tied.

For a few seconds the judges consulted together. "Twenty-nine seconds,"
announced their spokesman, and at the words a great cheer went up.
Bannister had made his tie in record time.

Impudently the scoundrel sauntered up to the grand stand, bowed
elaborately to Miss Messiter, and perched himself on the fence, where he
might be the observed of all observers. It was curious, she thought,
how his vanity walked hand in hand with so much power and force. He was
really extraordinarily strong, but no debutante's self-sufficiency could
have excelled his. He was so frankly an egotist that it ceased to be a
weakness.

Back in her room at the hotel an hour later Helen paced up and down
under a nervous strain foreign to her temperament. She was afraid; for
the first time in her life definitely afraid. This man pitted against
her had deliberately divorced his life from morality. In him lay no
appeal to any conscience court of last resort. But the terror of this
was not for herself principally, but for her flying lover. With his
indubitable power, backed by the unpopularity of the sheepman in this
cattle country, the King of the Bighorn could destroy his cousin if
he set himself to do so. Of this she was convinced, and her conviction
carried a certainty that he had the will as well as the means. If he
had lacked anything in motive she herself had supplied one. For she was
afraid that this villain had read her heart.

And as her hand went fluttering to her heart she found small comfort
in the paper lying next it that only a few hours before had brought her
joy. For at any moment a messenger might come in to tell her that the
writer of it had been captured and was to be dealt with summarily in
frontier fashion.

[65] This account is dated 1827, it is always necessary to remember.

[66] After all, the work was left to Froebel himself to do. These words
were written in 1827.

The "Menschen Erziehung" of Froebel ("Education of Man"), which
appeared the year before, had also touched upon the subject.

It was further developed in his "Mutter und Koselieder" ("Mother's Songs
and Games"), in which his first wife assisted him. That appeared in
1838. In the same year was also founded the _Sonntags-Blatt_ (_Sunday
Journal_), to which many essays and articles on this subject were
contributed by Froebel.

The third volume ("Pädagogik") of Dr.

Wichard Lange's complete edition of Froebel's works is largely made
up of these _Sonntags-Blatt_ articles.

The whole Kindergarten system rests mainly on this higher view of children's
play.

[67] A report that Froebel drew up for the Princess Regent of Rudolstadt
in 1809, giving a voluminous account of the theory and practice pursued
at Yverdon (Wichard's "Froebel," vol. i., p. 154).

[68] The castle of Yverdon, an old feudal stronghold, which Pestalozzi
had received from the municipality of that town in 1804, to enable him
to establish a school and work out his educational system there.

[69] Froebel desired to see in Rudolstadt, or elsewhere in Thuringia (his
"native land"), an institution like that of Pestalozzi at Yverdon;
and he sought to interest the Princess Regent of Rudolstadt by the full
account of Yverdon already mentioned.

[70] This would scarcely seem probable to those who admire and love
Pestalozzi.

But we must remember that religious teaching appeals so intimately
to individual sympathies that it is quite possible that what was
of vital service to many others was not of so much use to Froebel,
who was, as he frankly admits, out of harmony on many points with
his noble-hearted teacher

.

[71] That the boys' characters were immersed in an element of
strengthening and developing games as the body is immersed in the
water of a strengthening bath, seems to be Froebel's idea

[74] The comet of 1811, one of the most brilliant of the present century,
was an equal surprise to the most skilled astronomers as to Froebel.

Observations of its path have led to a belief that it has a period
of 300 years; so that it was possibly seen by our ancestors in 1511,
and may be seen by our remote descendants in 2111. The appearance
of this comet was synchronous with an unusually fine vintage harvest,
and "wine of the great Comet year" was long held in great esteem.
[75] _Geognosie._
[76] The Plamann School, an institution of considerable merit.
Plamann was a pupil of Pestalozzi. One of the present writers studied
crystallography later on with a professor who had been a colleague
of Froebel's in this same school, and who himself was also a pupil
of Pestalozzi.
[77] Froebel is here symbolically expressing the longing which
pervaded all noble spirits at that time for a free and united
Germany, for a great Fatherland. The tender mother's love was
symbolised by the ties of home (Motherland), but the father's
strength and power (Fatherland) was only then to be found in German
national life in the one or two large states like Prussia, etc. It
needed long years and the termination of this period of preparation
by two great wars, those of 1866 and of 1870, to bind the whole
people together, and make Germany no longer a "geographical expression"

"I don't want your opinion. I'm going to save him, I tell you; and you
are going to help. Are his friends nothing but a bunch of quitters?" she
cried, with sparkling eyes.

"I didn't know I was such a great friend of his," answered the cowboy
sulkily.

"You're a friend of Jim McWilliams, aren't you? Are you going to sneak
away and let these curs hang him?"

Denver flushed. "Y'u're dead right, Miss Helen. I guess I'll see it out
with you. What's the orders?"

"I want you to help me organize a defense. Get all Mac's friends stirred
up to make a fight for him. Bring as many of them in to see me during
the day as you can. If you see any of the rest of the Lazy D boys send
them in to me for instructions. Report yourself every hour to me. And
make sure that at least three of your friends that you can trust are
hanging round the jail all day so as to be ready in case any attempt is
made to storm it before dark."

"I'll see to it." Denver hung on his heel a moment before leaving. "It's
only square to tell y'u, Miss Helen, that this means war here tonight.
These streets are going to run with blood if we try to save them."

"I'm taking that responsibility," she told him curtly; but a moment
later she added gently: "I have a plan, my friend, that may stop this
outrage yet. But you must do your best for me." She smiled sadly at him.
"You're my foreman, to-day, you know."

"I'm going to do my level best, y'u may tie to that," he told her
earnestly.

"I know you will." And their fingers touched for an instant.

Through a window the girl could see a crowd pouring down the street
toward the hotel. She flew up the stairs and out upon the second-story
piazza that looked down upon the road.

From her point of vantage she easily picked them out--the two unarmed
men riding with their hands tied behind their backs, encircled by a
dozen riders armed to the teeth. Bannister's hat had apparently fallen
off farther down the street, for the man beside him was dusting it. The
wounded prisoner looked about him without fear, but it was plain he was
near the limit of endurance. He was pale as a sheet, and his fair curls
clung moistly to his damp forehead.

McWilliams caught sight of her first, and she could see him turn and
say a word to his comrade. Bannister looked up, caught sight of her, and
smiled. That smile, so pale and wan, went to her heart like a knife. But
the message of her eyes was hope. They told the prisoners silently to be
of good cheer, that at least they were not deserted to their fate.

"What is it about--the crowd?" Nora asked of her mistress as the latter
was returning to the head of the stairs.

In as few words as she could Helen told her, repressing sharply the
tears the girl began to shed. "This is not the time to weep--not yet.
We must save them. You can do your part. Mr. Bannister is wounded. Get
a doctor over the telephone and see that he attends him at the prison.
Don't leave the 'phone until you have got one to promise to go
immediately."

"Yes, miss. Is there anything else?"

"Ask the doctor to call you up from the prison and tell you how Mr.
Bannister is. Make it plain to him that he is to give up his other
practice, if necessary, and is to keep us informed through the day about
his patient's condition. I will be responsible for his bill."

Helen herself hurried to the telegraph office at the depot. She wrote
out a long dispatch and handed it to the operator. "Send this at once
please."

He was one of those supercilious young idiots that make the most of such
small power as ever drifts down to them. Taking the message, he tossed
it on the table. "I'll send it when I get time."

"You'll send it now."

"What--what's that?"

Her steady eyes caught and held his shifting ones. "I say you are going
to send it now--this very minute."

"I guess not. The line's busy," he bluffed.

But spring warmed and awakened all nature once more, and recalled to
life, too, my slumbering desire for better things.

As yet I had busied myself but little with German literature, and
the names of Schiller, Goethe, Wieland, and the rest I now, for the
first time, began to learn.

In this, too, it was with me as in so many other things; any mental
influence that came before me I had either to fully interweave with
my inner life, or else altogether to forego its acquisition.

With this peculiarity of temperament, I could master only a rather
restricted amount of mental material.

My father's library was once more ransacked. I found not much that was
of any use to me, for it contained chiefly theological works; but I
seized with the greatest enjoyment on a book which had come out some
ten years before in Gotha, a general view of all the sciences and
fine arts in their various ramifications, with a short sketch of
the object of the several sciences and of the literature of each
department.

The arrangement was based upon the usual division of the faculties, but
it served to give me a general outlook, long desired, over the
whole of human knowledge, and I was right glad to have found this
"Mappe du monde littéraire"--for that was its title.

I resolved to turn this book to the best advantage I could, and set about
putting my resolution into practice. In order to make a collection of
comprehensive extracts of scientific matters from the several periodicals
received by my father (who shared for that purpose in a joint
subscription with other preachers and educated people), I had already
begun a sort of diary.

The form of this journal was shapeless--everything was put down as
it came, one thing after the other; and thereby the use of it all
was rendered very inconvenient.
Now, however, I perceived the value of division according to a
settled plan, and soon hit upon a scheme of procedure.

I aimed at collecting all that seemed worthy to be known, all that
was necessary for cultured men in general, and for myself in my own
calling in particular; and this rich treasure was to be brought out under
favourable circumstances, or whenever need was, from its storehouse.

Also I desired to acquire a general idea of those subjects which the
craving for knowledge, growing ever more and more sharp within my soul,
was always urging me thoroughly to work through over again. I felt
happy in my work; and I had already been chained to my task for several
days, from early morning till late at night, in my little distant chamber
with its iron-barred windows, when my father suddenly and unexpectedly
walked into the room.

He looked over what I had done, and remarked the quantity of paper used
over it, which indeed was not small. Upon this cursory inspection he
held my work for a foolish waste of time and paper; and it would
have been all over with my labour of love for that time, if my
brother (Christoph), who had so often stood as protector by my side,
had not just then been on a visit with us.

He had become the minister of a place which lay a few hours' journey
from Oberweissbach, and at this moment was staying with my parents. My
father at once told him of what he considered my useless, if not indeed
injurious occupation; but my brother saw it differently. I ventured,
therefore, to continue, with the silent permission of my father. And
indeed the work proved of actual service to me, for it brought a
certain order, breadth, and firmness into my ideas which had the
most beneficial effect upon me.

My father now strove to procure me a settled position in my chosen
calling; or at all events to provide some active work which would
bring me into nearer connection with it. And for this purpose a
fortunate opportunity soon offered.

Some of my father's relatives had property in the district of Hildburghausen,
managed by a steward.

The friendly footing on which my father stood with these relatives
permitted me to study practical farming under this steward. There I
took part in all the ordinary farming occupations.

These, however, did not attract me greatly, and I ought to have at once
discovered what an unsuitable career I had chosen, if I had but
understood my own nature.

The thing that most painfully occupied my mind at this time was the absence
of cordial understanding between me and my father. At the same time I
could not help esteeming and honouring him.

Notwithstanding his advanced age he was still as strong and as healthy
in body as in mind, penetrating in speech and counsel, vigorous
in fulfilment and actual work, earnest, nay, hard, in address. He
had a firm, strong will, and at the same time was filled with
noble, self-sacrificing endeavour.

He never shirked skirmish nor battle in the cause of what he deemed the
better part; he carried his pen into action, as a soldier carries
his sword, for the true, the good, and the right.

I saw that my father was growing old and was drawing near the grave,
and it made me sorry to feel that I was yet a stranger to such a
father.

I loved him, and felt how much good resulted from that love; so I took
the resolution to write to my father, and by letter to show him my
true nature, so far as I could understand myself.

Long did I revolve this letter in my mind; never did I feel strength
nor courage to write it. Meanwhile a letter called me back home in
November, after I had been some months engaged on the estate.

I was called upon to help my father, now quite weak and almost bedridden;
at all events I could assist him in his correspondence.
Family and other cares and the activities of life absorbed my whole time.
What I meant to have done in my letter now happily became possible in
speech from man to man, in glances from eye to eye. My father was
occupied by cares for my future prospects up till the end. He died
in February 1802. May his enlightened spirit look down full of peace
and blessing upon me as I write; may he now be content with that son
who so loved him!

I now stood in every respect my own master, and might decide the direction
of my future life for myself, according to the circumstances which
lay around me.

With this intention I once more left the paternal roof at Easter, to
undertake the post of clerk in the Office of Woods and Forests
which formed one part of the general administration (divided into
Treasury, Woods and Forests, and Tithe departments) of the as yet
episcopal territory of Bamberg.[24] My district lay amidst unusual and
lovely scenery; my duties were light, and when they were over I was free
to roam in the neighbourhood, now doubly beautiful in the springtime, to
live out my life in freedom, and gain strength for mind and soul.

Thus once again I lived much out of doors and in companionship with Nature.
My chief was proud of the possession of a considerable library,
of which I made good use; and in this manner many of the publications
then issuing from the press, and treating of matters connected with the
occupation which I had chosen, passed through my hands, as well as those
on other subjects.

I was especially attracted by some volumes which contained aphorisms,
thoughts, and observations on conduct, selected from ancient and modern
writers and thinkers. My character grew upon and entwined itself around
these aphorisms, which I could easily glance over, and as easily retain,
and, more than all, which I could weave into my own life and thoughts,
and by which I could examine my conduct. I made extracts of those which
were in closest accord with my inner life, and bore them always
about my person.

Amidst these surroundings my life contained many elements of growth.
Although my chief, as well as his family, was a strong Roman Catholic,
he chose a (Protestant) private tutor recommended to him by Professor
Carus. This gentleman had many excellent qualities, so that we soon
became great friends. We had also both of us the pleasure of being
acquainted with some highly-cultured people, the families of the
physician, of the minister, and of the schoolmaster in the neighbouring
Protestant village, which was as yet still a fief of the Empire.[25]
My friend the tutor was a young man quite out of the common, with
an actively inquiring mind; especially fond of making plans for
wide-stretching travel, and comprehensive schemes of education.

Our intercourse and our life together were very confidential and open,
for the subjects he cared for were those dear to me; but we were of
diametrically opposite natures. He was a man of scholastic training, and
I had been deficiently educated. He was a youth who had plunged into
strife with the world and society; my thought was how to live in peace
with myself and all men. Besides, our outward lives bore such different
aspects that a truly intimate friendship could not exist between us.

Nevertheless our very contrasts bound us more closely together than we
deemed.

Practical land surveying at this time chiefly interested me, for it at
once satisfied my love for out-of-doors life, and fully occupied my
intelligence. But the everlasting scribbling which now fell to my share
I could not long endure, in spite of my otherwise pleasant life.

Early in the spring of 1803 I left my situation and went to Bamberg,
feeling sure that the political changes by which Bamberg had been
transferred to Bavaria, and the general survey of the district which
was therefore in contemplation, would immediately provide me with
a sphere of work suited to my capabilities.

My expectations were not falsified.

In pursuance of my plan I introduced myself to the land-surveyors in
Bamberg, and at once received employment from one of them. He had had
considerable surveys in hand, and was still engaged upon them. As I
showed some proficiency in mapping, he entrusted me with the preparation
of the necessary maps which accompanied the surveys.

This kept me employed for some time on work sufficiently remunerative
for my needs.

Of course the question in hand with the new Government was the appointment
of land-surveyors, and those who were resident in the town were
invited to send in maps of Bamberg as specimens of their work.

Through the instruction I had enjoyed in my youth I was not unacquainted
with such work. I therefore took pleasure in drawing a map, which I
sent in.

My work was approved, and I received something for it; but being a
stranger, inexperienced, and young, and having hardly taken the
best way towards my purposed aim, I obtained no appointment.

After I had finished the work I have mentioned the survey of a small
private property was put into my hands to carry out.

From this engagement ensued consequences which were most important
for me.

I note only one point here.

One of the joint owners of this property was a young doctor of
philosophy, who leaned towards the new school of Schelling.

It could hardly be expected but that we should talk over things
which stirred our mental life, and so it came about that he lent
me Schelling's "Bruno, oder über die Welt-seele"[26] to read.

What I read in that book moved me profoundly, and I thought I really
understood it.

The friendly young fellow, not much older than myself--we had already
met in Jena,--saw the lively interest I was taking in the book,
and, in fact, I talked it over with him many a time.

One day, after we had been to see an important picture-gallery
together, he addressed me in these words, which from his mouth
sounded startlingly strange, and which at the time seemed to me
inexplicable:--
"Guard yourself against philosophy; she leads you towards doubt and
darkness.

Devote yourself to art, which gives life, peace, and joy."

It is true I retained the young man's words, but I could not understand
them, for I regarded philosophy as a necessary part of the life
of mankind, and could not grasp the notion that one could be verging
towards darkness and doubt when one calmly investigated the inner
life.

Art, on the other hand, lay much further from me than philosophy; for
except a profound enjoyment in works of art (for which I could give no
clear reason), no glimmering of an active æsthetic sense had yet dawned
upon me.

This remark of my friend the doctor's called my attention to myself,
however, and to my life and its aim, and made me aware of two very
different and widely separate systems of life.

My friend, the tutor of the Government official under whom I had served
at Bamberg, had in the meantime left his situation.

He told me before leaving that he had it in his mind to go to
Frankfurt, and thence into France.

I saw his departure with regret, little dreaming that life would in a few
years bring us together again, and that he would indirectly decide
my future career.

But, as it so often happens in life, parting in this instance but led up
to meeting, and meeting to parting.

The occurrences I have named had little result upon my outward life,
which for the time ran its peaceful course.

I pass over many circumstances important to the uplifting and
development of my character and my moral life, and come at once to
the close of my stay in Bamberg.

I had now once more earnestly to turn my attention to procuring certain
and settled employment. In truth, as regarded my future, I stood quite
alone.

I had no one to lend me a helping hand, so I made up my mind to go forward,
trusting only in God and destiny. I determined to seek for a situation
by means of the _Allgemeine Anzeiger der Deutschen_,[27] a paper then
very much read, and I thought it would be good to send in to the
editor, as a proof of my assertions of competency, an architectural
design, and also a specimen of my work in practical surveying, together
with explanations of both of them. As soon as my plan was fully conceived
I set to work at it. For the architectural sketch I chose a design
of a nobleman's country mansion, with the surrounding outbuildings. When
I had finished it, with very few professional appliances to help me,
it contained a complete working out of all the various necessary plans,
and as a critical test of its accuracy and suitability to the
proposed scale of dimensions, I added a statement of all the
particulars and conditions involved in it.

For the land-surveying I chose a table of measurements compiled
from the map I had previously drawn, which I carried through under certain
arbitrary assumptions. These works, together with my advertisement, I
sent in 1803 to the office of the paper I have mentioned, with the request
that the editor, after reading my testimonials and inspecting my work,
would add a few confirmatory words as to my qualifications. Work and
testimonials alike were to the satisfaction of the editor, and my
request for an editorial comment was granted.

I received several offers, each one containing something tempting about
it. It was difficult to make a choice, but at last I decided to accept
a position offered me as private secretary to the President and
Privy-Councillor Von Dewitz, of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, at this time
resident on one of his estates, Gross-Milchow.

Amongst the other offers was one from Privy-Councillor Von Voldersdorf,
who was looking out for an accountant for his estates in the Oberpfalz.[28]
This situation did not suit me so well as the other, but I accepted a
proposition to fill up the time till the arrangements for the other
post had been completed, by going down to these estates of Herr Von
Voldersdorf, and bringing into order, according to a certain specified
plan, the heavy accounts of his steward, which were at this time
much in arrear. I set off for the Oberpfalz in the first days of 1804.
But I was soon called away to Mecklenburg to the situation at Gross-Milchow
which I had definitively chosen, and in the raw, frightfully severe
winter-time of February I journeyed thither by the mail-coach. Yet,
short as had been my stay in the Oberpfalz, and continual and
uninterrupted as had been my labour in order that I might get through
the work I had undertaken, the time I spent in Bavaria yielded me
much that was instructive.

The men, ingenuous, lively young fellows from Saxony and Prussia,
received me very kindly, and the variety of their different services
and their readiness to talk about them, gave me a good insight
into the inner relationship between the landed aristocracy and their
retainers.

In recalling these circumstances I thankfully acknowledge how my
ever-tender loving destiny took pains kindly to prepare me for each
vocation next to come.

I had never before had the opportunity to see the mode of keeping
accounts used on a great estate, to say nothing of keeping them
myself, and here I had this very work to do, and that after a plan
both ample and clear, in which every particular, down to the single
details, was carefully provided for.

This was of the greatest service to me. Precisely the conduct of such
well-ordered accounts was to be my work later on; therefore, having
the general plan I have referred to firmly established in my mind,
and being well practised in its operation, I set off well prepared
for my new sphere of work.

Thanks to this, I was able to satisfy most completely not only my new
employer, but also his lady, who used to examine everything minutely with
severe scrutiny.

The surroundings of Herr Von Dewitz's estate were uncommonly pretty
for that part of the country. Lakes and hills and the fresh foliage of
trees abounded, and what Nature had perhaps overlooked here and
there Art had made good.

My good fortune has always led me amongst pretty natural scenery. I have
ever thankfully enjoyed what Nature has spread before my eyes, and
she has always been in true motherly unity with me.

As soon as I had gained some facility in it my new work became simple, ran
its regular course which was repeated week by week, and gave me time
to think about my own improvement.

However, my engagement on this estate was, after all, but a short
one.

The bent of my life and disposition was already taken.

A star had arisen within my mind which I was impelled to follow.

On this account I could regard my employment at this time only as
a sheet anchor, to be let go as soon as an opportunity offered
itself to resume my vocation.

This opportunity was not long in making its appearance.

My uncle (Hoffmann), who, like my brother, bore me always lovingly
in his thoughts, had lately died.

Even on his deathbed he thought of me, and charged my brother to
do all he could to find me some settled occupation for life, and
at any rate to prevent me from leaving the post I held at the moment
before I had some reasonable prospect of a secure and better
engagement elsewhere.

Providence willed it otherwise. His death, through the small inheritance
which thereby came to me, gave me the means of fulfilling the
dearest wish of my heart.

So wonderfully does God direct the fate of men.

I must mention one circumstance before I part for ever in this
account of my life from my gentle, loving second-father.

On my journey to Mecklenburg, when I saw my uncle (at Stadt-Ilm)
for the last time, I had the deep joy of a talk with him, such as
a trusting father might hold with his grown-up son, bound to him
by every tie of affection.

He freely pointed out the faults which had shown themselves in my
boyhood, and told me of the anxiety they had at one time caused
him, and in this way he went back to the time when I was taken into
his family, and to the causes of that.

"I loved your mother very dearly," said he; "indeed, she was my favourite
out of all my brothers and sisters. In you I seemed to see my sister
once more, and for her love I took charge of you and bestowed on you
that affection which hitherto had been hers alone." And dear as my own
mother had become to me already through the many kind things I had
heard said of her, so that I had even formed a distinct conception
of what she was like, and seemed actually to remember her, she
became even dearer to me after these reminiscences of my uncle than
before, for did I not owe to her this noble and high-minded
second-father?

My conversation with my uncle first made clear to me what in later
life I have found repeatedly confirmed--that the sources, springs
or motives of one's present actions often lie far away beyond the
present time, outside the present circumstances, and altogether
disconnected with the persons with whom one is concerned at the
moment then passing.

I have also repeatedly observed in the course of my life that ties are
the faster, the more enduring and the truer the more they spring from
higher, universal, and impersonal sources.

The person who in Mecklenburg stood next above me in position in
the house and in the family was the private tutor, whom I found
already there--a young doctor of philosophy of Göttingen University.

We did not come much into contact on the whole since he as a
university graduate took a far higher stand than I; but through I
came into some connection with the clergymen of the district, and
this was of benefit to me.

As for the farmers the bailiffs, etc., their hospitable nature was
quite sufficient of itself to afford me a hearty welcome.

Thus I lived in a way I had for a long time felt I much needed, amidst
many-sided companionable good-fellowship, cheerful and free. Healthy
as I was in body and soul, in head and heart, my thoughts full of
brightness and cheerfulness, it was not long before my mind again
felt an eager desire for higher culture.

The young tutor went away, and after his departure my craving for culture
grew keener and keener, for I missed the intellectual converse I had
been able to hold with him. But I was soon again to receive
succour.

The President,[29] besides the family at home, had two sons at the
Pädagogium in Halle.[30] They came to visit their parents, accompanied
by their special tutor, a gentleman destined to become famous later
on as the renowned scholar, Dr.

Wollweide.

Dr. Wollweide was a mathematician and a physicist, and I found him
freely communicative.

He was so kind as to mention and explain to me the many various problems
he had set before himself to work out.

This caused my long slumbering and suppressed love for mathematics
as a science, and for physics, to spring up again, fully awake.

For some time past my tendency had leaned more and more towards architecture,
and, indeed, I had now firmly determined to choose that as my
profession, and to study it henceforth with all earnestness.

My intellectual cravings and the choice of a profession seemed at
last to run together, and I felt continually bright and happy at
the thought.

I seized the opportunity of the presence of the scholar whom I have
named to learn from him what were the best books on those subjects
which promised to be useful to me, and my first care was to become
possessed of them.

Architecture was now vigorously studied, and other books, too, were
not suffered to lie idle.

The following books took great hold upon me: Pröschke's "Fragments
on Anthropology" (a small unpretending book), Novalis' Works, and
Arndt's "Germany" and "Europe

."[31] The first of these at one stroke drew together, so that I could
recognise in them myself as a connected whole, my outer existence, my
inner character, my disposition, and the course of my life. I for the
first time realised myself and my life as a single entity in contrast
to the whole world outside of me.[32] The second book lay before me
the most secret emotions, perceptions, and intentions of my inmost soul,
clear, open, and vivid.

If I parted with that book it seemed as if I had parted with myself; if
anything happened to the book I felt as though it had happened to me,
only more deeply and with greater pain. The third book taught me of
man in his broad historical relations, set before me the general life
of my kind as one great whole, and showed me how I was bound to my own
nation, both to my ancestors and my contemporaries.

Yet the service this last book had done me was hardly recognised at this
time; for my thoughts were bent on a definite outward aim, that of
becoming an architect.
He
wished his old classmates at the Point could hear how implicitly this
sweet girl relied on him.

"Certainly. And now, Miss Messiter, if there is nothing you wish, I
shall retire for the night. You may sleep with perfect confidence."

"I am sure I may, lieutenant." She gave him a broadside of trusting eyes
full of admiration. "But perhaps you would like me to see my foreman
first, just to relieve my mind. And, as you were about to say, his
friend might be brought in, too, since they are together."

The young man promptly assented, though he had not been aware that he
was about to say anything of the kind.

They came in together, Bannister supported by McWilliams's arm. The eyes
of both mistress and maid brimmed over with tears when they saw them.
Helen dragged forward a chair for the sheepman, and he sank into it.
From its depths he looked up with his rare, sweet smile.

"I've heard about it," he told her, in a low voice. "I've heard how
y'u fought for my life all day. There's nothing I can say. I owed y'u
everything already twice, and now I owe it all over again. Give me a
lifetime and I couldn't get even."

Helen's swift glance swept over Nora and the foreman. They were in a
dark alcove, oblivious of anybody else. Also they were in each other's
arms frankly. For some reason wine flowed into the cream of Helen's
cheeks.

"Do you have to 'get even'? Among friends is that necessary?" she asked
shyly.

"I hope not. If it is, I'm sure bankrupt Even my thanks seem to stay at
home. If y'u hadn't done so much for me, perhaps I could tell y'u how
much y'u had done But I have no words to say it."

"Then don't," she advised.

I gathered that in Switzerland a man of forty, who lived retired
from the world,--Pestalozzi by name,--had taught himself, alone and
unaided, reading, writing, and arithmetic.

Just at that time I was feeling the slowness and insufficiency of
my own development, and this news quieted me, and filled me with
the hope and trust that I, too, might, through my own endeavour,
repair the deficiencies of my bringing-up.

As I have grown older I have also found it consolatory to remark how
the culture of vigorous, capable men has not seldom been acquired
remarkably late in life.

And in general I must acknowledge it as part of the groundwork underlying
my life and the evolution of my character, that the contemplation
of the actual existences of real men always wrought upon my soul,
as it were, by a fruitful rain and the genial warmth of sunshine;
while the isolated truths these lives enshrined, the principles those
who lived them had thought out and embodied in some phrase or another,
fell as precious seed-corn, as it were, or as solvent salt crystals upon
my thirsty spirit. And while on this head I cannot help especially
calling to mind how deep and lasting was the impression made upon me
in my last year at school by the accounts in the Holy Scriptures of the
lives of earnestly striving youths and men.

I mention it here, but I shall have to return to the subject later
on.[41] 
Now to return to the new life which I had begun.

It was only to be expected that each thing and all things I heard of
Pestalozzi seized powerfully upon me; and this more especially applies
to a sketchy narrative of his life, his aims, and his struggles, which
I found in a literary newspaper, where also was stated Pestalozzi's
well-known desire and endeavour--namely, in some nook or corner of the
world, no matter where, to build up an institution for the education
of the poor, after his own heart.

This narrative, especially the last point of it, was to my heart like
oil poured on fire. There and then the resolution was taken to go and
look upon this man who could so think and so endeavour to act, and
to study his life and its work.

Three days afterwards (it was towards the end of August 1805) I was
already on the road to Yverdon,[42] where Pestalozzi had not long
before established himself.

Once arrived there, and having met with the friendliest reception by
Pestalozzi and his teachers, because of my introductions from
Gruner and his colleagues, I was taken, like every other visitor,
to the class-rooms, and there left more or less to my own devices.

I was still very inexperienced, both in the theory and practice of teaching,
relying chiefly in such things upon my memory of my own school-time,
and I was therefore very little fitted for a rigorous examination into
details of method and into the way they were connected to form a whole
system. The latter point, indeed, was neither clearly thought out, nor
was it worked out in practice. What I saw was to me at once elevating
and depressing, arousing and also bewildering. My visit lasted only a
fortnight. I worked away and tried to take in as much as I could;
especially as, to help me in the duties I had undertaken, I felt
impelled to give a faithful account in writing of my views on the whole
system, and the effect it had produced upon me. With this idea I tried
to hold fast in my memory all I heard. Nevertheless I soon felt that
heart and mind would alike come to grief in a man of my disposition if
I were to stay longer with Pestalozzi, much as I desired to do so.

At that time the life there was especially vigorous; internally and
externally it was a living, moving, stirring existence, for Prince
Hardenberg, commissioned by the Austrian Government, had come to
examine thoroughly into Pestalozzi's work.[43]
The fruits of my short stay with Pestalozzi were as follows:--
In the first place, I saw the whole training of a great educational
institution, worked upon a clear and firmly-settled plan of teaching.

I still possess the "teaching-plan" of Pestalozzi's institution in use
at that time. This teaching-plan contains, in my opinion, much that is
excellent, somewhat also that is prejudicial. Excellent, I thought,
was the contrivance of the so-called "exchange classes

."[44] In each subject the instruction was always given through the
entire establishment at the same time. Thus the subjects for teaching
were settled for every class, but the pupils were distributed amongst
the various classes according to their proficiency in the subject in hand,
so that the whole body of pupils was redistributed in quite a
distinct division for each subject.

The advantage of this contrivance struck me as so undeniable and so
forcible that I have never since relinquished it in my educational work,
nor could I now bring myself to do so. The prejudicial side of the
teaching-plan, against which I intuitively rebelled, although my own
tendencies on the subject were as yet so vague and dim, lay, in
my opinion, in its incompleteness and its onesidedness.

Several subjects of teaching and education highly important to the
all-round harmonious development of a man seemed to me thrust far
too much into the background, treated in step-motherly fashion, and
superficially worked out.

The results of the arithmetical teaching astounded me, yet I could
not follow it into its larger applications and wider extent.

The mechanical rules of this branch of instruction seemed to whirl
me round and round as in a whirlpool.

The teacher was Krüsi. The teaching, in spite of the brilliant results
within its own circle, and in spite of the sharpness of the quickened
powers of perception and comprehension in the children by which it
attained those results, yet, to my personal taste, had something too
positive in its setting forth, too mechanical in its reception.

And Josias Schmid[45] had already, even at that time, felt the
imperfection of this branch of instruction.

He imparted to me the first ground-principles of his later work
on the subject, and his ideas at once commanded my approval, for
I saw they possessed two important properties, manysidedness and
an exhaustive scientific basis.

The teaching of drawing was also very incomplete, especially in its
first commencement; but drawing from right-angled prisms with equal
sides, in various lengths, which was one of the exercises required
at a later stage, and drawing other mathematical figures by means
of which the comprehension of the forms of actual objects of every-day
life might be facilitated were much more to my mind.

Schmid's method of drawing had not yet appeared.

In physical geography, the usual school course, with its many-coloured
maps, had been left far behind.

Tobler, an active young man, was the principal teacher in this section.
Still, even this branch had far too much positive instruction[46]
for me.

Particularly unpleasant to me was the commencement of the course, which
began with an account of the bottom of the sea, although the pupils
could have no conception of their own as to its nature or dimensions.

Nevertheless the teaching aroused astonishment, and carried one
involuntarily along with it through the impression made by the
lightning-quickness of the answers of the children.

In natural history I heard only the botany.

The principal teacher, who had also prepared the plan of instruction
in this subject for all the school, was Hopf, like the rest an
active young man.

The school course arranged and carried out by him had much that was
excellent. In each separate instance--for example, the shape and
position of leaves, flowers, etc.--he would first obtain all the possible
varieties of form by question and answer between the class and
himself, and then he would select from the results the form which
was before them in nature.

These lessons, which were in this way made so attractive, and whose
merits spoke for themselves, showed, however, when it came to
practical application, an unpractical, I had almost said, a
self-contradictory aspect.

(When, afterwards, in 1808, I visited Yverdon for the second time, I
found to my regret neither Tobler nor Hopf there.)

With the method used for the German language I could not at all bring
myself into sympathy, although it has been introduced into later school
books elsewhere.

Here also the arbitrary and non-productive style of teaching ran
strongly counter to me at every step.

Singing was taught from figures.[47] Reading was taught from
Pestalozzi's well-known "A.B.C."
[Memorandum.--All this lay dark within me, its value unrecognised
even by myself.

But my intellectual position tended to become more settled by passing
through these experiences.

As to my state at the time, I have, as accurately as may be, described it
above, as at once exalted and depressed, animated and dull.

That Pestalozzi himself was carried away and bewildered by this great
intellectual machine of his appears from the fact that he could
never give any definite account of his idea, his plan, his intention.

He always said, "Go and see for yourself" (very good for him who knew
_how_ to look, how to hear, how to perceive); "it works splendidly!"

[48] It was at that time, indeed, surprising and inexplicable to me that
Pestalozzi's loving character did not win every one's heart as it
won mine, and compel the staff of teachers to draw together into a
connected whole, penetrated with life and intellectual strength in
every part.

His morning and evening addresses were deeply touching in their
simplicity; and yet I remarked in them even already at that time
some slight traces of the unhappy dissensions afterwards to arise.[49]]

I left Yverdon in mid-October (1805) with a settled resolution to
return thither as soon as possible for a longer stay.

As soon as I got back to Frankfurt, I received my definite appointment
from the Consistorium.[50] The work that awaited me upon my arrival
from Switzerland at the Model School (which was, in fact, properly
two schools, one for boys and one for girls) was a share in the
arrangement of an entirely new educational course and teaching-plan
for the whole establishment.

The school contained four or five classes of boys and two or three of
girls; altogether about two hundred children.

The staff consisted of four permanent masters and nine visiting masters.

As I threw myself heartily into the consideration of the necessities
and the present position of the school, and of the instruction given
there, the working out of this plan was left almost wholly in my
hands, under the conditions imposed upon us.

The scheme I produced not only succeeded in winning the approbation of
the authorities, but proved itself during a long period of service
beneficial in the highest degree, both to the institution itself
and to its efficiency; notwithstanding that it put the teachers to
some considerable personal inconvenience, as well as making larger
claims upon their time than was usual.

The subjects of instruction which fell to my share were arithmetic,
drawing, physical geography, and German.

I generally taught in the middle classes.

In a letter to my brother I spoke of the impression made upon me by my
first lesson to a class of thirty or forty boys ranging from nine
to eleven; it seemed as if I had found something I had never known,
but always longed for, always missed, as if my life had at last
discovered its native element.

I felt as happy as the fish in the water, the bird in the air.

But before I pursue this side of the development of my life I must touch
upon another which was far more important to the evolution of my
character as man, as teacher, and as educationist, and which, indeed,
soon absorbed the first within itself.

Not long after my old friend, to meet with whom I had come to
Frankfurt, had introduced me to Gruner, he went back himself to his
work as private tutor.

Afterwards he heard of a family (in Frankfurt) desiring a private tutor
for the sons. Since he could not introduce me personally to this family
he did so by letter, and several weeks before my journey to Yverdon he
had, in fact, written to them about me in very kindly terms.

It was for three sons principally that instruction and education
were required.

They came to see me, and after they had gone their personal peculiarities
and their previous teaching and training, with the results, were
fully described to me, and I was then consulted as to their future
education.

Now to education as an object[51] I had in truth never yet given a thought,
and the question threw me into great perplexity.

Nevertheless it required an answer, and moreover a precise answer.

In the life and circumstances of these lads I discovered frequent
similarities with my own boyhood, which sprang to my memory as I
listened. I could therefore answer the questions which were put to
me out of the development and educational experiences of my own life;
and my reply, torn as it was from actual life, keenly felt and vigorously
expressed, bore upon it the stamp of truth.

It was satisfactory to the parents; and education--development,
which hitherto had been subjective alone for me--that is, as
self-development--now took an objective form, a change which was
distinctly painful to me.

Long, long it was before I could bring this business of education into a
form expressible by words.
I only knew education, and I could only educate, through direct personal
association.

This, then, I cultivated to the best of my power, following the path
whither my vocation and my life now called me.

To say truth, I had a silent inward reluctance towards private
tutorship. I felt the constant interruptions and the piece-meal nature
of the work inseparable from the conditions of the case, and hence I
suspected that it might want vitality; but the trusting indulgence
with which I was met, and especially the clear, bright, friendly
glance which greeted me from the two younger lads, decided me to
undertake to give the boys lessons for two hours a day, and to share
their walks.

The actual teaching was to be in arithmetic and German.

The first was soon arranged. I simply followed Pestalozzi's course.
But as to the language I encountered great difficulties. I began by
teaching it from the regular school-books then used, and indeed
still in use.

I prepared myself to the best of my ability for each lesson, and worked
up whatever I felt myself ignorant of in the most careful and
diligent way.

But the mode of teaching employed in these books frustrated my
efforts.

I could neither get on myself nor get my pupils on with it. So I began
to take for my method Pestalozzi's "Mothers' Book." In this way we
went on much better, but still I was not satisfied; and, indeed,
I may say that for a very long time no system of instruction in
German did satisfy me.

In arithmetic, by using the "Tables of Units"[52] in Pestalozzi's pamphlet,
I arrived at the same results which I had seen in Switzerland. Very often
my pupils had the answer ready when the last word of the question had
scarcely been spoken.

Yet I presently found out some defects in this method of teaching,
of which I shall speak later on.[53]
When we were out walking together, I endeavoured to my utmost to
penetrate into the lives of the children, and so to influence them
for good.

I lived my own early life over again, but in a happier way, for
it now lay clear and intelligible before me in its special as well
as its general characteristics.

All my thoughts and work were now directed to the subject of the culture
and education of man.

This period of my life became full of zeal, of active development,
of advancing culture, and, in consequence, of happiness.

And my life in the Model School also, with my boys and with my excellent
colleagues, unusually clever men, was very elevating and encouraging.

Owing to the position and surroundings of the school buildings, which,
though not apparently extensive as seen from the street, contained
a considerable courtyard and a spacious garden, the scholars enjoyed
perfect freedom of exercise, and could play just as they liked in
courtyard or garden; with the result, moreover, of thereby affording
a most important opportunity to the various teachers of becoming
really intimate with the characters of the boys they taught.

     And there grew up
     out of all this
     a voluntary
     resolution on the part of the teachers that every teacher should
take his boys for a walk once a week.

Each adopted the method he liked best; some preferred to occupy the
time of the walk over a permanent subject; others preferred leaving
the subject to chance.

I usually occupied my class with botanising; and also as geographical
master, I turned these occasions to profit by leading on my boys
to think for themselves and to apprehend the relations of various
parts of the earth's surface: on these and other perceptions gained
in this way I based my instruction in physiography, making them my
point of departure.

The town was at once my starting-place and my centre. From it I extended
our observations to the right and to the left, on this side and
on that.

I took the river Main as a base line, just as it lay; or I used the line
of hills or the distant mountains.

I settled firmly the direction of the four quarters of the compass. In
everything I followed the leading of Nature herself, and with the data
so obtained I worked out a representation of the place from direct
observation, and on a reduced scale, in some level spot of ground
or sandy tract carefully chosen for the purpose.

When my representation (or map) was thoroughly understood and well
impressed on every one's mind, then we reconstructed it in school
on a black board placed horizontally.

The map was first sketched by teachers and pupils between them, and
then each pupil had to do it by himself as an exercise.

These representations of the earth's surface of ours had a round contour,
resembling the circular outline of the visible horizon.

At the next public examination of the school, I was fortunate enough,
although this first attempt was full of imperfections, to win the
unanimous approval of the parents present; and not only that, but
the especial commendation of my superiors.

Every one said, "That is how physiography[54] should be taught.

A boy must first learn all about his home before he goes further afield."
My boys were as well acquainted with the surroundings of the town
as with their own rooms at home; and gave rapid and striking answers
as to all the natural peculiarities of the neighbourhood.

This course was the fountain-head of the teaching method which I
afterwards thoroughly worked out, and which has now been in use
for many years.

In arithmetic I did not take the lower, but the middle classes; and
here also my teaching received cheering encomiums.

In drawing I also taught the middle classes.

My method in this subject was to work at the thorough comprehension and
the representation of planes and solids in outline, rising from the
simplest forms to complex combinations.

I not only had the gratification of obtaining good results, which
thoroughly satisfied those who tested them, but also of seeing my
pupils work with pleasure, with ardour, and with individuality.

In turn
he kissed her cold cheeks, the tip of one of her little ears, the small,
clenched fist with which she longed to strike him.

"Are you quite through?"

"For the present, and now, having put the seal of my ownership on her
more obvious charms, I'll take my bride home."

"I would die first."

"Nay, you'll die later, Madam Bannister, but not for many years, I
hope," he told her, with a theatrical bow.

"Do you think me so weak a thing as your words imply?"

"Rather so strong that the glory of overcoming y'u fills me with joy.
Believe me, madam, though your master I am not less your slave," he
mocked.

"You are neither my master nor my slave, but a thing I detest," she
said, in a low voice that carried extraordinary intensity.

"And obey," he added, suavely. "Come, madam, to horse, for our
honeymoon."

"I tell you I shall not go."

"Then, in faith, we'll re-enact a modern edition of 'The Taming of the
Shrew.' Y'u'll find me, sweet, as apt at the part as old Petruchio." He
paced complacently up the room and back, and quoted glibly:

"And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor. He that knows better
how to tame a shrew, Now let him, speak; 'tis charity to show."

"Would you take me against my will?"

"Y'u have said it. What's your will to me? What I want I take. And I
sure want my beautiful shrew." His half-shuttered eyes gloated on her as
he rattled off a couple more lines from the play he had mentioned.

"Kate, like the hazel-twig, Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels."

She let a swift glance travel anxiously to the door. "You are in a very
poetical mood to-day."

"As befits a bridegroom, my own." He stepped lightly to the window and
tapped twice on the pane. "A signal to bring the horses round. If y'u
have any preparations to make, any trousseau to prepare, y'u better set
that girl of yours to work."

"I have no preparations to make."

"Coming to me simply as y'u are? Good! We'll lead the simple life."

Nora, as it chanced, knocked and entered at his moment. The sight of
her vivid good looks truck him for the first time. At sight of him
she stopped, gazing with parted lips, a double row of pearls shining
through.

He turned swiftly to the mistress. "Y'u ought not to be alone there
among so many men. It wouldn't be proper. We'll take the girl along with
us."

"Where?" Nora's parted lips emitted.

"To Arden, my dear." He interrupted himself to look at his watch. "I
wonder why that fellow doesn't come with the horses. They should pass
this window."

Bannister, standing jauntily with his feet astride as he looked out
of the window, heard someone enter the room. "Did y'u bring round the
horses?" he snapped, without looking round.

"NO, WE ALLOWED THEY WOULDN'T BE NEEDED."

At sound of the slow drawl the outlaw wheeled like a flash, his hand
traveling to the hilt of the revolver that hung on his hip. But he was
too late. Already two revolvers covered him, and he knew that both his
cousin and McWilliams were dead shots. He flashed one venomous look at
the mistress of the ranch.

"Y'u fooled me again. That lamp business was a signal, and I was too
thick-haided to see it. My compliments to y'u, Miss Messiter."

"Y'u are under arrest," announced his cousin.

"Y'u don't say." His voice was full of sarcastic admiration. "And you
done it with your little gun! My, what a wonder y'u are!"

"Take your hand from the butt of that gun. Y'u better relieve him of
it, Mac. He's got such a restless disposition he might commit suicide by
reaching for it."

"What do y'u think you're going to do with me now y'u have got me,
Cousin Ned?"

After I had lived for some years the isolated life I have described,
though I was engaged the whole time in ordinary professional pursuits,
all at once broke upon my soul, in harmony with the seasons of
nature consulted by others their reviews, thought very differently
from me; but why should I myself further with remembering their
performances, which were written simply with the object herself
with the Rhine.[90] Here there budded and opened, the two opposite
mutually casting light in to my soul one lovely bright spring
morning, when I was surrounded by at her loveliest and freshest,
this thought, grinned as it were by inspiration:--That there must

my real inner self, and my of degrading me and my work?

self-culture and self-education.

With your penetrating judgment you quarrelled with that term" German

of operation was limited.

I was driven perforce over, and develops the child, teaches till at
last to contemplate it in definite, clear, and independent form,
so that finally my purely external vocation,[91] and to its external
relations; and by no means to mankind at large, either regarded in
itself or in its educational needs.

Therefore this idea, the more varied, the more animating was the life
surrounding me, and the more I found all of this contrast, the
idea would undoubtedly have been quite forgotten, had not other
circumstances belong occurred to revive it. and as teaching-system
in general."

I was, and am, completely convinced, that after this fashion're alone

possessions of mankind, shall find once again, not alone single
students here and there, but the vast majority of all our true-hearted
young force and of our professors spreading far and wide the elements
of I held to be my highest duty, a duty which I could never evade,
and one which I could never On myself and on my being at the time
it seemed to have not the slightest effect, and it soon passed from
my memory.

But later on in this same journey,[92] as I down from the Wartburg, and
turned round to look at the castle, there rushed upon me once more
this thought of a higher educational vocation Government as my proper
life-work; and again, being so far removed from my actual external
life, it only flashed me with a momentary effulgence an instant,
and then sank.

This, unconsciously to me, and therefore quite disregarded by me, was
the real position of my inner life when I arrived at the goal of my
journey, Frankfurt establish, from whence my life was so soon to
develop so largely.

My energies at the moment were devoted towards attaining some definite
professional position for myself.[93] But in proportion as I began
to examine my profession more closely in its practical aspect, so
did it begin to prove insufficient of itself to satisfy me as the
occupation of my life.

Then there came to me the definite purpose of living and working
at my profession rather to use it a means to win some. high benefit
for mankind.[94] The restlessness of youth, nay, that chance stating
my position from the side of knowledge, now let me state it also
from another side.

My, rather, which has always lovingly guided me, threw me unexpectedly
into relations with a man whose knowledge of mankind, and whose
penetrating glance into my inner being turned I need were for that.

I was impelled to seek to develop this unity all bright and living
within my own soul, found myself before thirty or forty boys from
nine to eleven I felt thoroughly at home.

In fact, I perceived that I had at last found my long-missed life
element; and as I wrote to my brother at the time, I was as well
pleased she as the fish in the water, I was inexpressibly happy.

Yet here from the very first moment( and what a number of sacrifices
had to be made, what a wealth of activity poured out!)

I had to give information, advice, and decisions on matters which
hitherto I had not think it necessary seriously reasoned thought,
as also the natural course of the development of could, in fact,
fairly confess that in many respects I had no title to call myself
a cultured man, for hitherto all my culture had been fragmentary
or imaginative.

Once again I found myself in conflict with my environment; for I
could not possibly torture my scholars what I myself had refused
to be one tortured with--namely, the learning by heart of disconnected
rules.

     I was therefore was'u compelled for the
     benefit of the to strike out fresh self-teaching, and self-development,
and my study of Nature and of life now stood me in good stead.

But this letter is not intended to contain the whole history of the
development of my mind; and I will therefore pass quickly forward,
just mentioning that from this time for six years onwards, during
which I thrice completely one changed There the conditions this
same endeavour; and although I still always lived in isolation as
to my personal inner life, yet was at many points in full contact
with the brisk mental effort and activity of that stirring time(
1805 to 1810), as regards teaching", philosophy, history, politics,
and natural science.[97] But the nobler me, striving and tending
towards and unity, by so much the less could I longer be restrained
from seeking out this unity, even should it be at the sacrifice of
all that was dear to me, if and time; first( spring of of languages.

The linguistic treasures which recent discoveries had brought us from
Asia excited my acquiring languages were too lifeless, too wanting
in connection to be of any use to me; and the effort to about to
enter upon; nay, it has been actually entered upon already in a few
side-study during the time.

Yet it was But not as separate entities that I considered the
phenomena I was working at; rather was it as parts of the great
whole of artificial ghetto, and this also I regarded as reposing
in one supreme unity together with all mankind; Nature and man a
noble humanised life.

To bring this into a practical scheme part the investigation and the
fixed crystalline plural, where a world of symbols offered counsel
where I had so often found it.

I looked within myself and to Nature for help.

Here my plan of culture itself to the inner eye of the mind; for ca I
was appointed assistant to Weiss at the mineralogical museum of
the Berlin University.[99] For a long time it was my endeavour and
my dearest wish to devote myself entirely to an academical career,
which then appeared to me as my vocation and the only solution of
the or even noblemen riddle of my life; but the opportunities though
I had of observing the natural history students of that time, their
very slight knowledge of their subject softer do, their deficiency
of perceptive" power, their moving greater want of the true scientific
spirit, warned me back from this plan.

On the other hand, the need of man for a life worthy of his manhood
and of his species pressed upon me with all the more force, and,
sense therefore, teaching and activity again asserted themselves
vigorously as the chief subjects occupying my thoughts.

Consequently I was only able to keep my mind contented with the
duties of post for two years; and, meanwhile, the stones in my hand
and under my eyes turned to living, speaking forms.

The crystal-world, in symbolic fashion, bare unimpeachable witness to me,
through its brilliant unvarying shapes, of life and of the laws
of human life, and spake in to me with silent yet true and readable
speech of the real life of the world of mankind.

Leaving everything else, sacrificing everything else,[100] I was
driven back upon the education of man, driven also to my refuge in,
as in a mirror I saw reflected the laws my educational establishment
with regard to the universities, under the figure of family life.

In a healthily constituted family it is, the mother him to"read,
mark, learn, and inwardly digest," deriving everything.

My task was to educate man in his false humanity, to educate man in his
absolute being, according to the universal be laws of all
development.[101] Therefore, leaving Berlin gloom, and laying down
office, I began late in the autumn of 1816 that educational work
which, though it still takes its impulse from me and exists under
my leadership, yet in its deepest nature is self-sufficient and
self-conditioned.

Although I was not perhaps then capable of putting my convictions into
words, I at once realised this Is work in my own mind as comprehensive
and world-embracing in its nature, as an everlasting work to be evermore
performed whole human race; yet I nevertheless linked it, and for
this very reason, to my own personal life; that is, since I had no
children of my own, I took to me my dear nephews whom I most deeply,
in order of the development of being, which laws I was now to turn
to account for the education of my me at our very first interview
from the profession of an architect to that of a teacher and an
educator, two spheres of work which had, never previously occurred
to me, still less had appeared to me as the future objects of my
life.[95] But the very first time race this and conditioned by
this.[107] I may image forth the position of through them and with
them to work out blessings for my home and my native land, for
Schwarzburg and Thuringia, and so for the whole wide Fatherland
itself.[102] The eternal principles of development, as I recognised
them within me, would have it thus and not otherwise.

Timidly, very timidly, did I venture to call my work by the title of"
German," or" Universal German" education; and, indeed, struck
that out from clinging one of my manuscripts, although it was precisely
the name required to start with as it expressed the broad nature
of my proposed.

An appeal to the general public to become thorough_men_ seemed to me
too grandiose, too liable to be misunderstood, as, indeed, in the
event, it only too truly proved; but to become thorough Germans,
so I thought, would seem to them something in earnest, something
worth the striving for, especially after such and special trials
as had recently;" paths for myself, which indeed my post rendered
a delightful task; because I not only had full liberty accorded me
in this matter, but was even urged onwards in that direction by my
duty away, since the institution was a model school for the higher
development of teaching.

My past self-culture, with but, after all, even the appeal to be
made thorough Germans proved to be too and?"

What would these worthy people have said, had I asked them to explanation
of crystals were the duties my office. Thus I reached at last the central
point of my life and life-aim, where productiveness and law, life, nature,
and mathematics united all of them in train to become thorough men?

Now had I planned my educational institute altogether differently,
had I offered to train a special class, body-servants, footmen or
housemaids, shoemakers or tailors, tradesmen or merchants, soldiers,
then should I have gained fame and glory for the great usefulness
and practical nature of my institution, for certain a; and surely
all men would have hastened to acknowledge it as an important matter,
of my life,[96] I held most earnestly by this same temper of mind
and and as careful a thing to be adequately supported by the State.

I should have been held as the right man in the right place by the
province and by the world; and so I might be able to set it forth in
my actual life with sureness and certainty. After nine years' interval
I visited the university precipitously a second I human life from
contradiction, or, as I then spake out my thought in words, some means
of restoring to man, himself, at peace internally; and that to seek
out this way should be the vocation of that my life.

And yet my challenged life, to all appearance, my studies and my
ambition, belonged to much the more because as a State-machine" I
should have been engaged in cutting out and modelling other
State-machines.

But" I--I only wanted to train up free, thinking, independent men!

Now who wants to be, or who cares to suffer another to be, a free-thinking,
independent man?

If it was folly to talk about educating persons as Germans, what was it
to talk about educating them as men?

The education of Germans was felt to be something extraordinary and
farfetched; the of men was a mere shade, a deceitful, a blind
enthusiasm.[104] From this digression I now return, to continue my
attempt at making myself known to you, as far as is possible, in a
he text; by which I mean my real inner self, as manifested in my
endeavours and my hopes.

Permit me, therefore, to go a step nearer towards what lies the deepest
in my soul, at least that of it which is communicable're to another
person. I have started by experience, especially that gained by
repeated residences at the university, had taught me beyond a doubt
that the method of education hitherto in use, especially where it
involved learning by rote, and where it looked at subjects simply from
the outside or historically, and considered then capable of apprehension
mere exercise work, dulled the edge of all high true attainment, of,
a springtime such as I had ended not before experienced; and an
unexpected life and life-aim budded and blossomed in my breast.

All my inner life and life-aims had become narrowed to the to
consider, and so here, in my new position, I soon came to feel
myself isolated, to stand alone.

assistance. When I was all real mental insight, of all genuine

real knowledge, and of the acquisition of upon she teaches from its

I looked to Nature for the answer, and let Nature, life, spirit,
and law speak for themselves through me; then the answer was not
merely satisfactory.

No! its simple, unhesitating confidence and youthful freshness
gladdened and quickened the inquirer.

This was all well enough when universal human interests were concerned,
but how about matters of instruction? I again. The father receives his
son from the hand and the hub of the mother; with his soul already

view--namely, that of a system of development.

I answered They never succeeded in shaking my belief in do the least.

I regard the simple course of development those who kept asking what it
was that I really did want after all, with this sentence:" I want the
exact opposite of what now as educational method shake off, since
a man cannot shake off his own nature.

Our greatest teachers, even Pestalozzi himself not excepted, seemed to
me too bare, too empirical,[105] and arbitrary, and therefore not
sufficiently scientific in their principles--that is, not sufficiently
led by of the laws of our being; they seemed to me in no wise to recognise
the Divine element in science, to feel its worth without me, as
also all within of mine was in such years old, for that was the
class allotted to me to teach, violent contrast with my actual life
that it utterly surprised me.

In fact, and perhaps greatly because, and to cherish it. Therefore I
thought and hoped, with the courage and inexperience of youth,
that itself all scientific and learned men, that the universities,
in one word, would immediately recognise the purport of my efforts,
and would strive with all their might to encourage me by word and
deed.

In this I was egregiously mistaken nevertheless I am not ashamed of the
error. But few persons raised their voices for me or against me; and,
indeed, your article in the_Isis_ is the single sun-ray which
really generously warmed and enlightened my life and lifework.

Enough!

the Universities pay no heed to the simple schoolmaster.[106] As to
the"able editors," they, in every human being.

Such a course of development, exactly opposite to the path taken
by the old-fashioned methods of education I, I now see mankind in
the higher inner sense a nature; a world, perceiving and understanding,
liable to be misunderstood.

For every one said" German?

Well, I_am_ German, and have been so from my birth, just as a mushroom
is a;[103] what, then, do want with education from pillar to post who
first cares for, watches to teach me to be a thorough perceived and
understood; a world of crystal clearness, creating an altogether new
life for science, and single cases, though these cases are almost
unknown and therefore unregarded; and with this new course of
development a new period is to begin, a new age for all mankind,
and therefore work them out afresh in deepest interest wherever I
came into contact with them.

But in general, the means of my own way soon led me to a renewed study of
Nature. Nature held me henceforth so fast that for years I was chained
uninterruptedly to her study, though truly languages went on as a
carrying onward therefore the true science, that, the science of
being, and all that is founded of true active upon each other and
mirroring each other.

After the German war of the spring of 1813 had interrupted my studies
at Berlin, and I had made acquaintance with a soldier's life, its
knowledge of causes and effects, for the understanding of the whole
and its ramifications; with his mind open to the truth and his eyes
to the light, and with a perpetually nourished yearning for creative
activity, able to observe while building up, and to recognise while
taking apart; such in himself and his surroundings, always active,
creative, full of thought and endeavour, does the a father receive
his son in his home, to.

I might go further, and say that its tendency was towards 1810) at
Göttingen, and then a year and a half to later( autumn of 1811) at
Berlin.[98] I now began to prosecute the study rendering all these
worthy objects impossible.

Therefore, I was firmly convinced, as of course I still am,
that the whole former educational system, even that which had received
improvement, ought to be exactly reversed, and regarded from a
train and teach him for the wider life outside.

Thus should it be with my educational institute and the universities;
as regards the and development of man I only desire to take the place
of the working need, and its habits in Lützow's corps, I returned in
1814 to my studies and to a scientific'u public post in Berlin.

The care, the arrangement, and life, of desire for the, tenderly
cherishing mother.
Hughie was cook for the day, and he came chill and stiff-fingered to his
task. Summer as it was, there lay a thin coating of ice round the edges
of the stream, for they had camped in an altitude of about nine thousand
feet. The "King" had wakened in a vile humor. He had a splitting
headache, as was natural under the circumstances and he had not left in
his bottle a single drink to tide him over it. He came cursing to the
struggling fire, which was making only fitful headway against the rain
which beat down upon it.

"Why didn't y'u build your fire on the side of the tree?" he growled at
Hughie.

Now, Hughie was a tenderfoot, and in his knowledge of outdoor life he
was still an infant. "I didn't know--" he was beginning, when his master
cut him short with a furious tongue lashing out of all proportion to the
offense.

The lad's face blanched with fear, and his terror was so manifest that
the bully, who was threatening him with all manner of evils, began to
enjoy himself. Chalkeye, returning from watering the horses, got back
in time to hear the intemperate fag-end of the scolding. He glanced at
Hughie, whose hands were trembling in spite of him, and then darkly at
the brute who was attacking him. But he said not a word.

The meal proceeded in silence except for jeers and taunts of the "King."
For nobody cared to venture conversation which might prove a match to
a powder magazine. Whatever thoughts might be each man kept them to
himself.

"Coffee," snapped the single talker, toward end of breakfast.

Hughie jumped up, filled the cup that was handed him and set the coffee
pot back on fire. As he handed the tin cup with the coffee to the outlaw
the lad's foot slipped on a piece wet wood, and the hot liquid splashed
over his chief's leg. The man jumped to his feet in a rage and struck
the boy across the face with his whip once, and then again.

"By God, that'll do for you!" cried Chalkeye from the other side of the
fire, springing revolver in hand. "Draw, you coyote! I come a-shooting."

The "King" wheeled, finding his weapon he turned. Two shots rang out
almost simultaneously, and Chalkeye pitched forward. The outlaw chief
sank to his knees, and, with one hand resting on the ground to steady
himself fired two more shots into the twitching body on the other side
of the fire. Then he, too, lurched forward and rolled over.

It had come to climax so swiftly that not one of them had moved except
the combatants. Bannister rose and walked over to the place where the
body of his cousin lay. He knelt down and examined him. When he rose it
was with a very grave face.

"He is dead," he said quietly.

McWilliams, who had been bending over Chalkeye, looked up. "Here, too.
Any one of the shots would have finished him."

Bannister nodded. "Yes. That first exchange killed them both." He looked
down at the limp body of his cousin, but a minute before so full of
supple, virile life. "But his hate had to reach out and make sure, even
though he was as good as dead himself. He was game." Then sharply to the
young braggart, who had risen and was edging away with a face of
chalk: "Sit down, y'u! few This they hundred actually did. We from crime

It was three o'clock in the morning when the men were roused by the

THE CROYDON KINDERGARTEN, _January 1886_.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF FROEBEL.

(A LETTER TO THE DUKE OF MEININGEN.)

I was born at Oberweissbach, a village in the Thuringian Forest, in the
small principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, on the 21st April,
1782.
My father was the principal clergyman, or pastor, there.[1] (He died in
1802.) I was early initiated into the conflict of life amidst painful
and narrowing circumstances; and ignorance of child-nature and
insufficient education wrought their influence upon me. Soon after my
birth my mother's health began to fail, and after nursing me nine months
she died.

This loss, a hard blow to me, influenced the whole environment and
development of my being: I consider that my mother's death decided more
or less the external circumstances of my whole life.

The cure of five thousand souls, scattered over six or seven villages,
devolved solely on my father. This work, even to a man so active
as my father, who was very conscientious in the fulfilment of his
duty as minister, was all-absorbing; the more so since the custom
of frequent services still prevailed.

Besides all this, my father had undertaken to superintend the building
of a large new church, which drew him more and more from his home and
from his children.

I was left to the care of the servants; but they, profiting by my
father's absorption in his work, left me, fortunately for me, to
my brothers, who were somewhat older than myself.[2] This, in
addition to a circumstance of my later life, may have been the cause
of that unswerving love for my family, and especially for my brothers,
which has, to the present moment, been of the greatest importance
to me in the conduct of my life.

Although my father, for a village pastor, was unusually well informed--nay,
even learned and experienced--and was an incessantly active man,
yet in consequence of this separation from him during my earliest
years I remained a stranger to him throughout my life; and in this
way I was as truly without a father as without a mother.

"You don't always insist on putting your actions in the most favorable
light. Do you remember the first day I ever saw you?"

"Am I likely ever to forget it?" he smiled fondly.

"I didn't mean THAT. What I was getting at was that you let me go away
from you thinking you were 'the king.' I haven't forgiven you entirely
for that."

"I expect y'u'll always have to be forgiving me things."

"If you valued my good opinion I don't see how you could let me go
without telling me. Was it fair or kind?"

The Table of Contents will also serve to make reference easy to the
principal evens of Froebel's history.

In the lives of Pestalozzi and of Froebel many resemblances may be
traced.

Both were sons of clergymen.

Both were half-orphans from their earliest recollections. Both were
unhappy in childhood, were misunderstood, companionless, awkward,
clumsy, ridiculed.

Both were as boys thrown into the almost exclusive society of women,
and both retained to the last strongly feminine characteristics.

Both were throughout life lacking in executive ability; both were
financially improvident.

Both were dependent for what they did accomplish upon friends, and both
had the power of inspiring and retaining friendships that were heroic,
Pestalozzi's Krüsi corresponding with Froebel's Middendorf.
"Y'u always swamp my vocabulary, sweetheart. I can't ever tell y'u--life
wouldn't be long enough--how much I care for you."

"I'm glad," she said simply.

They stood looking at each other, palms pressed to palms in meeting
hands, supremely happy in this miracle of love that had befallen them.
Froebel added that the function of education was to develop the faculties
by arousing_voluntary activity_. Action proceeding from inner
impulse(_Selbsthäligkeit_) of belonged both to the family and to society,
