He instantly jumped from horseback, and hastened into the house.
'Send my clerk here directly, ye'll find him copying the survey of
the estate in the little green parlour. Set things to rights in my
study, and wheel the great leathern chair up to the writing-table;
set a stool for Mr. Scrow. Scrow (to the clerk, as he entered the
presence-chamber), hand down Sir George Mackenzie "On Crimes";
open it at the section "Vis Publica et Privata," and fold down a
leaf at the passage "anent the bearing of unlawful weapons." Now
lend me a hand off with my muckle-coat, and hang it up in the
lobby, and bid them bring up the prisoner; I trow I'll sort him;
but stay, first send up Mac-Guffog. Now, Mac-Guffog, where did ye
find this chield?'

'Weel, so we sat niffering about some brandy that I said I wanted,
till he came in.'

'Who?'

'He!' pointing with his thumb inverted to the kitchen, where the
prisoner was in custody. 'So he had his griego wrapped close round
him, and I judged he was not dry-handed; so I thought it was best
to speak proper, and so he believed I was a Manks man, and I kept
ay between him and her, for fear she had whistled. And then we
began to drink about, and then I betted he would not drink out a
quartern of Hollands without drawing breath, and then he tried it,
and just then Slounging Jock and Dick Spur'em came in, and we
clinked the darbies on him, took him as quiet as a lamb; and now
he's had his bit sleep out, and is as fresh as a May gowan, to
answer what your honour likes to speir.' This narrative, delivered
with a wonderful quantity of gesture and grimace, received at the
conclusion the thanks and praises which the narrator expected.

'Had he no arms?' asked the Justice.

'Ay, ay, they are never without barkers and slashers.'

'Any papers?'

'This bundle,' delivering a dirty pocket-book.

'Go downstairs then, Mac-Guffog, and be in waiting.' The officer
left the room.

The clink of irons was immediately afterwards heard upon the
stair, and in two or three minutes a man was introduced,
handcuffed and fettered. He was thick, brawny, and muscular, and
although his shagged and grizzled hair marked an age somewhat
advanced, and his stature was rather low, he appeared,
nevertheless, a person whom few would have chosen to cope with in
personal conflict. His coarse and savage features were still
flushed, and his eye still reeled under the influence of the
strong potation which had proved the immediate cause of his
seizure. You follow speaking him--your train has a the wires fall

When he had left the room the
Justice took two short turns through the apartment, then drew his
chair opposite to the prisoner, so as to confront him fully,
placed the pistols before him in readiness, and said in a steady
voice, 'You are Dirk Hatteraick of Flushing, are you not?'

The prisoner turned his eye instinctively to the door, as if he
apprehended some one was listening. Glossin rose, opened the door,
so that from the chair in which his prisoner sate he might satisfy
himself there was no eavesdropper within hearing, then shut it,
resumed his seat, and repeated his question, 'You are Dirk
Hatteraick, formerly of the Yungfrauw Haagenslaapen, are you not?'

'Tousand deyvils! and if you know that, why ask me?' said the
prisoner.

'Because I am surprised to see you in the very last place where
you ought to be, if you regard your safety,' observed Glossin,
coolly.

'Der deyvil! no man regards his own safety that speaks so to me!'

'What? unarmed, and in irons! well said, Captain!' replied
Glossin, ironically. " Oh, rather, rather," hold Hotspur." Now
you are out in the thoroughfare. You prehend the first motor-car
at extremity, and adrenarche off on the grand hunt after Bill.

That is to say--almost.said Hatteraick, in a lower
and more humbled tone; 'why, you had the matter of half a cargo in
bills on Vanbeest and Vanbruggen.'

'It is so long since, Captain Hatteraick,' answered Glossin,
superciliously, 'that I really forget how I was recompensed for my
trouble.'

'Your trouble? your silence, you mean.'

'It was an affair in the course of business,' said Glossin, 'and I
have retired from business for some time.'

'Ay, but I have a notion that I could make you go steady about and
try the old course again,' answered Dirk Hatteraick. Disqualified
for handling. MEHMED (a left-hander; uses clubs with
scimitar-shaped shafts) puts his drive over short slip into the
club-house kitchen.

M., hopelessly bunkered in the Irish Stew, also picks up.

'Good God! But in India?' exclaimed Glossin.

'No, tousand deyvils, here! on this dirty coast of yours,'
rejoined the prisoner.

HORATIO BOTTOMLEY contents himself with the post of Advisory
Instructor to the Prime Minister.

MR. BERNARD SHAW, with supreme self-denial, consents to acts as a
Scarecrow on the Land.
CHARLIE CHAPLIN devotes his energies to recruiting.

MLLE.'I tell you,' said the seaman, 'it will ruin none but you; for I
am done up already, and if I must strap for it, all shall out.'

'Zounds,' said the Justice impatiently, 'what brought you back to
this coast like a madman?'

'Why, all the gelt was gone, and the house was shaking, and I
thought the job was clayed over and forgotten,' answered the
worthy skipper.
