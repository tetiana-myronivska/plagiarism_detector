Ontario Moggs, as he went homewards by himself, was disturbed by
various thoughts. If it really was to be the case that Polly Neefit
wouldn't have him, why should he stay in a country so ill-adapted to
his manner of thinking as this? Why remain in a paltry island while
all the starry west, with its brilliant promises, was open to him?
Here he could only quarrel with his father, and become a rebel, and
perhaps live to find himself in a jail. And then what could he do of
good? He preached and preached, but nothing came of it. Would not
the land of the starry west suit better such a heart and such a mind
as his? But he wouldn't stir while his fate was as yet unfixed in
reference to Polly Neefit. Strikes were dear to him, and oratory, and
the noisy applauses of the Cheshire Cheese; but nothing was so dear
to him as Polly Neefit. He went about the world with a great burden
lying on his chest, and that burden was his love for Polly Neefit.
In regard to strikes and the ballot he did in a certain way reason
within himself and teach himself to believe that he had thought out
those matters; but as to Polly he thought not at all. He simply loved
her, and felt himself to be a wild, frantic man, quarrelling with his
father, hurrying towards jails and penal settlements, rushing about
the streets half disposed to suicide, because Polly Neefit would have
none of him. He had been jealous, too, of the gasfitter, when he had
seen his Polly whirling round the room in the gasfitter's arms;--but
the gasfitter was no gentleman, and the battle had been even. In
spite of the whirling he still had a chance against the gasfitter.
Lantier didn't like the wine from Francois's, so he persuaded Gervaise
to buy her wine from Vigouroux, the coal-dealer. Then he decided that
Coudeloup's bread was not baked to his satisfaction, so he sent
Augustine to the Viennese bakery on the Faubourg Poissonniers for
their bread. He changed from the grocer Lehongre but kept the butcher,
fat Charles, because of his political opinions. After a month he
wanted all the cooking done with olive oil. Clemence joked that with
a Provencal like him you could never wash out the oil stains. He
wanted his omelets fried on both sides, as hard as pancakes. He
supervised mother Coupeau's cooking, wanting his steaks cooked like
shoe leather and with garlic on everything. He got angry if she
put herbs in the salad.

"They're just weeds and some of them might be poisonous," he declared.

His favorite soup was made with over-boiled vermicelli. He would pour
in half a bottle of olive oil.

Only he and Gervaise could eat this soup, the others being too
used to Parisian cooking.

Little by little Lantier also came to mixing himself up in the affairs
of the family. As the Lorilleuxs always grumbled at having to part
with the five francs for mother Coupeau, he explained that an
action could be brought against them.

They must think that they had a set of fools to deal with! It was ten
francs a month which they ought to give! And he would go up himself
for the ten francs so boldly and yet so amiably that the chainmaker
never dared refuse them. Madame Lerat also gave two five-franc pieces
now.

Mother Coupeau could have kissed Lantier's hands.

He was, moreover, the grand arbiter in all the quarrels between the
old woman and Gervaise.

Whenever the laundress, in a moment of impatience, behaved roughly
to her mother-in-law and the latter went and cried on her bed, he
hustled them about and made them kiss each other, asking them if
they thought themselves amusing with their bad tempers.

And Nana, too; she was being brought up badly, according to his
idea. In that he was right, for whenever the father spanked the child,
the mother took her part, and if the mother, in her turn, boxed her
ears, the father made a disturbance. Nana delighted at seeing her
parents abuse each other, and knowing that she was forgiven beforehand,
was up to all kinds of tricks. Her latest mania was to go and play
in the blacksmith shop opposite; she would pass the entire day
swinging on the shafts of the carts; she would hide with bands of
urchins in the remotest corners of the gray courtyard, lighted up
with the red glare of the forge; and suddenly she would reappear,
running and shouting, unkempt and dirty and followed by the troop of
urchins, as though a sudden clash of the hammers had frightened the
ragamuffins away. Lantier alone could scold her; and yet she knew
perfectly well how to get over him. This tricky little girl of ten
would walk before him like a lady, swinging herself about and casting
side glances at him, her eyes already full of vice.

He had ended by undertaking her education: he taught her to dance and
to talk patois.

A year passed thus. In the neighborhood it was thought that Lantier had
a private income, for this was the only way to account for the Coupeaus'
grand style of living. No doubt Gervaise continued to earn money; but
now that she had to support two men in doing nothing, the shop certainly
could not suffice; more especially as the shop no longer had so
good a reputation, customers were leaving and the workwomen were
tippling from morning till night. The truth was that Lantier paid
nothing, neither for rent nor board. During the first months he had
paid sums on account, then he had contented himself with speaking
of a large amount he was going to receive, with which later on he
would pay off everything in a lump sum. Gervaise no longer dared ask
him for a centime. She had the bread, the wine, the meat, all on
credit. The bills increased everywhere at the rate of three and
four francs a day. She had not paid a sou to the furniture dealer
nor to the three comrades, the mason, the carpenter and the painter.
All these people commenced to grumble, and she was no longer greeted
with the same politeness at the shops.The exact price could
not be fixed. The lawyers combined in saying that the absolute sum
of money to include all Ralph's interest in the estate could not be
named that side of Christmas. It was not to be thought of that any
actuary, or valuer, or lawyer, or conveyancer, should dispose of
so great a matter by a month's work. But something approaching to
a settlement might be made. A sum might be named as a minimum. And
a compact might be made, subject to the arbitration of a sworn
appraiser. A sum was named. The matter was carried so far, that Ralph
was told that he could sign away all his rights by the middle of
September,--sign away the entire property,--and have his pockets
filled with ample funds for the Moonbeam, and all other delights. He
might pay off Moggs and Neefit, and no longer feel that Polly,--poor
dear Polly,--was a millstone round his neck. And he would indeed, in
this event, be so well provided, that he did not for a moment doubt
that, if he chose so to circumscribe himself, Clarissa Underwood
might be his wife. All the savings of the Squire's life would be
his,--enough, as the opposing lawyer told him with eager pressing
words, to give him an estate of over a thousand a year at once. "And
it may be more,--probably will be more," said the lawyer. But at the
very least a sum approaching to thirty thousand pounds would be paid
over to him at once. And he might do what he pleased with this. There
was still a remnant of his own paternal property sufficient to pay
his debts.

But why should a man whose encumbrances were so trifling, sacrifice
prospects that were so glorious? Could he not part with a portion
of the estate,--with the reversion of half of it, so that the house
of Newton, Newton Priory, with its grouse and paddocks and adjacent
farms, might be left to him? If the whole were saleable, surely
so also must be the half. The third of the money offered to him
would more than suffice for all his wants. No doubt he might sell
the half,--but not to the Squire, nor could he effect such sale
immediately as he would do if the Squire bought it, nor on such
terms as were offered by the Squire. Money he might raise at once,
certainly; but it became by degrees as a thing certain to him, that
if once he raised money in that way, the estate would fly from him.
His uncle was a hale man, and people told him that his own life was
not so much better than his uncle's. His uncle had a great object,
and if Ralph chose to sell at all, that fact would be worth thousands
to him. But his uncle would not buy the reversion of half or of a
portion of the property. The Squire at last spoke his mind freely
on this matter to Sir Thomas. "It shall never be cast in my son's
teeth," he said, "that his next neighbour is the real man. Early in
life I made a mistake, and I have had to pay for it ever since. I am
paying for it now, and must pay for it to the end. But my paying for
it will be of small service if my boy has to pay for it afterwards."
Sir Thomas understood him and did not press the point.

Ralph was nearly driven wild with the need of deciding. Moggs's bill
at two months was coming due, and he knew that he could expect no
mercy there. To Neefit's establishment in Conduit Street he had gone
once, and had had words,--as Waddle had told to his rival. Neefit
was still persistent in his wishes,--still urgent that Newton should
go forth to Hendon like a man, and "pop" at once. "I'll tell you
what, Captain," said he;--he had taken to calling Ralph Captain, as a
goodly familiar name, feeling, no doubt, that Mister was cold between
father-in-law and son-in-law, and not quite daring to drop all
reverential title;--"if you're a little hard up, as I know you are,
you can have three or four hundred if you want it." Ralph did want it
sorely. "I know how you stand with old Moggs," said Neefit, "and I'll
see you all right there." Neefit was very urgent. He too had heard
something of these dealings among the lawyers. To have his Polly Mrs.
Newton of Newton Priory! The prize was worth fighting for. "Don't let
them frighten you about a little ready money, Captain. If it comes to
that, other folk has got ready money besides them."

"Your trust in me surprises me," said Ralph. "I already owe you money
which I can't pay you."

"I know where to trust, and I know where not to trust. If you'll once
say as how you'll pop the question to Polly, fair and honest, on
the square, you shall have five hundred;--bless me, if you shan't.
If she don't take you after all, why then I must look for my money
by-and-bye. If you're on the square with me, Captain, you'll never
find me hard to deal with."

"I hope I shall be on the square, at any rate."

"Then you step out to her and pop." Hereupon Ralph made a long and
intricate explanation of his affairs, the object of which was to
prove to Mr. Neefit that a little more delay was essential. He was so
environed by business and difficulties at the present moment that he
could take no immediate step such as Mr. Neefit suggested,--no such
step quite immediately. In about another fortnight, or in a month at
the furthest, he would be able to declare his purpose. "And how about
Moggs?" said Neefit, putting his hands into his breeches-pocket,
pulling down the corners of his mouth, and fixing his saucer eyes
full upon the young man's face. So he stood for some seconds, and
then came the words of which Waddle had spoken. Neefit could not
disentangle the intricacies of Ralph's somewhat fictitious story; but
he had wit enough to know what it meant. "You ain't on the square,
Captain. That's what you ain't," he said at last. It must be owned
that the accusation was just, and it was made so loudly that Waddle
did not at all exaggerate in saying that there had been words.
Nevertheless, when Ralph left the shop Neefit relented. "You come to
me, Captain, when Moggs's bit of stiff comes round."

A few days after that Ralph went to Sir Thomas, with the object of
declaring his decision;--at least Sir Thomas understood that such
was to be the purport of the visit. According to his ideas there
had been quite enough of delay. The Squire had been liberal in his
offer; and though the thing to be sold was in all its bearings so
valuable, though it carried with it a value which, in the eyes of
Sir Thomas,--and, indeed, in the eyes of all Englishmen,--was far
beyond all money price, though the territorial position was, for a
legitimate heir, almost a principality; yet, when a man cannot keep a
thing, what can he do but part with it? Ralph had made his bed, and
he must lie upon it. Sir Thomas had done what he could, but it had
all amounted to nothing. There was this young man a beggar,--but for
this reversion which he had now the power of selling. As for that
mode of extrication by marrying the breeches-maker's daughter,--that
to Sir Thomas was infinitely the worst evil of the two. Let Ralph
accept his uncle's offer and he would still be an English gentleman,
free to live as such, free to marry as such, free to associate with
friends fitting to his habits of life. And he would be a gentleman,
too, with means sufficing for a gentleman's wants. But that escape by
way of the breeches-maker's daughter would, in accordance with Sir
Thomas's view of things, destroy everything.

"Well, Ralph," he said, sighing, almost groaning, as his late ward
took the now accustomed chair opposite to his own.

"I wish I'd never been born," said Ralph, "and that Gregory stood in
my place."

"But you have been born, Ralph. We must take things as we find them."
Then there was a long silence. "I think, you know, that you should
make up your mind one way or the other. Your uncle of course feels
that as he is ready to pay the money at once he is entitled to an
immediate answer."

"I don't see that at all," said Ralph. "I am under no obligation to
my uncle, and I don't see why I am to be bustled by him. He is doing
nothing for my sake."

"He has, at any rate, the power of retracting."

"Let him retract."

"And then you'll be just where you were before,--ready to fall into
the hands of the Jews. If you must part with your property you cannot
do so on better terms."

"It seems to me that I shall be selling £7,000 a year in land for
about £1,200 a year in the funds."

"Just so;--that's about it, I suppose. But can you tell me when the
land will be yours,--or whether it will ever be yours at all? What is
it that you have got to sell? But, Ralph, it is no good going over
all that again."

"I know that, Sir Thomas."

"I had hoped you would have come to some decision. If you can save
the property of course you ought to do so. If you can live on what
pittance is left to you--"

"I can save it."

"Then do save it."

"I can save it by--marrying."

"By selling yourself to the daughter of a man who makes--breeches! I
can give you advice on no other point; but I do advise you not to do
that. I look upon an ill-assorted marriage as the very worst kind of
ruin. The literature of the Anglo-Saxon is rich in tributes to the dog,
as becomes a race which beyond any other has understood and developed
its four-footed companions.

Canine heroes whose intelligence and faithfulness our prose writers
have celebrated start to the memory in scores--Bill Sykes's
white shadow, which refused to be separated from its master even
by death; Rab, savagely devoted; the immortal Bob, "son of
battle"--true souls all, with hardly a villain among them for artistic
contrast.
Newton. He, too, had his ideas of his own
standing in the world, and had not been slow to assure himself
that the woman whom he might choose for his wife would be a fit
companion for any lady,--as long as the woman was neither vicious
nor disagreeable. He could make any woman a lady; he could, at any
rate, make Polly Neefit a lady. He rose from his seat, and prepared
to leave the room in disgust. "I won't trouble you by coming here
again," he said.

"You are welcome, Ralph," said Sir Thomas. "If I could assist you,
you would be doubly welcome."

"I know I have been a great trouble to you,--a thankless, fruitless,
worthless trouble. I shall make up my mind, no doubt, in a day or
two, and I will just write you a line. I need not bother you by
coming any more. Of course I think a great deal about it."

"No doubt," said Sir Thomas.

"Unluckily I have been brought up to know the value of what it is
I have to throw away. It is a kind of thing that a man doesn't do
without some regrets."

"They should have come earlier," said Sir Thomas.

"No doubt;--but they didn't, and it is no use saying anything more
about it. Good-day, sir." Then he flounced out of the room, impatient
of that single word of rebuke which had been administered to him.

Sir Thomas, as soon as he was alone, applied himself at once to the
book which he had reluctantly put aside when he was disturbed. But he
could not divest his mind of its trouble, as quickly as his chamber
had been divested of the presence of its troubler. He had said
an ill-natured word, and that grieved him. And then,--was he not
taking all this great matter too easily? If he would only put his
shoulder to the wheel thoroughly might he not do something to save
this friend,--this lad, who had been almost as his own son,--from
destruction? Would it not be a burden on his conscience to the last
day of his life that he had allowed his ward to be ruined, when by
some sacrifice of his own means he might have saved him? He sat and
thought of it, but did not really resolve that anything could be
done. He was wont to think in the same way of his own children, whom
he neglected. His conscience had been pricking him all his life, but
it hardly pricked him sharp enough to produce consequences.

During those very moments in which Ralph was leaving Southampton
Buildings he had almost made up his mind to go at once to Alexandria
Cottage, and to throw himself and the future fate of Newton Priory at
the feet of Polly Neefit. Two incidents in his late interview with
Sir Thomas tended to drive him that way. Sir Thomas had told him that
should he marry the daughter of a man who made--breeches, no lady
would associate with his wife. Sir Thomas also had seemed to imply
that he must sell his property. He would show Sir Thomas that he
could have a will and a way of his own. Polly Neefit should become
his wife; and he would show the world that no proudest lady in the
land was treated with more delicate consideration by her husband than
the breeches-maker's daughter should be treated by him. And when it
should please Providence to decide that the present squire of Newton
had reigned long enough over that dominion, he would show the world
that he had known something of his own position and the value of his
own prospects. Then Polly should be queen in the Newton dominions,
and he would see whether the ordinary world of worshippers would not
come and worship as usual. All the same, he did not on that occasion
go out to Alexandria Cottage.

When he reached his club he found a note from his brother.

   "They couldn't make me do it, even though I
went to prison," he said to himself. Let him starve till he died, and
then the property would go to Gregory! What did it matter? The thing
that did matter was this,--that the estate should not be allowed to
depart out of the true line of the Newton family. He sat thinking of
it half the night, and before he left the club he wrote the following
note to his brother;--


   September 9th, 186--.

   DEAR GREG.,--

   Be sure of this,--that I will not part with my interest in
   the property. I do not think that I can be forced, and I
   will never do it willingly. It may be that I may be driven
   to take advantage of your liberality and prudence. If so,
   I can only say that you shall share the property with me
   when it comes.

   Yours always,

   R. N.


This he gave to the porter of the club as he passed out; and then, as
he went home, he acknowledged to himself that it was tantamount to a
decision on his part that he would forthwith marry Polly Neefit.


CHAPTER XVIII.

WE WON'T SELL BROWNRIGGS.


On the 10th of September the Squire was informed that Ralph Newton
demanded another ten days for his decision, and that he had
undertaken to communicate it by letter on the 20th. The Squire
had growled, thinking that his nephew was unconscionable, and had
threatened to withdraw his offer. The lawyer, with a smile, assured
him that the matter really was progressing very quickly, that things
of that kind could rarely be carried on so expeditiously; and that,
in short, Mr. Newton had no fair ground of complaint. "When a man
pays through the nose for his whistle, he ought to get it!" said the
Squire, plainly showing that his idea as to the price fixed was very
different from that entertained by his nephew. But he did not retract
his offer. He was too anxious to accomplish the purchase to do that.
He would go home, he said, and wait till the 20th. Then he would
return to London. And he did go home.

On the first evening he said very little to his son. He felt that his
son did not quite sympathise with him, and he was sore that it should
be so. He could not be angry with his son. He knew well that this
want of sympathy arose from a conviction on this son's part that, let
what might be done in regard to the property, nothing could make him,
who was illegitimate, capable of holding the position in the country
which of right belonged to Newton of Newton. But the presence of this
feeling in the mind of the son was an accusation against himself
which was very grievous to him. Almost every act of his latter
life had been done with the object of removing the cause for such
accusation. To make his boy such as he would have been in every
respect had not his father sinned in his youth, had been the one
object of the father's life. And nobody gainsayed him in this but
that son himself. Nobody told him that all his bother about the
estate was of no avail. Nobody dared to tell him so. Parson Gregory,
in his letters to his brother, could express such an opinion. Sir
Thomas, sitting alone in his chamber, could feel it. Ralph, the
legitimate heir, with an assumed scorn, could declare to himself
that, let what might be sold, he would still be Newton of Newton. The
country people might know it, and the farmers might whisper it one
to another. But nobody said a word of this to the Squire. His own
lawyer never alluded to such a matter, though it was of course in his
thoughts. Nevertheless, the son, whom he loved so well, would tell
him from day to day,--indirectly, indeed, but with words that were
plain enough,--that the thing was not to be done. Men and women
called him Newton, because his father had chosen so to call him;--as
they would have called him Tomkins or Montmorenci, had he first
appeared before them with either of those names; but he was not a
Newton, and nothing could make him Newton of Newton Priory,--not even
the possession of the whole parish, and an habitation in the Priory
itself. "I wish you wouldn't think about it," the son would say to
the father;--and the expression of such a wish would contain the
whole accusation. What other son would express a desire that the
father would abstain from troubling himself to leave his estate
entire to his child?

On the morning after his return the necessary communication was made.
But it was not commenced in any set form. The two were out together,
as was usual with them, and were on the road which divided the two
parishes, Bostock from Newton. On the left of them was Walker's farm,
called the Brownriggs; and on the right, Darvell's farm, which was in
their own peculiar parish of Newton. "I was talking to Darvell while
you were away," said Ralph.

"What does he say for himself?"

"Nothing. It's the old story. He wants to stay, though he knows he'd
be better away."

"Then let him stay. Only I must have the place made fit to look at. A
man should have a chance of pulling through."

"Certainly, sir. I don't want him to go. I was only thinking it would
be better for his children that there should be a change. As for
making the place fit to look at, he hasn't the means. It's Walker's
work, at the other side, that shames him."

"One can't have Walkers on every farm," said the Squire. "No;--if
things go, as I think they will go, we'll pull down every stick and
stone at Brumby's,"--Brumby's was the name of Darvell's farm,--"and
put it up all ship-shape. The house hasn't been touched these twenty
years." Ralph said nothing. He knew well that his father would not
talk of building unless he intended to buy before he built. Nothing
could be more opposed to the Squire's purposes in life than the idea
of building a house which, at his death, would become the property of
his nephew. And, in this way, the estate was being starved. Allison
lay very still, smoothing his wife's hand, and looking out through
the open door at the dry grass of the yard, browner, dustier than
ever, and at the portulaca waving on top of the pyramid of
stones.
He could hear Jim's whistle as he moved about the yard; some one
at the back door was talking to Mary in a hushed, eager undertone;
over on her porch Dolly was singing happily, sinking her voice to
a mere murmur now and then at a low remonstrance from within
the house. It all made a sort of accompaniment to Gertrude's
happy talk.

Suddenly she stopped, and leaned her cheek against his, with a
little sigh.

"Isn't it a nice world, dear?" she whispered.

He turned so that he could look into her eyes, and said, with a
little tremble in his voice:

"It's a beautiful world!"

"Slipped through your fingers like that!

Like a--" Leverich's words were not fit for print. He had been
away for a couple of days, and now sat tilted back in his office
chair, a heavy, leather-covered thing not meant for tilting, his
face puffed with anger, his mouth snarling--a wild beast balked of
his prey.

His eyes, ferociously insolent, dwelt on Justin, who, fine and keen
and smiling a little, sat opposite him.

Brute anger never had any effect on Justin but to give him a
contemptuous, chill self-possession.

"You're sure the agreement's made?"
"Cater's been sending new consignments as fast as they could go
for the past three days; he's loaded up with machines."
Leverich swore again. "Confounded fools, not to have made terms with
Hardanger first! If we'd only known! If there was only some way to
put a spoke in the wheel, even yet!"
"Oh, I've got the spoke, easily enough," said Justin indifferently.

"The only trouble is, I can't use it."
"Got a spoke! Why in heaven didn't you say that before?" Leverich
came down on the front legs of his chair with a force that sent it
rolling ahead on its casters. "What are you sitting here for? What
do you mean by telling me that you can't use it?" 
"Just what I say."Well,--no; but then there are drawbacks. However, I shall only be
too glad to have it settled. I don't think, Ralph, you have ever
realised what it has been for me not to be able to lay out a shilling
on the property, as to which I was not satisfied that I should see it
back again in a year or two."

"And yet, sir, I have thought much about it."

"Thought! By heavens, I have thought of nothing else. As I stand
here, the place has hardly been worth the having to me, because of
such thinking. Your uncle, from the very first, was determined to
make it bitter enough. I shall never forget his coming to me when I
cut down the first tree. Was I going to build houses for a man's son
who begrudged me the timber I wanted about the place?"

"He couldn't stop you there."

"But he said he could,--and he tried. And if I wanted to change a
thing here or there, was it pleasant, do you think, to have to go to
him? And what pleasure could there be in doing anything when another
was to have it all? But you have never understood it, Ralph. Well;--I
hope you'll understand it some day. If this goes right, nobody shall
ever stop you in cutting a tree. You shall be free to do what you
please with every sod, and every branch, and every wall, and every
barn. I shall be happy at last, Ralph, if I think that you can enjoy
it." Then there was again a silence, for tears were in the eyes both
of the father and of the son. "Indeed," continued the Squire, as he
rubbed the moisture away, "my great pleasure, while I remain, will be
to see you active about the place. As it is now, how is it possible
that you should care for it?"

"But I do care for it, and I think I am active about it."

him."

Even yet there had been no clear statement as to what had been done
between father and son. There was so much of clinging, trusting,
perfect love in the father's words towards the son, that the latter
could not bear to say a word that should produce sorrow. When the
Squire declared that Ralph should have it all, free,--to do just as
he pleased with it, with all the full glory of ownership, Ralph could

Mrs. Byrne expressed her emotion and showed her tact by silently
compressing her lips.

positively stated that the reversion would not be sold. Throughout
the morning the Squire went on speaking of his hopes, and saying that
this and that should be done the very moment that the contract was
signed; at last Ralph spoke out, when, on some occasion, his father
reproached him for indifference. "I do so fear that you will be
disappointed," he said.

"Why should I be disappointed?"

"It is not for my own sake that I fear, for in truth the arrangement,
as it stands, is no bar to my enjoyment of the place."

"But Ralph has told him so."

"Ralph will say anything. He doesn't mind what lies he tells."

"I think you are too hard on him," said the son.

"Well;--we shall see. But what is it that Ralph has said? And when

said the Squire, angrily. "Put it how you will, he is lying either
to me or to his brother;--probably to both of us. His word either on
one side or on the other is worth nothing. I believe he will take my
money because he wants money, and because he likes money. As for what

the hall were as follows:--"Bother about the church. I'm half sick of

fads about not shooting."

"There are no new fads, uncle Greg, and I'll be with you by twelve
o'clock," said the parson.
