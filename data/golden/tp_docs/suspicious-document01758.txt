Naturally I couldn't tell the part of my story which concerned Potter
Parker; but I said that Mrs. Ess Kay wanted me to do things which I
didn't think it right to do, and I couldn't stay in her house even a
day longer.

"I should like to go home," I went on, "but I can't yet, and the only
other thing is to join Miss Woodburn in Chicago. You remember Miss
Woodburn, don't you?"

He said he remembered her very well, had read in the newspapers that
she had left Newport for Chicago, and thought it was a wise idea of
mine to join her.

"I'm glad you think that," said I, "for I want to start to-day; and I
hope you'll tell me how to go, how much money it will be, how long it
takes to get there, and all about it."

He didn't answer for a minute, but sat looking very grave, staring at
his brown hand on the white tablecloth, as if he'd never seen it
before. Then he said:

"Curiously enough, I am going West this afternoon too. Would you object
to my being in the same train? I wouldn't suggest such a thing, only
you see as you're a stranger in the country, I might be able to help
you a little."

"How splendid!" I exclaimed. "It seems almost too good to be true. You
can't fancy what a relief it is to my mind."

He looked pleased at that, and said I was very kind, though I should
have thought it was the other way round.

"I'll get your ticket then," he went on. "If you'll give me twenty-five
dollars--five pounds, you know--I'll hand you back the change; but I'm
afraid it won't be much."

"Change?" I echoed. "Why, I supposed it would be ever so much more than
five pounds to get to Chicago, which is almost in Central America,
isn't it?"

"The people who live there think it's central," said Mr. Brett. "But
they make the railroad men keep prices down, so that dissatisfied New
Yorkers can afford to go and live there. It isn't a bad journey, you'll
find. I think it will interest you. You sleep and eat in the train, you
know."

"What fun!" I exclaimed. "I've never slept in a train, even on the
Continent."

"If you had, it would be different from this one," said he. "Can you be
ready in twenty-five minutes? The train which we call the Twentieth
Century, starts at 2.45."

"I'm ready now," said I. "The sooner we're on the way the better. But
oh, about Vivace. Will they allow him to sleep and eat too?"

"I expect I can arrange that," Mr. Brett answered, in such a confident
way that I felt sure he could do it, or anything else he set out to do.
It really was lucky for me that he happened to be travelling West that
same day, and such an extraordinary coincidence, too.

"Are you going on journalistic business?" I asked.

"No, it's business I'm undertaking for a friend," he explained. "But I
hope to get something good for myself out of it in the end."

"Oh, I do hope you will," I replied. "I'm sure you deserve to."

"I'm sure I don't," said he, laughing. "But I shall try hard for it,
all the same. You know, you told me to be ambitious."

"I know I did," I answered.

A moment later he said that he must hurry off and attend to the
tickets, and I had only time to glance through some papers the waiter
brought me, with columns full of Mohunsleigh's marriage, when he was
back again with a cab.

Copy the rough map fig. 2, and put the fleur-de-lys all over the middle
of it, extinguishing the Romans (fig.
3).

This battle was won by Clovis, I believe, before he married Clotilde.
He wins his princess by it: cannot get his pretty vase, however,
to present to her. Keep that story well in your mind, and the
battle of Soissons, as winning mid-France for the French, and ending
the Romans there, for ever. Secondly, after he marries Clotilde, the
wild Germans attack _him_ from the north, and he has to fight for life
and throne at Tolbiac.

This is the battle in which he prays to the God of Clotilde, and quits
himself of the Germans by His help. Whereupon he is crowned in
Rheims by St.

Remy.

[Illustration: Plate I. THE DYNASTIES OF FRANCE.]

And now, in the new strength of his Christianity, and his twin victory
over Rome and Germany, and his love for his queen, and his ambition
for his people, he looks south on that vast Visigothic power, between
Loire and the snowy mountains.

Shall Christ, and the Franks, not be stronger than villainous
Visigoths 'who are Arians also'?

All his Franks are with him, in that opinion.

So he marches against the Visigoths, meets them and their Alaric at
Poitiers, ends their Alaric and their Arianism, and carries his
faithful Franks to the Pic du Midi.

And so now you must draw the map of France once more, and put the
fleur-de-lys all over its central mass from Calais to the Pyrenees:
only Brittany still on the west, Burgundy in the east, and the white
Provence rose beyond Rhone. And now poor little Amiens has become
a mere border town like our Durham, and Somme a border streamlet
like our Tyne. Loire and Seine have become the great French rivers,
and men will be minded to build cities by these; where the well-watered
plains, not of peat, but richest pasture, may repose under the guard
of saucy castles on the crags, and moated towers on the islands. But
now let us think a little more closely what our changed symbols
in the map may mean--five fleur-de-lys for level bar.There was nothing at the time, but she didn't
go away. She looked about for a minute, then pouncing on the palm leaf
she began to fan me, slowly and gracefully, not holding on by anything,
though the train was hurling itself through the State of New York
apparently with the speed in which light travels round the world. (I
never could remember how many times it can do the whole distance in a
minute, but whatever it is, it has the air of being a boast.)

I thanked her a good deal, and said I wouldn't trouble her any more,
though it was very nice; but she kept straight on, like a mechanical
doll, until I felt that in common humanity I ought to fan her. If
anyone in England, especially anyone in her position (only there aren't
such positions) had asked half as many questions as she did, people
would be extremely surprised and offended; but I would defy even the
crossest person to be offended with this soft brown thing. It would
have been too ungrateful not to answer her nicely when she was keeping
my flies at bay with extreme inconvenience to herself, so I admitted
that I was English, told what county I came from, how long I'd been in
the States, where I'd been staying, how I liked America, where I was
going now, and ended up by satisfying her as to my age and whether I
had a mother. I also stated that I was neither married nor engaged. The
dear creature rewarded me for all this by telling me a great deal about
herself and her relatives, and a church picnic she attended last
Sunday, where there were more young gentlemen than ladies--"which
always makes parties so nice for us girls."

"I must say that's a mighty pretty hat you've got," said she at last.
"I reckon it came from England. And my, but that _is_ a sweet waist.
I'd give my life for that waist."

If I had had a twin sister of the sweet waist with me, I couldn't have
resisted pressing it upon her, and I don't believe she would have
refused.

As soon as Mr. Brett got me nicely settled in my room, he said we
wouldn't meet again during the journey. I was sorry and wanted to know
why, so he explained that his ticket was different from mine. I hope
that is the only reason, really, and that it isn't because he thinks he
ought not to be travelling with me. I suppose he is going second class.

I did miss him at dinner, which I had in a grand restaurant car, about
half a mile away from me in the train. It was fun being there, seeing
all the people, and being served by fascinating black waiters, but it
would have been more fun with him. I longed to exclaim to Mr. Brett
about the glorious sunset which marched with us along the Hudson River
for an enchanted hour, and I couldn't half enjoy it for wondering every
minute, as it changed from one beauty to another, whether he were
watching too.

We have tenderly radiant sunsets at home, which I love; but they're not
startlingly magnificent as in America, where all things--even cloud
effects--are managed on such a sensational scale. I saw some skies to
remember, in Newport, though never one like this; but perhaps the
magical charm of it was partly dependent on the gleaming river.

When the daylight blue had faded, there was a kind of dusky lull. Then,
as if flames leaped up out of the clear water, river and mountains and
sky ran gold, reddening slowly till the colour burned deep and vivid as
the heart of a rose. From crimson was born violet, soft blue-violet
that hung like a robe over the mountains, while the living azure of the
river was slashed with silver; and as one gazed and gazed, afraid to
turn away, there broke a sudden flood of amethyst light out of the
floating haze. It was dazzling for a moment, but before one realised
the change the brilliance had been drunk up by purple shadows. The
outline of trees and foot-hills melted into the pansy gloom, and at
last, with one dying quiver of light all warmth of colour was blotted
out. Water and sky paled to a pensive grey-blue, and as the French say,
"it made night."

There was a tremendous menu for dinner, such as we used to have for
breakfast on shipboard, and droves of things whose names I'd never
heard before. Just for curiosity, I ordered several of the strangest,
and some of them were a great success. For instance, there was
"succotash," which sounds as if it might be a guttural insult flung at
the mouth of one Red Indian Brave by another; but when it was
(figuratively speaking) flung at mine by a black waiter, it turned out
to be something more in the nature of a compliment. It looked like
beryls mixed with pearls, though it was really only green beans stirred
up with American corn; and the two got on so well together you felt
they had been born for each other.

It's now about two o'clock in the morning, and it seems as if we must
have raced across half America, but we have a long, long way to go
still, so says the soft brown thing, who looked in on me about an hour
ago to ask in a casual way whether, if she should go to Europe to live,
she might not be taken for an Italian?

When I was a little girl, and my nurse used to make up tales to put me
to sleep at night, I would sometimes get impatient and tell her to "go
down into the story and find out what happened next." Just now, I feel
as if that is what I should like to do in my future.


XV

ABOUT SEEING CHICAGO


The first face I saw on the platform when we arrived in Chicago was Mr.
Brett's. He was waiting to help me, and looked as fresh as if he hadn't
spent eighteen hours in the train. He said I looked fresh, too; but if
I did it must have been excitement, as I'd written half the night and
dreamed desperately the other half, about Potter Parker--dressed like
one of those Red Indians they have for cigar signs in New
York--pursuing me with a jewelled tomahawk.

Mr. Brett had insisted on my telegraphing to Sally before we left New
York, to say I was coming, and asking her to meet the train, therefore,
we were surprised not to find her at the station. I was rather anxious,
and so I could see was Mr. Brett. He thought he had better not drive in
a cab with me to the friend's house where she was staying, but he told
me the name of a hotel where he would go at once, and made me promise
that I would send him a line by the cabman to say whether everything
was well with me.

"Miss Woodburn probably has a headache, or perhaps is out of town for
the day," said he. "It can't be anything else; still, I shall be a
little uneasy till I hear. And you know I hold myself absolutely at
your service."

"What about your friend whose business you've come to attend to?" I
asked. "I mustn't be so selfish as to interfere with that, whatever
happens."

"Oh, I can attend to both interests," he assured me, "without
neglecting either. I shan't need to let one interfere with the other.
And remember, I won't stir out of my hotel till I've had your note."

Bereft of him, Chicago overawed me, and took my breath away. It is a
good thing I saw New York first, for if I'd come straight from England
with only memories of peaceful London to support me through the ordeal,
I don't know but it might have affected my brain.

For one thing, there was a high wind which seemed to have a fancy for
making off with your hat. It was an exciting sort of wind, too, which
played with your nerves; but whether it was that, or whether something
extraordinary was happening just out of sight round the corner of
nearly every street we passed, and all the people we saw were tearing
like mad to the spot, I don't know, but anyhow they seemed a good deal
agitated, and there were more varieties of startling street noises even
than in New York. The cable cars were like live, untamed things that
scorned to wait the convenience of wretched little human beings. Such
women and girls as had performed the feat of clambering on board didn't
dream for a moment that the creatures might be induced to stop and let
them get down. They simply hurled themselves off as they could, and my
heart was in my mouth for them, and for myself, many times while my cab
mingled with the surging and apparently uncontrolled traffic.

It was a long drive, though, and as I had time to calm down I saw that
numbers of the huge buildings are nobly designed, and very magnificent
in decoration, making a splendid effect in spite of their vast size
rather than because of it. And such shops, too! They're like the fairy
palaces my nurse used to tell me about, as big as whole cities, where
you could get anything you wanted just by wishing.

On the way, I made up my mind to ask Sally a number of questions; why
they have the curbstones so high in Chicago; why the women, though
dressed much the same as in New York, look quite different and have a
style of their own, even in their walk; why almost all the men are
young; and why, though there is such a network of trams, nearly
everybody seems to need a motor car?

I think American girls must be braver than English ones, for where with
us, if a girl drives a motor she is so remarkable that her picture is
at once put in a newspaper, in the States a girl in a car, in the midst
of howling traffic, doesn't even have the air of wanting to scream or
faint, but just sits straight up and smiles with her figure looking
inexpressibly French; and there are two or three of her in every
important street.

There was a wonderful swinging bridge which we had to wait for until it
chose to come to us, like the mountain to Mahomet, and presently we
trotted into a beautiful Avenue near a startlingly unexpected blue sea
which I thought must be a mirage, till the cabman said it was Lake
Michigan. But who would have thought of a lake being like that? The
only ones I ever saw were pretty little things in parks where you fed
swans.

At last we stopped before a large, handsome house, with a lawn round it
and no fence. The house was stone in front, but had brick sides which
gave it a queer effect, yet somehow didn't spoil it; and wherever there
wasn't a porch, it had broken out in bow windows.

I told the cabman to wait, and then ran up the four or five steps to
ring the front door bell. In a minute a maid came who would have been
very smart-looking if she had only worn a proper cap.

"Is Miss Woodburn stopping here?" I asked.

"No, she isn't," returned the young woman with a glint of the eye which
seemed to say, she would perish sooner than call anyone "Miss," and I
shouldn't wonder if she would have felled me to the earth rather than
give me a "ladyship" had it been required of her.

"Are you _sure_?" I persisted, my heart preparing for a plunge
bootward.

"I guess so," said the girl with a superior but not ill-natured smile.
"She _was_ staying with us, but she went day before yesterday. I don't
think she'll be back, because she's gone to take care of a friend who's
real sick, way back in Ohio somewhere."

"Way back in Ohio somewhere!" The words were like a knell for all my
hopes. I didn't know what was to become of me now.

"Like yours," I thought; but I didn't say it. I said instead that I was
fond of simple ways. And I asked where the place was, and if it was far
off?

"It will take us about twelve hours to get there," he answered.

"Us?" I echoed. "Why, you can't----"

"I can if you'll let me," said, he, growing red. "I've finished my
business in Chicago, already, and----"

"What, while I was away?"

"It was a short affair, though important."

"But I thought you weren't going to leave the hotel till I wrote?"

"I didn't need to. My friend came to me, and we fixed up everything
between us in a few minutes. Now, I'm free again; and my idea in any
case was to drop in on my Ohio cousins. You see, twelve hours'
travelling is nothing to us Americans, and they wouldn't like it if I
didn't just say 'how do you do,' when I'm so near."

"Oh, well, if that's really true, and you aren't doing it only to help
me," said I, with a sigh of relief. "I was afraid you were. I shouldn't
mind the journey a bit if you were with me; but I do hope we'll have
the same kind of ticket this time. Do get mine like yours, won't you?"

His eyes had a beautiful expression in them as he thanked me, and said
he would do the best he could; only I couldn't exactly make it out. I
hoped it wasn't pity, but I'm afraid it may have been, as I must have
seemed rather forlorn, depending so entirely upon him.

"The best train to take would be this evening," he went on. "That would
give my cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Trowbridge, plenty of time to get ready
for you too, for I'll wire them that you're coming. But how could you
pass the day? Would you--let me show you the sights of Chicago?"

"_Would_ I? It would be the best of fun. Oh, I _am_ glad I came, after
all."

"Then that's settled. I'll send off that telegram and one or two
others, and come back with an automobile. Don't look like that, please,
Lady Betty. It isn't going to cost me all I've got to hire one. They're
cheap here; besides I know a man who will give me one for the day, for
next to nothing. And I'll bring you one of those silk things with talc
windows to wear over your head and face, so no one will see that Lady
Betty Bulkeley is 'doing' Chicago to-day."

"I don't know a soul here," said I. "And anyway I wouldn't be ashamed.
I shall be doing no wrong."

"Of course not, or I hope I wouldn't have proposed it," said Mr. Brett.

Then he went away, and in about half an hour he was back with the
promised motor hood and a dust coat, both of which he said were thrown
in with the car for anyone who hired it, if desired.

I was as pleased as Punch. As Caro Pitchley said when she was engaged,
I felt I was "going to have _the_ time of my life." And it _was_ fun. I
shall never forget that day of mine in Chicago with Mr. Brett, if I
live to be a hundred.

The only sight I did not want to see was the poor pigs walking into a
trough wagging their tails and coming out of another one eventually as
a string of sausages or something. But we didn't miss any of the other
sights, and there were enough to last us from morning till evening
without stopping once. We bowled along wide boulevards, and saw Lincoln
Park, and the Midway and Jackson Park. We had things to eat on the lake
shore near a pier, and afterwards we had ice cream in the old German
Building of the World's Fair. There were some beautiful lagoons, and
Mr. Brett rowed me about in a boat. I should have liked to stop there
for hours, but there were too many other things to do. We had to see
Sans Souci, a sort of Chicago Coney Island, which was a tremendous
lark, with Helter Skelters, and Air Ships, and a Laughing Gallery and a
trip to Hades. I wouldn't miss anything, and Mr. Brett must have found
me a handful, I'm afraid, though I do think he enjoyed it almost as
much as I did. Usually he is rather grave, but before half the day was
gone he was like a boy. We talked together as if we had been friends
for years and told each other anecdotes of our past lives. He didn't
care about talking of himself, but I made him by asking questions, and
refusing to tell things about myself unless he would. I found it a
great deal more interesting to listen to such stories than to hear
about the history of Chicago, and he has had the most extraordinarily
interesting life. [Footnote 14: Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Constantius;
and after the division of the empire, to the East, Justinian. "The emperor
Justinian was born of an obscure race of Barbarians, the inhabitants
of a wild and desolate country, to which the names of Dardania, of
Dacia, and of Bulgaria have been successively applied. The names of
these Dardanian peasants are Gothic, and almost English. Justinian is a
translation of Uprauder (upright); his father, Sabatius,--in Græco-barbarous
language, Stipes--was styled in his village 'Istock' (Stock)."

--Gibbon, beginning of chap. xl. and note.]
16. The _truth_, and the fire, of the Frank,--I must repeat with
insistence,--for my younger readers have probably been in the habit of
thinking that the French were more polite than true. They will find,
if they examine into the matter, that only Truth _can_ be polished:
and that all we recognize of beautiful, subtle, or constructive,
in the manners, the language, or the architecture of the French,
comes of a pure veracity in their nature, which you will soon feel
in the living creatures themselves if you love them: if you understand
even their worst rightly, their very Revolution was a revolt against
lies; and against the betrayal of Love.

No people had ever been so loyal in vain.

17. That they were originally Germans, they themselves I suppose would
now gladly forget; but how they shook the dust of Germany off
their feet--and gave themselves a new name--is the first of the phenomena
which we have now attentively to observe respecting them.

"The most rational critics," says Mr. Gibbon in his tenth chapter,
"_suppose_ that _about_ the year 240" (_suppose_ then, we, for our
greater comfort, say _about_ the year 250, half-way to end of fifth
century, where we are,--ten years less or more, in cases of 'supposing
about,' do not much matter, but some floating buoy of a date will
be handy here.)

'About' A.D. 250, then, "a new confederacy was formed, under the name
of Franks, by the old inhabitants of the lower Rhine and the Weser."

18. My own impression, concerning the old inhabitants of the lower
Rhine and the Weser, would have been that they consisted mostly of
fish, with superficial frogs and ducks; but Mr. Gibbon's note on the
passage informs us that the new confederation composed itself of
human creatures, in these items following.

1. The Chauci, who lived we are not told where.

2. The Sicambri " in the Principality of Waldeck.

3. The Attuarii " in the Duchy of Berg.

4. The Bructeri " on the banks of the Lippe.

5. The Chamavii " in the country of the Bructeri.

6. The Catti " in Hessia.

All this I believe you will be rather easier in your minds if you
forget than if you remember; but if it please you to read, or
re-read, (or best of all, get read to you by some real Miss Isabella
Wardour,) the story of Martin Waldeck in the 'Antiquary,' you will gain
from it a sufficient notion of the central character of "the
Principality of _Waldeck_" connected securely with that important
German word; 'woody'--or 'wood_ish_,' I suppose?

--descriptive of rock and half-grown forest; together with some wholesome
reverence for Scott's instinctively deep foundations of
nomenclature.

19.

But for our present purpose we must also take seriously to our maps
again, and get things within linear limits of space.

All the maps of Germany which I have myself the privilege of
possessing, diffuse themselves, just north of Frankfort, into the
likeness of a painted window broken small by Puritan malice, and
put together again by ingenious churchwardens with every bit of
it wrong side upwards;--this curious vitrerie purporting to represent
the sixty, seventy, eighty, or ninety dukedoms, marquisates, counties,
baronies, electorates, and the like, into which hereditary Alemannia
cracked itself in that latitude.

Then he
looked as if he were going to say something else, but shut his lips
tight together and didn't. One wouldn't dare speak out the truth like
this, to a rich man one might be supposed to be trying to marry; I
remember enough of what Mother and Vic have told me about proper
behaviour in a débutante, to know that. But I've never wanted to talk
in such a way to any man except Mr. Brett, which is lucky, as he always
understands me; and that's one reason why it's pleasanter to be with
him than any other person I've ever met yet.


XVI

ABOUT THE VALLEY FARM


After all, Mr. Brett's ticket was different from mine again, but I
suppose he couldn't arrange to have the same kind and see something of
me on the journey, because, as I'd asked him, he would have done it if
possible. We went back part of the way we had come the night before, in
the same grand kind of train, as far as Cleveland, which we reached in
the morning, quite early. We got out there, for no fine trains like
that stop at the village near which Mr. Brett's cousins live, and he
said the best thing we could do would be to drive to the farm in a
motor car. It was about forty miles away, but with a good car which he
could easily get, we wouldn't be more than two hours, allowing for bad
roads. If we didn't take a motor, we should have to wait half the
morning for a slow train, and then have a drive at the end, of six or
seven miles in some kind of a country conveyance.

When I hesitated, thinking of expense, Mr. Brett explained that among
his many other occupations, he had once acted as a chauffeur,
therefore, knowing the tricks of the trade and being a sort of
professional himself, he could always hire a motor at a nominal price.
This settled my doubts. We drove in a cab to a hotel, where he left me,
with Vivace, while he went to search for a car. Presently he came back
with a smart grey thing which matched my clothes; and not only was
there a grey chauffeur to go with it, but a grey holland coat for me,
and a grey silk hood with a lace curtain. I do think they do things
well in America.

Mr. Brett wanted to know if I would like a short run about Cleveland
before starting, so I said yes, as I love seeing new things; and it was
beautiful. I don't remember learning Cleveland on the map of the States
when I did geography, so I hadn't realised that it could be important.
But Bournemouth and Folkeston and Harrogate rolled into one wouldn't
fill it, and Cleveland is a great deal grander than any of them. Even
Bellevue Avenue in Newport is hardly handsomer than Euclid; but what an
odd name to give a street! But to me the names of streets in America
don't sound as interesting and individual as ours do.

I looked forward to seeing the country between Cleveland and Aristo
(which is the name of the town nearest to the Valley Farm) because
except for the drives I had had near Newport, I knew nothing at all of
the real country in America. I had an idea that we should pass some
fine country houses and see a number of pretty little nestling
villages.

The name of Aristo was rather impressive and classical sounding, I
thought, and I had visions of meeting on the way pretty girls driving
or riding, and good-looking, well-groomed men such as I had met always
in the country round Newport. But as we went on and on, I was
disappointed. The scenery itself was lovely, rich, and peaceful, with
groves of maple trees which would have been quite new to me if I hadn't
seen a few in the East; but the villages were blots rather than beauty
spots, and we saw only peasants and farm people.

Mr. Brett was driving the car with me beside him, while the chauffeur
sat behind, and I made some such remark to him before I stopped to
remember that his relatives were farm people. I could have bitten my
tongue then, but he didn't seem to be offended.

"Outside the towns in the West there are few of what _you_ would call
gentlefolk," said he, with just the faintest emphasis of good-natured
scorn for English prejudice; "nor are there any 'country houses' as you
understand the name in England. Here people live in the country to till
the land and to live by tilling it; yet they don't call themselves
'peasants,' either. It isn't that they're snobbish and want to seem to
be what they are not, don't think that for a moment. But they--well, I
won't try to describe them. Many people from the Old World would never
understand what they really are, or their point of view; but you will,
Lady Betty. You are quick, and sympathetic, and intelligent; and when I
ask you to define for me the difference between the farmers of Ohio, as
typified by my cousins and their neighbours in Summer County, I shall
be surprised if you don't exactly hit the nail on the head. They'll
surprise you a little at first, I warn you, and for about ten minutes
maybe you won't know what to make of them. But I count on you to see
the point in spite of all your traditions."

"What have my traditions got to do with it?" I asked.

"Wait and see."

I laughed. "Well, I only wish I knew what my traditions are," said I.
"I suppose I ought to know, but I don't think I do."

"You may feel them prickling up and down your spine for a bit, while
you're getting used to a new order of things at the Valley Farm,"
answered Mr. Brett. "And yet I don't know. I shall be enormously
interested in watching the effect upon you, before I--have to say
good-bye."

I forgot everything else he had been saying when I heard that last
sentence.

"Will you have to say good-bye soon?" I asked in a crestfallen voice.

He didn't speak for a minute, perhaps on account of a series of bumps
in the road which, though so pretty, was much worse for driving than
any I have seen at home. [Sidenote: EXAMPLE other OF RANKE] new. meet

man.At last he said, "To tell you the truth, Lady Betty, I should like to
stop and pay my cousins a little visit, but--I don't know if I have a
right to."

"Oh, why not?" I asked. "Wouldn't they be delighted to keep you?"

"Perhaps. I hope so. But what about you?"

"If it depended one bit on me, you'd make a _long_ visit."

"Wouldn't you really mind seeing me hanging around--sometimes? Just at
meals, you know--or to take you a drive once in awhile?"
