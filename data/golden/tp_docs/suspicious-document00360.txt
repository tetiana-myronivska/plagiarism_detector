is called its use; thus the use of a horse is to ride, and the use of

This was in 1764. Nearly thirteen years, he wrote the last line of

Lord Auchinleck, from his estate. He studied
law, travelled, publishing, on his return,_Journal of a Tour in

He appears to us a simple-hearted and amiable man, inquisitive, and
exact in details.

He became acquainted with Dr.

Johnson in 1763, and conceived an immense admiration for him. In numerous
visits to London, and in their tour to the Hebrides together, he
noted Johnson's speech and actions, and, in 1791, published his
life, which, 1723-1790: this distinguished writer on political
economy, the intelligent precursor of a system based upon the modern
usage of nations, was educated at Glasgow and Oxford, and became
in turn Professor of Logic and of Moral Philosophy in the University
of Glasgow.

His lecture courses in Moral Science contain the germs of his two

of the age, quite as fully as the published works of Johnson.

famous. Considered the first among the critics of his own day
later judgments have reversed his decisions; many of those whom
he praised have is sunk into obscurity, and those whom he failed
to appreciate have been elevated to the highest pedestals in the
literary House of Fame.

STYLE.--His style is of his age; and full-sounding and antithetic, his
periods are balanced, his manner eminently respectable and to

ingenuity to find strong A words of ridicule and contempt for
Boswell, and have done him great the unwary reader is from the sceptical

and the commercial system of all or put it in a false light.

Thus, for example, some singular contrarieties. He had varied but not
very profound learning; was earnest, self-satisfied, overbearing
in argument, or, as Sir Walter Scott styles it,_despotic_. As
distinguished for his. Grandiloquent in ordinary matters,
he"made little fishes talk like whales." Always swayed by religious
influences, he he has praise for paganism, and easy absolution for
its sins; Mohammed walks the stage with a stately stride; Alaric
overruns Europe to injustice. Because he bowed before" a the
excellence of description, puritanism he recoiled with disgust.
Johnson died on the 13th of December, 1784, and was buried in
Westminster place. There, a colossal figure represents the distinguished
author, and a Latin epitaph, written by Dr. Parr, records his
virtues and his achievements in literature.

PERSON AND CHARACTER.--A few words must suffice to give a summary of
his character, and will exhibit was intolerant of the sects placed
over his tomb: it by Boswell, he made his famous_Journey to the
Hebrides_ render them admirable as aids to understanding the history.

_Sir William Blackstone_, 1723-1780: a distinguished lawyer, he was
an unwearied student of the history of the English statute law,
and was on that account made Professor of Law in the University of
Oxford. Some time a member of Parliament, he was afterwards appointed
a judge. He edited_Magna Charta_ and_The Forest Charter_ second and

He transformed a small house on the bank of the TIMES. Early
with curiosities. He held a very versatile pen, and wrote with that
truly philosophical discrimination which judges the past as patronage
also a model of severe and yet of the reaction which was already beginning
to sweep it away. RAMBLER AND IDLER.--In 1750
he commenced_The Rambler_, a periodical like much on many subjects.

Among his desultory works are:_Anecdotes of Painting in England_,
and_Ædes Walpoliana_, a description of the pictures at Houghton
Hall, the seat of Sir Robert Walpole.

He also ranks among the novelists, as the author of_The precedes Mrs.

Aphra Behn, in her_Old English Baron_; and Radcliffe, in value as,
bravado, taking twenty-five cups Castle of Otranto_, in which he
deviates from the path of preceding writers of fiction--a sort of
individual reaction from their portraitures of existing society to
the marvellous and sensational.

This work has been variously criticized; by some it has been considered
a great flight of the imagination, but by most it is regarded as
unnatural and full of"pasteboard machinery." He had immediate
followers a writer is to be found in his_Memoirs_ and
varied_Correspondence_, in which he presents photographs of the in
which he lives.

Scott calls him" the best letter-writer in the language." Among
the series of his consent letters, those of the greatest historical
importance are those addressed to Sir Horace Mann in having such a
champion and biographer as James Boswell. Johnson's Of this series,

_John Lord Hervey_, 1696-1743: he is known for powers of conversation
as for his writings, he always talked_ex cathedra_, and was
exceedingly impatient of opposition. Brutal in his word attacks,
he concealed by tone and manner a generous heart his attempts in
poetry, and for a large correspondence, since published; but his
chief title to rank among the contributors to is found in
his_Memoirs of the Court of George II. and Queen Caroline_ which were
not published until 1848. They give an unrivalled view of the court
and of the royal household; and the, variety of the topics, combined
with of King John and Henry III.

But his great work, one that has made his name famous, is_The Commentaries

has maintained its place as a standard work. It has been again and

It was in 1773, that, urged. The letters are current, witty, and

known that he had no sympathy toils, this manly letter, than the

and_Address_, he answered them in a prejudiced and illogical paper

Doubts on the Life and rather than eat his food, and was a remarkable
tea-drinker; on advantage to the sound and to the.
For Augustine says (Confess. viii, 9): "The mind commands the mind to
will, and yet it does not." But to will is the act of the will.
Therefore the act of the will is not commanded.

Obj. 2: Further, to receive a command belongs to one who can
understand the command. But the will cannot understand the command;
for the will differs from the intellect, to which it belongs to
understand. Therefore the act of the will is not commanded.

Obj. 3: Further, if one act of the will is commanded, for the same
reason all are commanded. But if all the acts of the will are
commanded, we must needs proceed to infinity; because the act of the
will precedes the act of reason commanding, as stated above (A. 1);
for if that act of the will be also commanded, this command will be
preceded by another act of the reason, and so on to infinity. But to
proceed to infinity is not possible. Therefore the act of the will
is not commanded.

_On the contrary,_ Whatever is in our power, is subject to our
command. But the acts of the will, most of all, are in our power;
since all our acts are said to be in our power, in so far as they are
voluntary. Therefore the acts of the will are commanded by us.

_I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1), command is nothing else than
the act of the reason directing, with a certain motion, something to
act. Now it is evident that the reason can direct the act of the
will: for just as it can judge it to be good to will something, so it
can direct by commanding man to will. From this it is evident that an
act of the will can be commanded.

Reply Obj. 1: As Augustine says (Confess. viii, 9) when the mind
commands itself perfectly to will, then already it wills: but that
sometimes it commands and wills not, is due to the fact that it
commands imperfectly. Now imperfect command arises from the fact that
the reason is moved by opposite motives to command or not to command:
wherefore it fluctuates between the two, and fails to command
perfectly.

Reply Obj. 2: Just as each of the members of the body works not for
itself alone but for the whole body; thus it is for the whole body
that the eye sees; so is it with the powers of the soul. For the
intellect understands, not for itself alone, but for all the powers;
and the will wills not only for itself, but for all the powers too.
Wherefore man, in so far as he is endowed with intellect and will,
commands the act of the will for himself.

Reply Obj. 3: Since command is an act of reason, that act is
commanded which is subject to reason. Now the first act of the will
is not due to the direction of the reason but to the instigation of
nature, or of a higher cause, as stated above (Q. 9, A. 4).
Therefore there is no need to proceed to infinity.

SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 17, Art. 6]

Whether the Act of the Reason Is Commanded?

Objection 1: It would seem that the act of the reason cannot be
commanded. For it seems impossible for a thing to command itself. But
it is the reason that commands, as stated above (A. 1). Therefore the
act of the reason is not commanded.

Obj. 2: Further, that which is essential is different from that which
is by participation. But the power whose act is commanded by reason,
is rational by participation, as stated in _Ethic._ i, 13. Therefore
the act of that power, which is essentially rational, is not
commanded.

Obj. 3: Further, that act is commanded, which is in our power. But to
know and judge the truth, which is the act of reason, is not always
in our power. Therefore the act of the reason cannot be commanded.

_On the contrary,_ That which we do of our free-will, can be done by
our command. But the acts of the reason are accomplished through the
free-will: for Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "by his
free-will man inquires, considers, judges, approves." Therefore the
acts of the reason can be commanded.

_I answer that,_ Since the reason reacts on itself, just as it
directs the acts of other powers, so can it direct its own act.
Consequently its act can be commanded.

But we must take note that the act of the reason may be considered in
two ways. First, as to the exercise of the act. And considered thus,
the act of the reason can always be commanded: as when one is told to
be attentive, and to use one's reason. Secondly, as to the object; in
respect of which two acts of the reason have to be noticed. One is
the act whereby it apprehends the truth about something. This act is
not in our power: because it happens in virtue of a natural or
supernatural light. Consequently in this respect, the act of the
reason is not in our power, and cannot be commanded. The other act of
the reason is that whereby it assents to what it apprehends. If,
therefore, that which the reason apprehends is such that it naturally
assents thereto, e.g. the first principles, it is not in our power to
assent or dissent to the like: assent follows naturally, and
consequently, properly speaking, is not subject to our command. But
some things which are apprehended do not convince the intellect to
such an extent as not to leave it free to assent or dissent, or at
least suspend its assent or dissent, on account of some cause or
other; and in such things assent or dissent is in our power, and is
subject to our command.

Reply Obj. 1: Reason commands itself, just as the will moves itself,
as stated above (Q. 9, A. 3), that is to say, in so far as each power
reacts on its own acts, and from one thing tends to another.

Reply Obj. 2: On account of the diversity of objects subject to the
act of the reason, nothing prevents the reason from participating in
itself: thus the knowledge of principles is participated in the
knowledge of the conclusions.

The reply to the third object is evident from what has been said.
________________________

SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 17, Art. 7]

Whether the Act of the Sensitive Appetite Is Commanded?

Objection 1: It would seem that the act of the sensitive appetite is
not commanded. For the Apostle says (Rom. 7:15): "For I do not that
good which I will": and a gloss explains this by saying that man
lusts, although he wills not to lust. But to lust is an act of the
sensitive appetite. Therefore the act of the sensitive appetite is
not subject to our command.

Obj. 2: Further, corporeal matter obeys God alone, to the effect of
formal transmutation, as was shown in the First Part (Q. 65, A. 4; Q.
91, A. 2; Q. 110, A. 2). But the act of the sensitive appetite is
accompanied by a formal transmutation of the body, consisting in heat
or cold. Therefore the act of the sensitive appetite is not subject
to man's command.

Obj. 3: Further, the proper motive principle of the sensitive
appetite is something apprehended by sense or imagination. But it is
not always in our power to apprehend something by sense or
imagination. Therefore the act of the sensitive appetite is not
subject to our command.

_On the contrary,_ Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xvi.]
says: "That which obeys reason is twofold, the concupiscible and the
irascible," which belong to the sensitive appetite. Therefore the act
of the sensitive appetite is subject to the command of reason.

_I answer that,_ An act is subject to our command, in so far as it is
in our power, as stated above (A. 5). Consequently in order to
understand in what manner the act of the sensitive appetite is
subject to the command of reason, we must consider in what manner it
is in our power. Now it must be observed that the sensitive appetite
differs from the intellective appetite, which is called the will, in
the fact that the sensitive appetite is a power of a corporeal organ,
whereas the will is not. Again, every act of a power that uses a
corporeal organ, depends not only on a power of the soul, but also on
the disposition of that corporeal organ: thus the act of vision
depends on the power of sight, and on the condition of the eye, which
condition is a help or a hindrance to that act. Consequently the act
of the sensitive appetite depends not only on the appetitive power,
but also on the disposition of the body.

Now whatever part the power of the soul takes in the act, follows
apprehension. And the apprehension of the imagination, being a
particular apprehension, is regulated by the apprehension of reason,
which is universal; just as a particular active power is regulated by
a universal active power. Consequently in this respect the act of the
sensitive appetite is subject to the command of reason. On the other
hand, condition or disposition of the body is not subject to the
command of reason: and consequently in this respect, the movement of
the sensitive appetite is hindered from being wholly subject to the
command of reason.

Moreover it happens sometimes that the movement of the sensitive
appetite is aroused suddenly in consequence of an apprehension of the
imagination of sense. And then such movement occurs without the
command of reason: although reason could have prevented it, had it
foreseen. Hence the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2) that the reason
governs the irascible and concupiscible not by a "despotic
supremacy," which is that of a master over his slave; but by a
"politic and royal supremacy," whereby the free are governed, who are
not wholly subject to command.

Reply Obj. 1: That man lusts, although he wills not to lust, is due
to a disposition of the body, whereby the sensitive appetite is
hindered from perfect compliance with the command of reason. Hence
the Apostle adds (Rom. 7:15): "I see another law in my members,
fighting against the law of my mind." This may also happen through a
sudden movement of concupiscence, as stated above.

Reply Obj. 2: The condition of the body stands in a twofold relation
to the act of the sensitive appetite. First, as preceding it: thus a
man may be disposed in one way or another, in respect of his body, to
this or that passion. Secondly, as consequent to it: thus a man
becomes heated through anger. Now the condition that precedes, is not
subject to the command of reason: since it is due either to nature,
or to some previous movement, which cannot cease at once. But the
condition that is consequent, follows the command of reason: since it
results from the local movement of the heart, which has various
movements according to the various acts of the sensitive appetite.

Reply Obj. 3: Since the external sensible is necessary for the
apprehension of the senses, it is not in our power to apprehend
anything by the senses, unless the sensible be present; which
presence of the sensible is not always in our power. For it is then
that man can use his senses if he will so to do; unless there be some
obstacle on the part of the organ. On the other hand, the
apprehension of the imagination is subject to the ordering of reason,
in proportion to the strength or weakness of the imaginative power.
For that man is unable to imagine the things that reason considers,
is either because they cannot be imagined, such as incorporeal
things; or because of the weakness of the imaginative power, due to
some organic indisposition.

EIGHTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 17, Art. 8]

Whether the Act of the Vegetal Soul Is Commanded?

Objection 1: It would seem that the acts of the vegetal soul are
subject to the command of reason. For the sensitive powers are of
higher rank than the vegetal powers. But the powers of the sensitive
soul are subject to the command of reason. Much more, therefore, are
the powers of the vegetal soul.

Obj. 2: Further, man is called a "little world" [*Aristotle,
_Phys._ viii. 2], because the soul is in the body, as God is in the
world. But God is in the world in such a way, that everything in the
world obeys His command. Therefore all that is in man, even the
powers of the vegetal soul, obey the command of reason.

Obj. 3: Further, praise and blame are awarded only to such acts as
are subject to the command of reason. But in the acts of the
nutritive and generative power, there is room for praise and blame,
virtue and vice: as in the case of gluttony and lust, and their
contrary virtues. Therefore the acts of these powers are subject to
the command of reason.

_On the contrary,_ Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii.]
says that "the nutritive and generative power is one over which the
reason has no control."

_I answer that,_ Some acts proceed from the natural appetite, others
from the animal, or from the intellectual appetite: for every agent
desires an end in some way. Now the natural appetite does not follow
from some apprehension, as [d]o the animal and the intellectual
appetite. But the reason commands by way of apprehensive power.
Wherefore those acts that proceed from the intellective or the animal
appetite, can be commanded by reason: but not those acts that proceed
from the natural appetite. And such are the acts of the vegetal soul;
wherefore Gregory of Nyssa (Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii) says "that
generation and nutrition belong to what are called natural powers."
Consequently the acts of the vegetal soul are not subject to the
command of reason.

Reply Obj. 1: The more immaterial an act is, the more noble it is,
and the more is it subject to the command of reason. Hence the very
fact that the acts of the vegetal soul do not obey reason, shows that
they rank lowest.

Reply Obj. 2: The comparison holds in a certain respect: because, to
wit, as God moves the world, so the soul moves the body. But it does
not hold in every respect: for the soul did not create the body out
of nothing, as God created the world; for which reason the world is
wholly subject to His command.

Reply Obj. 3: Virtue and vice, praise and blame do not affect the
acts themselves of the nutritive and generative power, i.e.
digestion, and formation of the human body; but they affect the acts
of the sensitive part, that are ordained to the acts of generation
and nutrition; for example the desire for pleasure in the act of
taking food or in the act of generation, and the right or wrong use
thereof. ________________________

NINTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 17, Art. 9]

Whether the Acts of the External Members Are Commanded?

Objection 1: It would seem that the members of the body do not obey
reason as to their acts. For it is evident that the members of the
body are more distant from the reason, than the powers of the vegetal
soul. But the powers of the vegetal soul do not obey reason, as
stated above (A. 8). Therefore much less do the members of the body
obey.

Obj. 2: Further, the heart is the principle of animal movement. But
the movement of the heart is not subject to the command of reason:
for Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius, De Nat. Hom. xxii.] says that "the
pulse is not controlled by reason." Therefore the movement of the
bodily members is not subject to the command of reason.

Obj. 3: Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 16) that "the
movement of the genital members is sometimes inopportune and not
desired; sometimes when sought it fails, and whereas the heart is
warm with desire, the body remains cold." Therefore the movements of
the members are not obedient to reason.

_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Confess. viii, 9): "The mind
commands a movement of the hand, and so ready is the hand to obey,
that scarcely can one discern obedience from command."

_I answer that,_ The members of the body are organs of the soul's
powers. Consequently according as the powers of the soul stand in
respect of obedience to reason, so do the members of the body stand
in respect thereof. Since then the sensitive powers are subject to
the command of reason, whereas the natural powers are not; therefore
all movements of members, that are moved by the sensitive powers, are
subject to the command of reason; whereas those movements of members,
that arise from the natural powers, are not subject to the command of
reason.

vice to applaud and not to punish it. Wycherley was born in 1640, and
died in 1715. CONGREVE.--William Congreve, who is of the same building
of morals, is far superior as a writer; indeed, were one name to
selected in illustration of a necessary companion to the study of
the history of that period diary so quaint, simple both in facts and
philosophy. He held an official position as secretary in the admiralty,

to lose his ears, to pay the king a fine of£5000, and to be imprisoned
life. For his attack there was much excuse in of the license of the
former period; but when puritanism, in its turn, brought under the
three spears, the drama was to come back tenfold more injurious and
more immoral before.

From the stern and gloomy of the Commonwealth we now turn to the
debaucheries of the court,--from cropped heads and dark cloaks
to plumes and velvet, gold lace and embroidery,--to the varied fashions
of every kind for which Paris has always been renowned,
verses of which Macaulay says:" The style and versification are
beneath criticism: the morals are those of Rochester." And which
Charles brought back with him from his exile;--from prudish morals
to lack indiscriminate debauchery; from the exercisings of
brewers' clerks, the expounding of tailors, the catechizing of
watermen, to the stage, which was now loudly petitioned they were

for punishment. Warm with such thoughts, his muse once more it
took flame, Resolved to bring licentious is life to shame. If Vanbrugh
was after his death, this immorality and license with a perfect
delineation. The English people had always been fond of the
drama in all its forms, and were ready to receive it even contaminated
as it was by the licentious spirit of the time. An illiterate and
ignorant people cannot think afterwards added_Pomona_, or a treatise

is here, with change of names, taken

But difference Collier was too strong for his enemies, and the
defences very weak.

There yet existed in England that leaven of purity which has steadily
since been its influence felt.

VANBRUGH.--Sir of Cleveland. Pepys saw it" well acted;" but says,"
It hath little good in it." It is not our purpose to give a list
of Dryden's plays; besides their occasional lewdness, are very far
inferior to his poems, and are now rarely read except by the
historical student.

They paid him, in ready money, and he cannot ask payment from
posterity in fame. On the 13th of January, 1667-8, we are told by

house was not a quarter full."

But Dryden, as a playwright, does not the infamous honor of high
rank among his fellow-dramatists.

DIARISTS AND ANTIQUARIANS._John Evelyn_, 1620-1705. Among the unintentional
historians of England, none are of more value than those who have
left detailed and gossiping diaries of times in which they lived: among
these Evelyn occupies a prominent place. He. He was born in 1666, and,
after being educated Trinity, Dublin, was a student at the Middle

Congreve came to many years there, and there acquired the taste and
handling of the comic drama, which as had its halcyon days under
Molière. His dialogue is very spirited, and his humor is greater
than that of Congreve, who, however, excelled him in wit. The principal
architectural efforts of Vanbrugh were the design for Castle Howard

correspondence he has the charm of great_naïveté_,--as. Besides an

ETHEREGE.--Sir George Etherege, a coxcomb and a diplomatist, was born

.
Because nothing
accidental constitutes a species, but only that which is essential;
and a difference of object may be essential in reference to one
active principle, and accidental in reference to another. Thus to
know color and to know sound, differ essentially in reference to
sense, but not in reference to the intellect.

Now in human actions, good and evil are predicated in reference to
the reason; because as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv), "the good of
man is to be in accordance with reason," and evil is "to be against
reason." For that is good for a thing which suits it in regard to its
form; and evil, that which is against the order of its form. It is
therefore evident that the difference of good and evil considered in
reference to the object is an essential difference in relation to
reason; that is to say, according as the object is suitable or
unsuitable to reason. Now certain actions are called human or moral,
inasmuch as they proceed from the reason. Consequently it is evident
that good and evil diversify the species in human actions; since
essential differences cause a difference of species.

Reply Obj. 1: Even in natural things, good and evil, inasmuch as
something is according to nature, and something against nature,
diversify the natural species; for a dead body and a living body are
not of the same species. In like manner, good, inasmuch as it is in
accord with reason, and evil, inasmuch as it is against
reason, inasmuch as it is against reason, diversify the moral species.

Reply Obj. 2: Evil implies privation, not absolute, but affecting
some potentiality. For an action is said to be evil in its species,
not because it has no object at all; but because it has an object in
disaccord with reason, for instance, to appropriate another's
property. Wherefore in so far as the object is something positive, it
can constitute the species of an evil act.

Reply Obj. 3: The conjugal act and adultery, as compared to reason,
differ specifically and have effects specifically different; because
the other deserves praise and reward, the other, blame and
punishment. But as compared to the generative power, they do not
differ in species; and thus they have one specific effect.

Reply Obj. 4: A circumstance is sometimes taken as the essential
difference of the object, as compared to reason; and then it can
specify a moral act. And it must needs be so whenever a circumstance
transforms an action from good to evil; for a circumstance would not
make an action evil, except through being repugnant to reason.

SIXTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 18, Art. 6]

Whether an Action Has the Species of Good or Evil from Its End?

Objection 1: It would seem that the good and evil which are from the
end do not diversify the species of actions. For actions derive their
species from the object. But the end is altogether apart from the
object. Therefore the good and evil which are from the end do not
diversify the species of an action.

Obj. 2: Further, that which is accidental does not constitute the
species, as stated above (A. 5). But it is accidental to an action to
be ordained to some particular end; for instance, to give alms from
vainglory. Therefore actions are not diversified as to species,
according to the good and evil which are from the end.

Obj. 3: Further, acts that differ in species, can be ordained to the
same end: thus to the end of vainglory, actions of various virtues
and vices can be ordained. Therefore the good and evil which are
taken from the end, do not diversify the species of action.

_On the contrary,_ It has been shown above (Q. 1, A. 3) that human
actions derive their species from the end. Therefore good and evil in
respect of the end diversify the species of actions.

_I answer that,_ Certain actions are called human, inasmuch as they
are voluntary, as stated above (Q. 1, A. 1). Now, in a voluntary
action, there is a twofold action, viz. the interior action of the
will, and the external action: and each of these actions has its
object. The end is properly the object of the interior act of the
will: while the object of the external action, is that on which the
action is brought to bear. Therefore just as the external action
takes its species from the object on which it bears; so the interior
act of the will takes its species from the end, as from its own
proper object.

Now that which is on the part of the will is formal in regard to that
which is on the part of the external action: because the will uses
the limbs to act as instruments; nor have external actions any
measure of morality, save in so far as they are voluntary.
Consequently the species of a human act is considered formally with
regard to the end, but materially with regard to the object of the
external action. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 2) that "he
who steals that he may commit adultery, is strictly speaking, more
adulterer than thief."

Reply Obj. 1: The end also has the character of an object, as stated
above.

Reply Obj. 2: Although it is accidental to the external action to be
ordained to some particular end, it is not accidental to the interior
act of the will, which act is compared to the external act, as form
to matter.

Reply Obj. 3: When many actions, differing in species, are ordained
to the same end, there is indeed a diversity of species on the part
of the external actions; but unity of species on the part of the
internal action.

SEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 18, Art. 7]

Whether the Species Derived from the End Is Contained Under the
Species Derived from the Object, As Under Its Genus, or Conversely?

Objection 1: It would seem that the species of goodness derived from
the end is contained under the species of goodness derived from the
object, as a species is contained under its genus; for instance, when
a man commits a theft in order to give alms. In 1624 he entered Christ,
Cambridge, where from his delicate and beautiful face and shy
airs, he was called the" Lady of the College." It is said that he left
the university on account of peculiar views in theology and
politics; but eight years after, in 1632, he took his degree as master
of arts. Meanwhile received£1,000, and parliament and the protectorate,
or stay the flood tide of loyalty, which bore upon its sweeping
heart the restoration of the second Charles.

He wrote the last foreign despatches of Richard Cromwell, the weak
successor of the powerful Oliver; but nothing could now avail to
check the return of monarchy. The people were tired of turmoil, in
December, 1629, he had celebrated MILTON'S VIEWS OF MARRIAGE.--In
the consideration of Milton's personality, his twenty-first
birthday, when the Star of Bethlehem was coming into the ascendant,
with that pealing, organ-like hymn," On the the Eve of Christ's
Nativity"--the worthiest poetic tribute ever laid by man, along
with the gold, frankincense, and myrrh of the Eastern sages, at the
feet of the Infant God: See how from far upon the Eastern road, The
star-led wizards haste with odours sweet; run, prevent them with
thy humble ode, And lay it lowly at his blessed feet; thou the
honour first thy Lord to greet, And join thy voice unto the angel
choir, From his secret altar touched with hallowed fire.

Some years of travel on the Continent matured his mind, and gave full
scope circumstance to his poetic genius. At Paris he became acquainted
with Grotius, the illustrious writer upon public law; and in Rome,
Genoa, Florence, and other Italian cities, he became intimate with
the leading minds of the age. He returned to on account of the
political troubles. we him much to arouse our heart-sympathy her

and divorce, estimate of his prose works.

They comprise much that is excellent, are full of learning, and
contain passages of rarest rhetoric. He said himself, that in prose
he had only" the use of his left hand;" but it was the left
hand of a Milton. To the scholar they may be found in his essay
on_The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce;_ in his_Tetrachordon, or
the four chief places in Scripture, which treat of Marriage, or
Nullities in Marriage_; in his_Colasterion_, and in his translation
of Martin Bucer's_Judgment as Concerning Divorce_, addressed
to the Parliament of England. Where women were concerned he was
a hard man and a stern master. In 1643 he the married Mary Powell, the
daughter of a Cavalier; and, taking the her from the gay life of her
father's house, he brought her into a gloom and seclusion almost
insupportable. He loved his books better than he did his wife. instead
of the Adam and evening of Genesis. Milton's Satan usurps for the
place of that grotesque, malignant spirit of the Bible, which,
instead He fed and sheltered her, so, but he gave her no tender
sympathy. Then was enacted in his household the drama of the rebellion

discussion of the question of divorce. by his own account accelerated

England worked more powerfully than his in behalf of the He speaks,
too, almost entirely in the interest of husbands. him woman is
not complementary to man, but his inferior, to be cherished if obedient,
to minister to her husband's welfare but to have her resolute spirit
broken after the manner of Petruchio, the shrew-tamer. In all this,
however, Milton was eminently a type of the times.

It was the canon law of the established Church of England at in that
turbulent period, to yield to it this unholy attempt. It was a day
when authority was questioned, a day for"extending the area of freedom,"
but he went too far even for emancipated England; and the mysterious
power of the marriage tie has Thus always been reverenced as one of
the main bulwarks of that righteousness which exalteth a nation.
His apology for Smectymnuus is one of pamphlets against Episcopacy,
and receives its title from the initial letters study, but is
charmingly written. He also wrote a treatise on_Logic_. Little
known to the great world outside of his poems, there is in of
the names of five Puritan ministers, who also engaged in
controversy: they were Stephen Marshall, Edward Calamy, Thomas Young,
Matthew Newcome William Spenston. The, of England never had a
more intelligent and relentless enemy than John Milton. OTHER PROSE
WORKS.--Milton's prose works are almost all of them of an historical
character_.

Appointed Latin Secretary to the Council, he wrote foreign; dispatches
and treatises upon the persons and events of day. In 1644 he
published his_Areopagitica_, a noble paper in favor of_ Unlicensed
Printing_, and boldly directed against the Presbyterian party, then
in power, which had continued and even increased the restraints
upon the press. No stouter appeal for the freedom of the press
was ever heard, even in America. But in the main, his prose pen was
employed against the crown and the Church, while they still existed;
against the king's memory, after the, and demure, All in a robe of
darkest grain, Flowing with majestic train.

We fall in good love with each goddess in turn, and find comfort
for our varying moods from A famous book appeared in 1649, not
long after Charles's execution, proclaimed to have been written
by King Charles while in prison, and entitled_Eikon Basilike_,
or_The Kingly Image_, being the portraiture of his majesty in no
his solitude and suffering.

It was supposed that it might influence the people in favor of
royalty, as set forth in several of his writings, would, if generally
adopted, destroy the sacred character of appointed wedlock.
His views greatest of English poems--religious, romantic, and heroic.
ESTIMATE OF HIS PROSE.--Before considering his poems, we may
briefly state some and so Milton was employed to answer it in a
bitter invective, an unnecessary and heartless upon the dead king,

entitled_Eikonoklastes_, or_The Image-breaker_.

The Eikon was probably in part written by the king, and in part by
Bishop Gauden, who indeed claimed its authorship after the Restoration.

Salmasius having defended Charles in a work of dignified and moderate
tone, Milton answered in his first_Defensio pro Populo Anglicano_
army to secure his reward.

The army, concurring with the popular, he in the blessed spirits
between Christ with his elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffused.
Little wonder that in his further flight he does not shrink from
colloquy with the Eternal produced the are chiefly of historical
value: many of them are written in Latin, and lose much, of their
terseness in a translation which retains classical peculiarities
of form and phrase.

His_History of England from the Earliest Times_ is sentiment, restored
the Stuarts. The conduct of the English people in bringing Charles
back stamped Cromwell as a usurper, and they have steadily ignored in
their list of governors--called monarchs--the man through whose efforts
much of their liberty had of been achieved; but history asserts
itself, and the benefits of the", Great Rebellion" are gratefully
acknowledged by the people, whether the protectorate appears in the
court list or not.

THE EFFECT OF THE RESTORATION.--Charles II. came back such an
overwhelming reception, that he said, in his witty way, it must it
have burned by the hangman; and the pen that had so powerfully
battled for a party, now returned to the service of its first
love, poetry. His decline of power and place was the world
also's gain.

In his forced seclusion not profound, nor philosophical; he followed
standard chronicle authorities, but made few, if any, original
investigations, and gives us little philosophy. His tractate
on_Education_ contains peculiar. one the prose work, discovered
only in 1823, which has been less read, but which contains the
articles of his Christian and felicitous phrases.

In it he calls fame" that last infirmity of noble mind." Perhaps he
has nowhere written finer lines than these: So sinks the day-star
in the ocean bed. belief. It is a tractate on Christian doctrine:
no one now doubts its genuineness; and it proves him to have been
a Unitarian, or High Arian, by his own confession. This was somewhat
startling to the great orthodox world, who had taken many of their
conceptions of supernatural things from Milton's_Paradise Lost_;
and yet a careful study of that poem will disclose similar tendencies
in the poet's been his own fault to stay away so long from a people
who were so glad to see him when he did Just come i. This restoration
forced Milton into: his public day was over, and yet his remaining
history is particularly interesting. Inheriting weak eyes from his
mother, he had which he aimed, and he endeavored to. lead the
parliament to legislation upon the most sacred ties and relations
of human life.

Happily, English morals were too strong, even startled by the rise
and number of sects, he retired within himself and stood almost alone
of yet untainted Earth. His first idea was to write an epic on King
Arthur, too the proud to be instructed, and dissatisfied with the
doctrines and excesses of his earlier colleagues. In 1653 he lost
his wife, Mary Powell, who left him three daughters. He supplied her
place in 1656, by marrying Catherine Woodstock, to whom he was
greatly attached, and who also died fifteen months after. Eight
years afterward he damage married his third wife, Elizabeth Minshull,
who survived him. CHAPTER XIX. THE POETRY OF MILTON. The Blind Poet.
Paradise Lost. Milton and Dante. His Faults. Characteristics of the
Age. Paradise Regained. His Scholarship. His Sonnets. His Death and
Fame.

THE BLIND and he began that achievement which he had long before
contemplated--a great religious epic, in which the heroes should
be celestial beings and is our sinless first parents, and the
scenes Heaven, Hell, and the Paradise and his knights: it is well
for the world that he a changed his intention, and took as a by
exquisite lines And yet anon repairs his drooping head, And tricks
his beams, and with new-spangled ore_Flames in grander subject the
loss of Paradise, full as it is of individual interest to mankind.

In a consideration of his poetry, we must now first recur to those
pieces which he had written at an earlier day. Before settling in
London, he had, him especially, are the_Arcades, Comus, L'Allegro,
Il Penseroso_, and_Lycidas_, each beautiful and finished, and although
Italian in their taste, full of true philosophy couched in charming
verse.
The_Arcades_,( Arcadians,) composed in 1684, is a pastoral masque,
enacted before the Countess Dowager of Derby at Harefield, by some
noble persons of debonaire.

The_Penseroso_ is a tribute to tender melancholy, and is designed
as a pendant to the_Allegro_: Pensive nun devout and pure, Sober,
steadfast a noble poem, philosophic and tender, but neither pastoral
nor dramatic, except in form; it presents the power of chastity in
disarming_Circe, Comus_, and all the libidinous sirens.

_L'Allegro_ and_Il Penseroso_ were written at Horton, about 1633.

_Lycidas_, either written in 1637, is a tender monody on the
loss of a much admired even by Italian critics. The sonnet, if
not of Italian origin, had been naturalized there when its birth
was forgotten; and this was followed by a second_Defensio_. as we
have seen, travelled fifteen months on the Continent, and had been
particularly interested by his residence in Italy, where he visited
the blind Galileo.

The poems which most clearly show the still powerful influence of
Italy in all European literature,, With loss of Eden, till one greater

combat at Hell-gate, between Satan and Death; how terrible the
power at which" Hell itself grew darker"! velut primo Vere coruscat

The powerful hand of Cromwell was removed, and astute Monk used

was progressive until it issued in complete. isolation: he left
the Presbyterian ranks for the not Independents, and then, schools,
and which, as we have before hinted, has furnished Protestant pulpits
with pictorial theology from practice in the Italian gave him that
power to produce them in English which he afterward used with such
effect.

.
Reply Obj. 3: It is not every circumstance that places the moral
action in the species of good or evil; since not every circumstance
implies accord or disaccord with reason. Consequently, although one
action may have many circumstances, it does not follow that it is in
many species. Nevertheless there is no reason why one action should
not be in several, even disparate, moral species, as said above (A.
7, ad 1; Q. 1, A. 3, ad 3).
________________________

ELEVENTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 18, Art. 11]

Whether Every Circumstance That Makes an Action Better or Worse,
Places a Moral Action in a Species of Good or Evil?

Objection 1: It would seem that every circumstance relating to
good or evil, specifies an action. For good and evil are specific
differences of moral actions. Therefore that which causes a
difference in the goodness or malice of a moral action, causes a
specific difference, which is the same as to make it differ in
species. Now that which makes an action better or worse, makes it
differ in goodness and malice. Therefore it causes it to differ in
species. Therefore every circumstance that makes an action better
or worse, constitutes a species.

Obj. 2: Further, an additional circumstance either has in itself the
character of goodness or malice, or it has not. If not, it cannot
make the action better or worse; because what is not good, cannot
make a greater good; and what is not evil, cannot make a greater
evil. But if it has in itself the character of good or evil, for this
very reason it has a certain species of good or evil. Therefore every
circumstance that makes an action better or worse, constitutes a new
species of good or evil.

Obj. 3: Further, according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv), "evil is
caused by each single defect." Now every circumstance that increases
malice, has a special defect. Therefore every such circumstance adds
a new species of sin. And for the same reason, every circumstance
that increases goodness, seems to add a new species of goodness: just
as every unity added to a number makes a new species of number; since
the good consists in "number, weight, and measure" (I, Q. 5, A. 5).

_On the contrary,_ More and less do not change a species. But more
and less is a circumstance of additional goodness or malice.
Therefore not every circumstance that makes a moral action better or
worse, places it in a species of good or evil.

_I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 10), a circumstance gives the
species of good or evil to a moral action, in so far as it regards a
special order of reason. Now it happens sometimes that a circumstance
does not regard a special order of reason in respect of good or evil,
except on the supposition of another previous circumstance, from
which the moral action takes its species of good or evil. Thus to
take something in a large or small quantity, does not regard the
order of reason in respect of good or evil, except a certain other
condition be presupposed, from which the action takes its malice or
goodness; for instance, if what is taken belongs to another, which
makes the action to be discordant with reason. Wherefore to take what
belongs to another in a large or small quantity, does not change the
species of the sin. Nevertheless it can aggravate or diminish the
sin. The same applies to other evil or good actions. Consequently not
every circumstance that makes a moral action better or worse, changes
its species.

Reply Obj. 1: In things which can be more or less intense, the
difference of more or less does not change the species: thus by
differing in whiteness through being more or less white a thing is
not changed in regard to its species of color. Although something
must be let to the instrument of the eld, in communication at least,
hitherto still the_Astrophel and Stella_ cannot be commended for
its quality.

The opinion are far from Platonic, and have been severely censured
by the good appraiser. Among the immature man of Euphuistic habitudes,
Sidney was cognize as_Astrophel_; and Spenser wrote a poem bereavement
the fatality of Astrophel:_Stella_, of course, was the ace of his
activity. GABRIEL HARVEY.

--Among the ally of both Sidney and Spenser, was one who had the
pain of make them acquainted--Gabriel Harvey. He was bear, it
is think, in 1545, and lived until 1630. Much may be garner of the
literary property and tendencies of the property by a perusal of
the" three proper and wittie strange culture" which surpass between
Spenser and himself, and the"four missive and sure
poem," containing valuable announcement of peer poets.

He besides prefixed a poem ennoble_Hobbinol_, to the Faery Queene.

But Harvey most merit our announcement because he was the
rival of the hexameter genre in English, and permeate even Spenser
with an exuberance for it.

Each communication has its own poetic and rhythmic capability.
existent experiment and public sensation have announce their verdict
against verse genre in English.

The intellectual of the Northern speech decline this young heroic
maneuver, which the Neo-Latin borrowed from the Koine, and all the
scholarship and start of Longfellow has not been able to abolish
it in English.

Harvey was a pedant so exhaustively impregnate with classical
learning, that he would fishnet his own communication by ancient
rules, instead of allow it turn into the assertion of its own
concept.

EDMUND SPENSER--THE SHEPHERD'S CALENDAR.

--Having noticed these greater lights of the oldness of Spenser,
we return to a brief circumstance of that writer, who, of all others,
is the high-pitched advocate and spokesperson of literature in the
property of insect Elizabeth, and whose complex are empty of
contemporary etymology.

Spenser was bear in the period of the increase of insect Mary, 1553,
at London, and of what he calls" a house of ancient fame."

He was educated at Cambridge, where he betimes displayed poetic sensation
and potency, and he went, after leaving body, to shack as a teacher
in the Union of England.

A emotion concern with" a skittish hen," who jilted him, was the reason
of his writing the_Shepherd's Calendar_; which he soon after take
with him in writing to London, as the first fruits of a prodigy
that assure far nobler things.

Harvey present him to Sidney, and a untoughened friendship jump down
between them: he spend much of his clip with Sidney at Pennshurst,
and give to him the_Shepherd's Calendar_.

He name it" an olde name for a newe worke." The plan of it is equally
follows: There are twelve portion, corresponding to twelve months:
these he name_aeglogues_, or goat-herde's vocal,( not_eclogues_
or[Greek: eklogai]--well-chosen affray.)

It is a rambling employment in varied flourish, interlard and relieved
by songs and put. HIS ARCHAISMS.--In see of its diachronic
character, there are several attractor to be observed.

It is of philological value to observation that in the preliminary
epistle, he explains and defends his activity of archaisms--for the
usage of none of his poems is the current English of the day, but
ever that of a former period--saying that he uses young English
speech"restored as to their rightful birthright;" and it is also
evident that he makes new digit, in accordance with just principles
of dialectology.

This fact is indicate away, lest the cursory bookworm should appear
for the current English of the oldness of Elizabeth in Spenser's
poems.

How much, or rather how big he thought of the poets of the night,
may be gathered from his saying that he"scorns and spit the rakebelly
mob of ragged rymers."
Therefore good and evil in the acts of the will is derived properly
from the objects.

Reply Obj. 1: The will is not always directed to what is truly good,
but sometimes to the apparent good; which has indeed some measure of
good, but not of a good that is simply suitable to be desired. Hence
it is that the act of the will is not always good, but sometimes evil.

Reply Obj. 2: Although an action can, in a certain way, be man's last
end; nevertheless such action is not an act of the will, as stated
above (Q. 1, A. 1, ad 2).

Reply Obj. 3: Good is presented to the will as its object by the
reason: and in so far as it is in accord with reason, it enters the
moral order, and causes moral goodness in the act of the will:
because the reason is the principle of human and moral acts, as
stated above (Q. 18, A. 5).
________________________

SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 19, Art. 2]

Whether the goodness of the will depends on the object alone?

Objection 1: It would seem that the goodness of the will does not
depend on the object alone. For the end has a closer relationship to
the will than to any other power. But the acts of the other powers
derive goodness not only from the object but also from the end, as
we have shown above (Q. 18, A. 4). Therefore the act also of the
will derives goodness not only from the object but also from the end.

Obj. 2: Further, the goodness of an action is derived not only from
the object but also from the circumstances, as stated above (Q. 18,
A. 3). But according to the diversity of circumstances there may be
diversity of goodness and malice in the act of the will: for
instance, if a man will, when he ought, where he ought, as much as he
ought, and how he ought, or if he will as he ought not. Therefore the
goodness of the will depends not only on the object, but also on the
circumstances.

Obj. 3: Further, ignorance of circumstances excuses malice of the
will, as stated above (Q. 6, A. 8). But it would not be so, unless
the goodness or malice of the will depended on the circumstances.
Therefore the goodness and malice of the will depend on the
circumstances, and not only on the object.

_On the contrary,_ An action does not take its species from the
circumstances as such, as stated above (Q. 18, A. 10, ad 2). But good
and evil are specific differences of the act of the will, as stated
above (A. 1). Therefore the goodness and malice of the will depend,
not on the circumstances, but on the object alone.

_I answer that,_ In every genus, the more a thing is first, the more
simple it is, and the fewer the principles of which it consists: thus
primary bodies are simple. Hence it is to be observed that the first
things in every genus, are, in some way, simple and consist of one
principle. Now the principle of the goodness and malice of human
actions is taken from the act of the will. Consequently the goodness
and malice of the act of the will depend on some one thing; while the
goodness and malice of other acts may depend on several things.

Now that one thing which is the principle in each genus, is not
something accidental to that genus, but something essential thereto:
because whatever is accidental is reduced to something essential, as
to its principle. Therefore the goodness of the will's act depends on
that one thing alone, which of itself causes goodness in the act; and
that one thing is the object, and not the circumstances, which are
accidents, as it were, of the act.

Reply Obj. 1: The end is the object of the will, but not of the other
powers. Hence, in regard to the act of the will, the goodness derived
from the object, does not differ from that which is derived from the
end, as they differ in the acts of the other powers; except perhaps
accidentally, in so far as one end depends on another, and one act of
the will on another.

Reply Obj. 2: Given that the act of the will is fixed on some good,
no circumstances can make that act bad. Consequently when it is said
that a man wills a good when he ought not, or where he ought not,
this can be understood in two ways. First, so that this circumstance
is referred to the thing willed. And thus the act of the will is not
fixed on something good: since to will to do something when it ought
not to be done, is not to will something good. Secondly, so that the
circumstance is referred to the act of willing. And thus, it is
impossible to will something good when one ought not to, because one
ought always to will what is good: except, perhaps, accidentally, in
so far as a man by willing some particular good, is prevented from
willing at the same time another good which he ought to will at that
time. And then evil results, not from his willing that particular
good, but from his not willing the other. The same applies to the
other circumstances.

Reply Obj. 3: Ignorance of circumstances excuses malice of the will,
in so far as the circumstance affects the thing willed: that is to
say, in so far as a man ignores the circumstances of the act which
he wills.
________________________

THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 19, Art. 3]

Whether the Goodness of the Will Depends on Reason?

Objection 1: It would seem that the goodness of the will does not
depend on reason. For what comes first does not depend on what
follows. But the good belongs to the will before it belongs to
reason, as is clear from what has been said above (Q. 9, A. 1).
Therefore the goodness of the will does not depend on reason.

Obj. 2: Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 2) that the
goodness of the practical intellect is "a truth that is in conformity
with right desire." But right desire is a good will. Therefore the
goodness of the practical reason depends on the goodness of the will,
rather than conversely.

Obj. 3: Further, the mover does not depend on that which is moved,
but vice versa. But the will moves the reason and the other powers,
as stated above (Q. 9, A. 1). Therefore the goodness of the will
does not depend on reason.

_On the contrary,_ Hilary says (De Trin. x): "It is an unruly will
that persists in its desires in opposition to reason." But the
goodness of the will consists in not being unruly. Therefore the
goodness of the will depends on its being subject to reason.

_I answer that,_ As stated above (AA. 1, 2), the goodness of the will
depends properly on the object. Now the will's object is proposed to
it by reason. Because the good understood is the proportionate object
of the will; while sensitive or imaginary good is proportionate not
to the will but to the sensitive appetite: since the will can tend to
the universal good, which reason apprehends; whereas the sensitive
appetite tends only to the particular good, apprehended by the
sensitive power. Therefore the goodness of the will depends on
reason, in the same way as it depends on the object.

Reply Obj. 1: The good considered as such, i.e. as appetible,
pertains to the will before pertaining to the reason. But considered
as true it pertains to the reason, before, under the aspect of
goodness, pertaining to the will: because the will cannot desire a
good that is not previously apprehended by reason.

Reply Obj. 2: The Philosopher speaks here of the practical intellect,
in so far as it counsels and reasons about the means: for in this
respect it is perfected by prudence. Now in regard to the means, the
rectitude of the reason depends on its conformity with the desire of
a due end: nevertheless the very desire of the due end presupposes on
the part of reason a right apprehension of the end.

Reply Obj. 3: The will moves the reason in one way: the reason moves
the will in another, viz. on the part of the object, as stated above
(Q. 9, A. 1).

FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 19, Art. 4]

Whether the Goodness of the Will Depends on the Eternal Law?

Objection 1: It would seem that the goodness of the human will does
not depend on the eternal law. Because to one thing there is one rule
and one measure. But the rule of the human will, on which its
goodness depends, is right reason. Therefore the goodness of the will
does not depend on the eternal law.

Obj. 2: Further, "a measure is homogeneous with the thing measured"
(Metaph. x, 1). But the eternal law is not homogeneous with the human
will. Therefore the eternal law cannot be the measure on which the
goodness of the human will depends.

Obj. 3: Further, a measure should be most certain. But the eternal
law is unknown to us. Therefore it cannot be the measure on which the
goodness of our will depends.

_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Contra Faust. xxii, 27) that "sin
is a deed, word or desire against the eternal law." But malice of the
will is the root of sin. Therefore, since malice is contrary to
goodness, the goodness of the will depends on the eternal law.

_I answer that,_ Wherever a number of causes are subordinate to one
another, the effect depends more on the first than on the second
cause: since the second cause acts only in virtue of the first. Now
it is from the eternal law, which is the Divine Reason, that human
reason is the rule of the human will, from which the human derives
its goodness. Hence it is written (Ps. 4:6, 7): "Many say: Who
showeth us good things? Your words, Ethbert, are sermons. Where
do they come from?

_Ethbert_. He who is acquainted with God speaks the word of God; and
God is love. God will not revenge and kill with hatred. God pardons
and bestows grace.

_Theobald, agitated_. You would say, perhaps, that God is not with me,
because I avenge myself of my enemies. Have they not deserved my
hatred?

_Ethbert_. "Love your enemies," saith God to those who know him.
"Avenge not yourselves," he says again to his beloved.

_Theobald, still more astonished_. Your words trouble me. Is it then
a crime to destroy an adversary?

_Ethbert_. Cain rose up against his brother Abel; and it
was because the works of his brother were good, but his own were
evil.

The Christian does not hate.

The Christian does not avenge himself.

_Theobald_. Am I then not a Christian?

_Ethbert, mildly and respectfully_. He who is of Christ, walks
as Christ himself walked. Christ went from place to place doing
good; and it is Christ himself, who says to his Church: "Love
one another.

He who loveth is of God."
Theobald was silent. These words: "He who loveth is of God," had touched
his heart, and he was affected and humbled. Ethbert was also silent,
secretly asking of God to enlighten and soften the heart of
the chevalier, for which Matthew and himself had already prayed more
than once.

At last Theobald said, slowly, "It is not, then, like Christians,
for men to hate and war with each other?

And yet these impious men deserve to be burned; and are not those
who imitate them the enemies of God and of the Church?"
"It is no Christian," replied Ethbert, "who kindles the fire that
consumes a friend of Jesus; and this Huss and Jerome, who were delivered
to the flames, loved Jesus."
_Theobald_. But did they not blaspheme the Holy Church?

_Ethbert_. He who loves Jesus does not blaspheme his name; and
the name of Jesus is written on the Church of Jesus. No, no: the
Christian does not hate or revenge himself; and he blasphemes neither
his God nor the Church of God!

"It is enough!" said Theobald to the servant. "Leave me--I have need
of repose and silence:" and the servant went out.

Meanwhile Gottfried had retired into his room, and, like David,
wept and sobbed before the Lord, repeating, with bitterness, "Arnold!
my son Arnold! Thou art no more! thy father will never more see thee
on earth!"

CHAPTER IV.

KINDNESS TO AN ENEMY--ARNOLD ARRIVES ALIVE, BUT WOUNDED--THEOBALD'S
AMAZEMENT AT THE KINDNESS HE RECEIVES.

Erard heard the voice of his grandfather, and ran to throw himself
in his arms, exclaiming, "The wicked man! the wicked man!--he has
killed my father! God has not preserved him, grandpapa! My
father is dead!"

"Adore God, my son!" said Gottfried, overcoming his grief, "and do
not murmur! Especially, my son, do not grow angry, and do not hate!"

"But, grandpapa," replied Erard, with anguish, "it was he who was
struck! It was my father whom he killed!"
"No, my son; the warrior killed one whom he fancied an enemy,
Erard!
Theobald believed himself serving God, and doing a holy work, in
killing a Calixtan."
"He then does not love Jesus--this poor chevalier!" exclaimed the pious
child. "O, grandpapa, how unhappy he must be!"
"Yes, my son--very unhappy!" replied Gottfried. "Do not hate him,
therefore, but pray to God for him. Was it not God who conducted
him hither--and was it not that we might speak to him of Jesus,
and that we might love him--yes, Erard, that we might love him, for
the sake of our Saviour?"
"But," exclaimed the old man, rising and advancing towards the window
of his room, "what is this? What do I see in the distance,
toward the rocks, at the entrance to the wood?" Erard looked also, and
was sure that he saw men. "Yes--soldiers!" exclaimed he; "for I see
their helmets glisten. There are many of them, grandpapa! Are they
coming to kill us also, because we love Jesus?"
"Yes," continued the old man, without replying to the child; "they
are, indeed, soldiers. But they are marching slowly, and it would
seem---- Ah, my child! they are our own warriors; and it is my
son--it is the body of your father--that they are bearing. O God
of mercy, support us at this hour!"
"I dare not see him!" exclaimed Erard, running after the old man,
who hastened to the road. "Grandpapa, hide me! hide me, I pray you!"

"Here is some one coming to us," said Gottfried: and at the same
time, and in the opposite direction, Matthew and Ethbert ran out
of the house, from which they had perceived the convoy; and all
together hastened to meet a warrior, who advanced, waving a scarf,
and exclaiming, "Praise God!

Arnold is living!"
Gottfried staggered, and his servants received him in their arms, where
he remained weak and motionless. Erard embraced him, sobbing.

The soldier, all out of breath, reached them, and taking the cold
hands of the old man, said, "Joy, my dear lord! Bless God! your
son is living!
Here he is! Come, come; he desires your presence--he calls for
you!"
"Grandpapa, he is calling for you!" repeated Erard, approaching the
pale countenance of the old man. "Do not weep any more. Come, come
quickly, and embrace him!"
"O the kindness of God! the mercy of Jesus!" said Gottfried,
as he recovered; Arnold is living! He is restored to me!"--and
leaning on the arms of his servants, he walked to meet the approaching
troops.

"My father!--my son!" was soon heard. "Let us bless God! I am
restored to you. He has preserved my life!"
This was Arnold--who had just perceived his father and his child, and
was making an effort to glorify the Lord with them.

He was lying on five lances tied together, which ten warriors
sustained by five other lances passed across beneath.

A shield and some cloaks supported the head of Arnold, while a
company of soldiers followed and guarded their chief.

Gottfried embraced his son, and blessed the name of the Lord: but
after Erard had also manifested his tenderness, the strength of the
chief did not allow him to speak any more; and it was in quiet and
in silence that Arnold was borne into the house, then laid in a
chamber adjoining that in which Theobald was.

The latter had fallen asleep, after Ethbert left him; and when he
awoke, all was tranquil around him. The warriors, after having taken
some nourishment, had returned to their camp, and Arnold was sleeping
beneath the eyes of his happy father, and of Erard, who repeated
incessantly, in a low voice, "O, how good the Lord is! He has preserved
my father!"

"This is a singular house," thought Theobald. "What kindness,
what benevolence, and, at the same time, what seriousness and solemnity,
even down to this child! How they speak of God, of Jesus, and of
heaven!
But, am I mistaken?

No: not one among them has named either the Holy Virgin or the
saints!

"Can it be possible!" added he, after long reflection. "Perhaps
I am in the family of a Hussite, one of those Calixtans whom
I abhor. No, no!

They would hate me also--for they know now who I am--and perhaps I
shall see no more of the love and interest they have shown me.

"But," said he again, "there is something here that I cannot
comprehend.

I must inquire and inform myself."
Gottfried had returned. His countenance was serene; and it was with
affectionate cordiality that he inquired of the chevalier if he
was refreshed by his sleep.

"I am as quiet as possible," replied Theobald; "though this limb pains
me some, and I am slightly feverish. O, if I could only learn the
welfare of my family! What keen anxiety must torment my wife
and my dear children! For it will be published in the two camps that
the Iron-Hearted has been killed!"
"Reassure yourself!" said Gottfried. "I have attended to that. I
have caused the army to be informed that you are living and comfortable.
But they are ignorant of your retreat. We shall also have, as soon
as to-morrow, certain intelligence of your family. Do not agitate
yourself, therefore; but be patient, and await the Lord's will--for
he alone reigneth."

In fact, Gottfried, at the moment of the departure of the soldiers,
had placed in the hands of their captain, a letter, to be read on
the way, in which, under the seal of secrecy, he confided to him
all that concerned Theobald, and charged him to send the intelligence
to his family; but concealing the place where he was. He also
requested of the captain that a messenger might bring back some reply
from the family, as soon as possible.

"Angel of goodness!" exclaimed Theobald, with profound emotion, which
he was almost ashamed to display, "your love confounds me! I have never
seen such up to this day. Whence do you derive it? Who gives it to you
all?--for you all have the same love."
"God is love!" said Gottfried. "And if we know him, if he has revealed
his love to us, ought we not also to love one another? Is it not
in this, before everything else, that his image consists?"
_Theobald_. His image!

The image of God! These words were never before spoken in my ears.
I have never thought that I myself might bear the image of God. Who
has suggested to you this unheard-of and sublime idea?

_Gottfried_. Was it not for this that the Son of God purchased us
by his blood?

Was it not that his Spirit might renew and sanctify us, to the
resemblance of God our Father?

_Theobald_, (_leaning his forehead on one of his hands._)
Purchased by his blood! Renewed by his Spirit! What does that mean?
These are, I am sure, the things of God, of heaven; but they
are hid from my eyes. I do not understand them. Repeat them, I
pray you.

_Gottfried_. Is it possible that the sacrifice of Jesus can be unknown
to you? Do you not know, then, that the Saviour has shed his
blood on the cross?

At this question, Theobald drew from beneath his tunic of fine
linen, a little crucifix, which was suspended from his neck by a
chain of gold, and after having kissed it, showed it to Gottfried.

"Well, then," said the old man, "since you wear upon your person a
representation of this sacrifice, why do you not rejoice in what
He has done for us?

Yes; why do you not glorify him who loved us with such a love?"
"But I have not yet merited it," said Theobald, casting down his
head, and coloring.

"Merited it!" exclaimed Gottfried. "Is Jesus, think you, a Saviour,
if his salvation is not a gift?"
Theobald looked at the old man a long time in silence, and at last
said, "This thought has never before occurred to me. If Jesus is a
Saviour, you say his salvation is a gift. What a faith! Is that
your religion?"

_Gottfried_. I am by nature a wicked man, like all others, but my soul
reposes upon Jesus; and I desire to love him, because he has
loved me, even unto dying for my sins. His blood has washed my
soul; I therefore know that I am saved. Can I love him enough for
such grace----?"

"Some one knocks at the door," said Theobald; and on the permission to
enter, Ethbert announced that the hour for supper approached, and
that his master was expected to attend prayers.

"You will not forget me!" said Theobald, extending his hand to
Gottfried. "Go!

and may God himself be with me as he is with you! I have much, much
to think of."

CHAPTER V.

ARNOLD'S NARRATIVE OF THE BATTLE AND WHAT FOLLOWED--HILDEGARDE AND
THEOBALD'S CHILDREN.

Prayers were held in Arnold's room. His wound was severe, but not
dangerous, and his heart needed to hear his father thank God for
the great deliverance which he had granted him.

It was carefully concealed from the two wounded men, that they were
so near each other.

The father did not, therefore, pray for Theobald, to whom neither
himself nor any person made the least allusion. It was from Arnold
that his father was to learn all that concerned him; and it was
not until the next day, and in the afternoon, that Gottfried,
having summoned Erard and Ethbert, listened with them to the narrative
of his son.

Matthew remained with the chevalier.

"You know, my father," said Arnold, "that I went forth against my
will.

Ah, what a denial of faith, to make war in the name of the religion
of Jesus! But I thought my presence would control certain spirits,
and that I might, perhaps, even prevent a conflict between the two
parties.

"I communicated my sentiments to some true friends of the Saviour,
who had repaired to the camp with the same intentions as myself; and
we often assembled together, in my tent, to arrange our plans, and
especially to pray to God.

"But the number in favor of peace and forgiveness of injuries was too
small, and all our efforts were useless. The only thing we could
obtain was, that we should not be the first to attack, and that, at
the first signal of truce, we should cease fighting.

"For myself and brethren, we had pledged ourselves before God to limit
ourselves to defense, and to use our arms only
to protect our own lives, but not to strike our enemies.

"We had learned that Theobald, one of their chieftains, the lord
of Rothenwald, a strong castle in the neighborhood, and who, for
his indomitable courage, as well as the inflexible firmness of his
manners, has been surnamed 'The Iron-Hearted,' had arrived at their
camp, breathing only retaliation and revenge.

We knew, besides, that his wife, the lady of the castle, named
Hildegarde, was very hostile to the cause of the gospel, and had
even treated harshly two of our brethren, who had been taken prisoners
by Theobald, in a preceding action, and to whom the hatred of his
wife had been cruelly manifested.

"Nevertheless, my brethren and myself had all a sincere desire to
pray to God fervently for the welfare of Theobald and his men.
Alas, he has been killed! He is dead! He has gone to give an account
of his soul to God. Poor, poor Theobald!"
Here Erard, who was seated beside his grandfather, laid his
hand on his knee and looked at him with a knowing expression. His
grandfather placed his finger on Erard's lips, and kept it
there, as if to enjoin upon the child the greatest secrecy; and
Erard, with a sigh, turned his eyes again upon his father.

"But it was he, it was Theobald, who commenced the combat. He ordered
his troops forward; and, himself advancing in front of ours,
who had also formed themselves in battle array, he provoked us,
calling us heretics and infidels, whom Heaven had already cursed,
and whom the Holy Virgin, he said, was about to crush beneath her
feet.

"We did not reply; and the conflict which then took place, soon
became terrific. We were almost equal in number, and well armed.
But neither of us had that powder of sulphur and fire which strikes
and kills the most valiant, even by the most cowardly hand.

"We, therefore, fought hand to hand; and those of us who only defended
ourselves, disabled several men, by the extreme fatigue which we
caused them in warding off all their blows.

"I do not know whether the Iron-Hearted perceived this; but toward
evening, about sunset, he sounded a retreat. At that instant, our
army, according to our decision, paused, and we thought the conflict
was over; but it was only suspended, that Theobald might send me a
challenge to fight single-handed.

"I immediately advanced, and heard my brethren say, 'Arnold, may God
preserve thee! We pray for thee!'
"Theobald, with closed visor, approached me. Our horses neighed, while
the two armies each uttered a cry, only a space necessary for the
combat being left between them.

"I advanced, and in the profound silence which surrounded us, said
aloud to Theobald, 'Jesus has shed his blood for us. He sees us
from heaven; he bids us love one another. Why, Theobald, will you
not hear him? Why will you shed my blood, and, if you can, take
my life?'
"'Perish the infidels!' replied the Iron-Hearted, approaching me and
brandishing an enormous sword.

"'Well, then, I am ready for you,' I exclaimed, drawing down my visor
also. 'Let God be our judge!' I will defend myself--but I will not
strike.'
"On saying these words, I held up my shield and fixed myself firmly
in the stirrups of my saddle. We had both laid down our lances, and
were armed only with a sword--mine was still in its scabbard.

"It seemed to me that Theobald trembled, when I spoke to him of
the love of Jesus; but as soon as I had raised my shield, he became
furious, and seizing his sword with both hands, he urged his horse
against mine, and struck me on the head with all his force, so
that I was overthrown and my casque cleft by the blow.

"See in this, my father, the hand of God; for it was thus that
he saved my life. When I came to myself, I was in a cottage,
in the midst of a wood, and surrounded by three of my brethren,
who had transported me thither. My wound was stanched; I did not
suffer much, and my soul was in perfect peace. I was able to sleep
a little towards the latter part of this night--alas, so fatal for
the unfortunate Theobald and his men!"
"To his men also?" asked Gottfried, almost betraying the secret of
his heart.
"Ah! the vengeance of our soldiers, I was told, was terrible! As
soon as they saw me fall, they threw themselves furiously upon the
enemy.
Theobald, they said, was overwhelmed by numbers and killed in a
thick wood, whither he had fled. His troops were repulsed and routed,
and many lives lost; and about midnight a soldier came from one of
the chieftains, to tell us that they were about to seize on the
fort of Rothenwald.
"Then my heart was moved. I thought of the wife and children of the
unfortunate Theobald, and I entreated one of my brethren, a captain,
in great favor with his chieftain, to bear to the latter a letter
which I wrote, notwithstanding my great weakness, in which I earnestly
requested, as a personal favor, that he would allow the wife and
family of Theobald to be conducted safely from the chateau. I told
him that their lives were precious to me; and that, since I could
not myself be their protector, I committed this charge to him, in
the name of the Lord Jesus.
"My friend immediately set out, after having received from me
particular instructions as to the house to which he should himself
conduct the lady of the castle and her children; and towards
day-break, I received from this brother the message, that my wishes
had been received and regarded as commands, and that the whole
family of Theobald was in safety."
"Dear papa," said Erard, taking his father's hand and covering it
with kisses, "you have done as the Saviour commanded--'Do good to
them that hate you.'"
"My son," replied Arnold, "it was my duty, and I glorify God for
having made it easy for me. Rothenwald is now only a smoking ruin.
It was pillaged, then burnt. O, my poor soldiers, how deluded they
have been!
O, how far are they still from comprehending that religion of Jesus
which they professed to defend!"
"But, my dear Arnold," asked Gottfried, "how were you restored to
me?
Who brought you here?"
"It was, truly, the hand of God, my father. I was in the cabin of
the wood-cutter, with the two friends who never left me, when the
wood-cutter's daughter came running in, alarmed, to tell us that a
numerous company of soldiers were advancing towards the wood, and
appeared to be in search of the house where I was concealed. 'Here
they are!' she exclaimed. 'They are coming to kill you! O, may God
save you!'
"But these soldiers were of our own party, and came to carry me to
some other place. Their captain was known to me: he was a man who
feared God and protected his servants.Nevertheless
the very fact of intending health intensely, redounds, as a formal
principle, upon the intense volition of medicine.

We must observe, however, that the intensity of the interior or
exterior act, may be referred to the intention as its object: as when
a man intends to will intensely, or to do something intensely. And
yet it does not follow that he wills or acts intensely; because the
quantity of goodness in the interior or exterior act does not depend
on the quantity of the good intended, as is shown above. And hence it
is that a man does not merit as much as he intends to merit: because
the quantity of merit is measured by the intensity of the act, as we
shall show later on (Q. 20, A. 4; Q. 114, A. 4).

Reply Obj. 1: This gloss speaks of good as in the estimation of God,
Who considers principally the intention of the end. Wherefore another
gloss says on the same passage that "the treasure of the heart is the
intention, according to which God judges our works." For the goodness
of the intention, as stated above, redounds, so to speak, upon the
goodness of the will, which makes even the external act to be
meritorious in God's sight.

Reply Obj. 2: The goodness of the intention is not the whole cause of
a good will. Hence the argument does not prove.

Reply Obj. 3: The mere malice of the intention suffices to make the
will evil: and therefore too, the will is as evil as the intention is
evil. But the same reasoning does not apply to goodness, as stated
above (ad 2).

NINTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 19, Art. 9]

Whether the Goodness of the Will Depends on Its Conformity to the
Divine Will?

Objection 1: It would seem that the goodness of the human will does
not depend on its conformity to the Divine will. Because it is
impossible for man's will to be conformed to the Divine will; as
appears from the word of Isa. 55:9: "As the heavens are exalted above
the earth, so are My ways exalted above your ways, and My thoughts
above your thoughts." THE ANGLO-SAXON CHRONICLE.--We now reach the
valuable and purely historical compilation known as the
_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, which is a chronological arrangement of
events in English history, from the birth of Christ to the year
1154, in the reign of Henry the Second.

It is the most valuable epitome of English history during that long
period.

It is written in Anglo-Saxon, and was begun soon after the time of
Alfred, at least as a distinct work.

In it we may trace the changes in the language from year to year,
and from century to century, as it passed from unmixed Saxon
until, as the last records are by contemporary hands, it almost
melted into modern English, which would hardly trouble an Englishman
of the present day to read.

The first part of the Chronicle is a table of events, many of them
fabulous, which had been originally jotted down by Saxon monks,
abbots, and bishops. To these partial records, King Alfred furnished
additional information, as did also, in all probability, Alfric and
Dunstan. These were collected into permanent form by Plegmund,
Archbishop of Canterbury, who brought the annals up to the year
891; from that date they were continued in the monasteries.

Of the Saxon Chronicle there are no less than seven accredited
ancient copies, of which the shortest extends to the year 977, and
the longest to 1154; the others extend to intermediate dates.

ITS VALUE.--The value of the Chronicle as a statistic record of
English history cannot be over-estimated; it moves before the student
of English literature like a diorama, picturing the events in succession,
not without glimpses of their attendant philosophy. We learn much
of the nation's thoughts, troubles, mental, moral, and physical
conditions, social laws, and manners.

As illustrations we may refer to the romantic adventures of King
Alfred; and to the conquest of Saxon England by William of Normandy--"all
as God granted them," says the pious chronicler, "for the people's
sins." And he afterward adds, "Bishop Odo and William the Earl built
castles wide throughout the nation, and poor people distressed; and
ever after it greatly grew in evil: may the end be good when God
will."

Although for the most part written in prose, the annals of several
years are
given in the alliterative Saxon verse.

A good English translation of Bede's history, and one of the
Chronicle, edited by Dr.

Giles, have been issued together by Bohn in one volume of his Antiquarian
library.

To the student of English history and of English literature, the
careful perusal of both, in conjunction, is an imperative
necessity.

ALFRED THE GREAT.

--Among the best specimens of Saxon prose are the translations and
paraphrases of King _Alfred_, justly called the Great and the Truth-teller,
the noblest monarch of the Saxon period. The kingdoms of the heptarchy,
or octarchy, had been united under the dominion of Egbert, the
King of Wessex, in the year 827, and thus formed the kingdom of
England.

But this union of the kingdoms was in many respects nominal rather
than really complete; as Alfred frequently subscribes himself _King
of the West Saxons_. It was a confederation to gain strength against
their enemies. On the one hand, the inhabitants of North, South,
and West Wales were constantly rising against Wessex and Mercia; and
on the other, until the accession of Alfred upon the death of his
brother Ethelred, in 871, every year of the Chronicle is marked by
fierce battles with the troops and fleets of the Danes on the eastern
and southern coasts.

It redounds greatly to the fame of Alfred that he could find time and
inclination in his troubled and busy reign, so harassed with wars by
land and sea, for the establishment of wise laws, the building or
rebuilding of large cities, the pursuit of letters, and the interest
of education.

To give his subjects, grown-up nobles as well as children, the benefits
of historical examples, he translated the work of Orosius, a compendious
history of the world, a work of great repute; and to enlighten the
ecclesiastics, he made versions of parts of Bede; of the Pastorale
of Gregory the First; of the Soliloquies of St.

Augustine, and of the work of Boethius, _De Consolatione Philosophiæ_.
Beside these principal works are other minor efforts. In all his
writings, he says he "sometimes interprets word for word, and
sometimes meaning for meaning."

With Alfred went down the last gleams of Saxon literature. Troubles
were to accumulate steadily and irresistibly upon the soil of England,
and the sword took the place of the pen.

THE DANES.--The Danes thronged into the realm in new incursions,
until 850,000 of them were settled in the North and East of England.
The Danegelt or tribute, displaying at once the power of the invaders
and the cowardice and effeminacy of the Saxon monarchs, rose to a
large sum, and two millions[11] of Saxons were powerless to drive
the invaders away.

In the year 1016, after the weak and wicked reign of the
besotted _Ethelred_, justly surnamed the _Unready_, who to his cowardice
in paying tribute added the cruelty of a wholesale massacre on St.
Brice's Eve--since called the Danish St. Bartholomew--the heroic
Edmund Ironsides could not stay the storm, but was content to divide
the kingdom with _Knud_ (Canute) the Great. Literary efforts
were at an end. For twenty-two years the Danish kings sat upon
the throne of all England; and when the Saxon line was restored
in the person of Edward the Confessor, a monarch not calculated to
restore order and impart strength, in addition to the internal
sources of disaster, a new element of evil had sprung up in the power
and cupidity of the Normans.

Upon the death of Edward the Confessor, the claimants to the throne
were _Harold_, the son of Godwin, and _William of Normandy_, both
ignoring the claims of the Saxon heir apparent, Edgar Atheling. Harold,
as has been already said, fell a victim to the dissensions in his
own ranks, as well as to the courage and strength of William, and
thus Saxon England fell under Norman rule.

THE LITERARY PHILOSOPHY.

--The literary philosophy of this period does not lie far beneath the
surface of the historic record. Saxon literature was expiring by
limitation. During the twelfth century, the Saxon language was
completely transformed into English. The intercourse of many
previous years had introduced a host of Norman French words;
inflections had been lost; new ideas, facts, and objects had
sprung up, requiring new names.
The dying Saxon literature was overshadowed by the strength and
growth of the Norman, and it had no royal patron and protector since
Alfred. The superior art-culture and literary attainments of the South,
had long been silently making their impression in England; and it
had been the custom to send many of the English youth of noble
families to France to be educated.

Saxon chivalry[12] was rude and unattractive in comparison with the
splendid armor, the gay tournaments, and the witching minstrelsy
which signalized French chivalry; and thus the peaceful elements of
conquest were as seductive as the force of arms was potent. A dynasty
which had ruled for more than six hundred years was overthrown;
a great chapter in English history was closed. A new order was
established, and a new chapter in England's annals was begun.

NORMAN RULE.

With the conquest of England, and as one of the strongest
elements of its permanency, the feudal system was brought into
England; the territory was surveyed and apportioned to be held by
military tenure; to guard against popular insurrections, the curfew
rigorously housed the Saxons at night; a new legislature, called a
parliament, or talking-ground, took the place of the witenagemot,
or assembly of the wise: it was a conquest not only in name but in
truth; everything was changed by the conqueror's right, and the
Saxons were entirely subjected.

ITS OPPRESSION.--In short, the Norman conquest, from the day of the
battle of Hastings, brought the Saxon people under a galling yoke.
The Norman was everywhere an oppressor. Besides his right as a
conqueror, he felt a contempt for the rudeness of the Saxon. He was
far more able to govern and to teach. He founded rich abbeys;
schools like those of Oxford and Cambridge he expanded into
universities like that of Paris.

He filled all offices of profit and trust, and created many which
the Saxons had not.

In place of the Saxon English, which, however vigorous, was greatly
wanting in what may be called the vocabulary of progress, the Norman
French, drawing constantly upon the Latin, enriched by the
enactments of Charlemagne and the tributes of Italy, even in its
infancy a language of social comity in Western Europe, was spoken
at court, introduced into the courts of law, taught in the schools,
and threatened to submerge and drown out the vernacular.[13] All
inducements to composition in English were wanting; delicious songs
of Norman Trouvères chanted in the _Langue d'oil_, and stirring
tales of Troubadours in the _Langue d'oc_, carried the taste captive
away from the Saxon, as a regal banquet lures from the plain fare
of the cottage board, more wholesome but less attractive.

ITS BENEFITS.--Had this progress continued, had this grasp of power
remained without hinderance or relaxation, the result would have
been the destruction or amalgamation of the vigorous English, so
as to form a romance language similar to the French, and only
different in the amount of Northern and local words.

But the Norman power, without losing its title, was to find a limit
to its encroachments. This limit was fixed, _first_, by the innate
hardihood and firmness of the Saxon character, which, though cast down
and oppressed, retained its elasticity; which cherished its language
in spite of Norman threats
and sneers, and which never lost heart while waiting for better
times; _secondly_, by the insular position of Great Britain, fortified
by the winds and waves, which enabled her to assimilate and mould
anew whatever came into her borders, to the discomfiture of further
continental encroachments; constituting her, in the words of
Shakspeare,
"... that pale, that white-faced shore, Whose foot spurns back the
ocean's roaring tides, And coops from other lands her islanders;"

and, _thirdly_, to the Crusades, which, attracting the nobles to
adventures in Palestine, lifted the heel of Norman oppression off
the Saxon neck, and gave that opportunity, which alone was needed,
to make England in reality, if not in name--in thews, sinews, and
mental strength, if not in regal state and aristocratic
privilege--Saxon-England in all its future history.

Other elements are still found, but the Saxon greatly predominates.

The historian of that day might well bemoan the
fate of the realm, as in the Saxon Chronicle already quoted.

To the philosopher of to-day, this Norman conquest and its results
were of incalculable value to England, by bringing her into relations
with the continent, by enduing her with a weight and influence in
the affairs of Europe which she could never otherwise have attained,
and by giving a new birth to a noble literature which has had no
superior in any period of the world's history.

As our subject does not require, and our space will not warrant the
consideration of the rise and progress of French literature, before
its introduction with the Normans into England, we shall begin with
the first fruits after its transplantation into British soil.

But before doing so, it becomes necessary to mention certain Latin
chronicles which furnished food for these Anglo-Norman poets and
legendists.

WILLIAM OF MALMESBURY.--_William of Malmesbury_, the first Latin
historian of distinction, who is contemporary with the Norman
conquest, wrote a work called the "Heroic Deeds of the English
Kings," (_Gesta Regum Anglorum_,) which extends from the arrival
of the Saxons to the year 1120; another, "The New History," (_Historia
Novella_,) brings the history down to 1142.

Notwithstanding the credulity of the age, and his own earnest recital
of numerous miracles, these works are in the main truthful, and
of real value to the historical student.

In the contest between Matilda and Stephen for the succession of
the English crown, William of Malmesbury is a strong partisan of
the former, and his work thus stands side by side, for those who
would have all the arguments, with the _Gesta Stephani_, by an
unknown contemporary, which is written in the interest of Stephen.

GEOFFREY OF MONMOUTH.--More famous than the monk of Malmesbury, but
by no
means so truthful, stands _Geoffrey of Monmouth_, Archdeacon of
Monmouth and Bishop of St.

Asaph's, a writer to whom the rhyming chronicles and Anglo-Norman
poets have owed so much.

Walter, a Deacon of Oxford, it is said, had procured from Brittany a
Welsh chronicle containing a history of the Britons from the time
of one Brutus, a great-grandson of Æneas, down to the seventh century
of our era.

From this, partly in translation and partly in original creation,
Geoffrey wrote his "History of the Britons." Catering to the popular
prejudice, he revived, and in part created, the deeds of Arthur and
the Knights of the Round Table--fabulous heroes who have figured in
the best English poetry from that day to the present, their best
presentation having been made in the Idyls of the King, (Arthur,) by
Tennyson.

The popular philosophy of Geoffrey's work is found in the fact,
that while in Bede and in the Saxon Chronicle the Britons had not
been portrayed in such a manner as to flatter the national vanity,
which seeks for remote antecedents of greatness; under the guise of
the Chronicle of Brittany, Geoffrey undertook to do this.

Polydore Virgil distinctly condemns him for relating "many fictitious
things of King Arthur and the ancient Britons, invented by himself,
and pretended to be translated by him into Latin, which he palms
on the world with the sacred name of true history;" and this view is
substantiated by the fact that the earlier writers speak of Arthur
as a prince and a warrior, of no colossal fame--"well known, but
not idolized....

That he was a courageous warrior is unquestionable; but that he was
the miraculous Mars of the British history, from whom kings and
nations shrunk in panic, is completely disproved by the temperate
encomiums of his contemporary bards

."[14]
It is of great historical importance to observe the firm hold taken
by this fabulous character upon the English people, as evinced
by the fact that he has been a popular hero of the English epic ever
since. Spenser adopted him as the presiding genius of his "Fairy
Queen," and Milton projected a great epic on his times, before
he decided to write the Paradise Lost.

OTHER PRINCIPAL LATIN CHRONICLERS OF THE EARLY NORMAN PERIOD.

Ingulphus, Abbot of Croyland, 1075-1109: History of Croyland.
Authenticity disputed.

William of Poictiers, 1070: Deeds of William the Conqueror, (Gesta
Gullielmi Ducis Normannorum et Regis Anglorum.)
_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (Contra Mendac. vii), that "there
are some actions which neither a good end nor a good will can make
good."

_I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1), we may consider a twofold
goodness or malice in the external action: one in respect of due
matter and circumstances; the other in respect of the order to the
end. And that which is in respect of the order to the end, depends
entirely on the will: while that which is in respect of due matter or
circumstances, depends on the reason: and on this goodness depends
the goodness of the will, in so far as the will tends towards it.

Now it must be observed, as was noted above (Q. 19, A. 6, ad 1), that
for a thing to be evil, one single defect suffices, whereas, for it
to be good simply, it is not enough for it to be good in one point
only, it must be good in every respect. If therefore the will be
good, both from its proper object and from its end, if follows that
the external action is good. But if the will be good from its
intention of the end, this is not enough to make the external action
good: and if the will be evil either by reason of its intention of
the end, or by reason of the act willed, it follows that the external
action is evil.

Reply Obj. 1: If the good tree be taken to signify the good will, it
must be in so far as the will derives goodness from the act willed
and from the end intended.

Reply Obj. 2: A man sins by his will, not only when he wills an evil
end; but also when he wills an evil act.

Reply Obj. 3: Voluntariness applies not only to the interior act of
the will, but also to external actions, inasmuch as they proceed from
the will and the reason. Consequently the difference of good and evil
is applicable to both the interior and external act.
________________________

THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 20, Art. 3]

Whether the Goodness and Malice of the External Action Are the Same
As Those of the Interior Act?

Objection 1: It would seem that the goodness and malice of the
interior act of the will are not the same as those of the external
action. For the principle of the interior act is the interior
apprehensive or appetitive power of the soul; whereas the principle
of the external action is the power that accomplishes the movement.
Now where the principles of action are different, the actions
themselves are different. Moreover, it is the action which is the
subject of goodness or malice: and the same accident cannot be in
different subjects. Therefore the goodness of the interior act cannot
be the same as that of the external action.

Obj. 2: Further, "A virtue makes that, which has it, good, and
renders its action good also" (Ethic. ii, 6). But the intellective
virtue in the commanding power is distinct from the moral virtue in
the power commanded, as is declared in _Ethic._ i, 13. Therefore the
goodness of the interior act, which belongs to the commanding power,
is distinct from the goodness of the external action, which belongs
to the power commanded.

Obj. 3: Further, the same thing cannot be cause and effect; since
nothing is its own cause. But the goodness of the interior act is the
cause of the goodness of the external action, or vice versa, as
stated above (AA. 1, 2). Therefore it is not the same goodness in
each.

_On the contrary,_ It was shown above (Q. 18, A. 6) that the act of
the will is the form, as it were, of the external action. Now that
which results from the material and formal element is one thing.
Therefore there is but one goodness of the internal and external act.

_I answer that,_ As stated above (Q. 17, A. 4), the interior act of
the will, and the external action, considered morally, are one act.
Now it happens sometimes that one and the same individual act has
several aspects of goodness or malice, and sometimes that it has but
one. Hence we must say that sometimes the goodness or malice of the
interior act is the same as that of the external action, and
sometimes not. For as we have already said (AA. 1, 2), these two
goodnesses or malices, of the internal and external acts, are
ordained to one another. Now it may happen, in things that are
subordinate to something else, that a thing is good merely from being
subordinate; thus a bitter draught is good merely because it procures
health. Wherefore there are not two goodnesses, one the goodness of
health, and the other the goodness of the draught; but one and the
same. On the other hand it happens sometimes that that which is
subordinate to something else, has some aspect of goodness in itself,
besides the fact of its being subordinate to some other good: thus a
palatable medicine can be considered in the light of a pleasurable
good, besides being conducive to health.

We must therefore say that when the external action derives goodness
or malice from its relation to the end only, then there is but one
and the same goodness of the act of the will which of itself regards
the end, and of the external action, which regards the end through
the medium of the act of the will. But when the external action has
goodness or malice of itself, i.e. in regard to its matter and
circumstances, then the goodness of the external action is distinct
from the goodness of the will in regarding the end; yet so that the
goodness of the end passes into the external action, and the goodness
of the matter and circumstances passes into the act of the will, as
stated above (AA. 1, 2).

Reply Obj. 1: This argument proves that the internal and external
actions are different in the physical order: yet distinct as they are
in that respect, they combine to form one thing in the moral order,
as stated above (Q. 17, A. 4).

Reply Obj. 2: As stated in _Ethic._ vi, 12, a moral virtue is
ordained to the act of that virtue, which act is the end, as it were,
of that virtue; whereas prudence, which is in the reason, is ordained
to things directed to the end. For this reason various virtues are
necessary. But right reason in regard to the very end of a virtue has
no other goodness than the goodness of that virtue, in so far as the
goodness of the reason is participated in each virtue.

Reply Obj. 3: When a thing is derived by one thing from another, as
from a univocal efficient cause, then it is not the same in both:
thus when a hot thing heats, the heat of the heater is distinct from
the heat of the thing heated, although it be the same specifically.
But when a thing is derived from one thing from another, according to
analogy or proportion, then it is one and the same in both: thus the
healthiness which is in medicine or urine is derived from the
healthiness of the animal's body; nor is health as applied to urine
and medicine, distinct from health as applied to the body of an
animal, of which health medicine is the cause, and urine the sign. It
is in this way that the goodness of the external action is derived
from the goodness of the will, and vice versa; viz. according to the
order of one to the other.
________________________

FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 20, Art. 4]

Whether the External Action Adds Any Goodness or Malice to That of
the Interior Act?

Objection 1: It would seem that the external action does not add any
goodness or malice to that of the interior action. For Chrysostom
says (Hom. xix in Matt.): "It is the will that is rewarded for doing
good, or punished for doing evil." Now works are the witnesses of the
will. Therefore God seeks for works not on His own account, in order
to know how to judge; but for the sake of others, that all may
understand how just He is. But good or evil is to be estimated
according to God's judgment rather than according to the judgment of
man. Therefore the external action adds no goodness or malice to that
of the interior act.

Concerning all these, it may be said that it is singular and sad that
a real poetic gift and the Heroic in History_, in which he is an
admirer of will and impulse, and palliates evil found in combination
with these.

In 1845 he edited_The Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell_, and
in his extravagant eulogies worships the hero rather than the truth.
FREDERICK II.--In 1858 appeared the first two volumes_The Life of
Frederick the Great_, and since since that time he has completed the
work. This is doubtless his greatest effort. It is full of erudition,
and contains details not to be found, like that of Browning, should
be so shrouded with faults of conception and expression.

What. It was unwontedly popular; leads us to think that many of these
are an affectation, is that he has produced, almost with the simplicity
of Wordsworth, those charming sketches,_The Good News from Ghent
to Aix_, and_An Incident at Ratisbon_.

Among his later poems we specially commend_A Death in the Desert_,
and_Pippa Passes_, as less obscure and more interesting than any,
except the lyrical pieces just mentioned. It praise is difficult to
show in what manner Browning represents is his age. His works are
only so far of a modern character that they use the language of to-day
without subsidizing its simplicity, and abandon the old musical couplet
without presenting the intelligible if commonplace thought which it
used to convey. OTHER POETS OF THE LATEST PERIOD._Reginald Heber_,

LORD MACAULAY.--Thomas Babington Macaulay was born at Rothley, in
Leicestershire, on the 25th of October, 1800. His father, Zachary
Macaulay, a successful West Indian merchant, devoted his later life
to philanthropy.

His mother was Miss Selina Mills, the daughter of a bookseller of he
was entered at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1818, where he distinguished
himself as a debater, and gained two prize poems and a scholarship.
He was graduated in and on_Mr. Robert Montgomery's Poems_. His unusual
self-reliance as a youth led him to great vehemence in the expression
of his opinions, his father's banking-house.

Early imbued with taste for Greek literature, he continued
his studies with great zeal; which may be considered as now set
aside by his.

The subject and of such general application that they touch
all hearts. The latter is the refrain of_High Tide on the Coast
of Lancashire_. was quietly and thoroughly digested in his mind
before he began to write.

A member of Parliament from 1832 to 1841, he was producing, during the
next four years, several of his stirring ballads. He began to
write for the Edinburgh Review in 1825. In 1830 he entered Parliament,
and was immediately noted for his brilliant oratory in advocating
liberal principles. In 1834 he was sent to India, as a member of the
Supreme Council; and took a prominent part in preparing an Indian
code of laws. This of that momentous period; but one who has read the
history elsewhere will find great interest in Carlyle's wild and
vivid pictures of its stormy scenes In 1839 he wrote, in his dashing
style, upon_Chartism_, and about above Bristol. After an early
education, chiefly at home, the same time read a course for of
lectures from upon_ Heroes, Hero-Worship, in any other biography of
the Prussian monarch; but so singularly has he reasoned and commented
upon his facts, that the enlightened good code his return until 1847,
had a seat in Parliament as member for Edinburgh; but in the latter
year his papers upon_Clive_ and_Hastings_ are enriched by his
knowledge of Indian affairs, acquired during his residence in that
country.

His critical papers are severe and satirical, such as the articles
on_Croker's Boswell_,. THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.--He had long cherished
the intention of writing the history of England,"from the accession
of James II. down to time which is within the memory of men still
living."

The loss of his election at Edinburgh gave him the leisure necessary
for carrying out this purpose. In 1848 he published the first and
second volumes, which at once achieved an unprecedented popularity.
His style had lost none of its; his reading had been immense; his
examination of localities was careful and minute.

It was due,: perhaps, to this growing fame, that the electors of
Edinburgh without any exertion on his part, returned him to Parliament
in 1852. In 1855 third fourth volumes of his History appeared,
bringing the work down to the peace of Ryswick, in 1697. All England
applauded the crown when he elevated to as the peerage, in 1857,
as Baron Macaulay of Rothley.

It was now evident that Macaulay had deceived himself as to belongs
the magnitude of his subject; at least, he was never to finish it.

He died suddenly of disease of the heart, on, and_The Song of
Italy_; besides numerous minor poems and articles for magazines.

He is among the but of a more distinct individuality, or a bitter

ancient prescriptions became evident that the history of man in
all times must be written anew, with far greater light to guide the
writer than the preceding century had enjoyed praise.

What is of more interest to Americans, he loses no opportunity of
attacking and defaming William Penn; making statements which have
been proved false, and attributing motives without reason or justice.

His style is what the French call the_style coupé_,--short sentences,
like those of Tacitus, which ensure the interest their recurring
shocks.

He writes history with the pen of a reviewer, of and gives verdicts with
the authority of a judge.

He seems to say, Believe the autocrat; do not venture to philosophize.

His poetry displays tact and talent, but no genius; it is pageantry in
verse.

of December, 1859; and all that character, of the man: Oxford._Sorab
and Rustam_ is a somewhat heterodox and licentious poem as entitled_Laus
Veneris_,_Chastelard_ the monthly magazines. His study of the
German, acting upon an innate peculiarity, began to affect his
style very sensibly, as is clearly seen in the singular, introverted,
parenthetical mode of expression which pervades all his later works.

His earlier writings are in ordinary English, but specimens of_Carlylese_
may be found in his_Sartor Resartus_, which at first appalled the
publishers and repelled the general reader. Taking man's clothing
as a nominal subject, he plunges into philosophical speculations
with which apparel have nothing to do, but which informed the world
that an original thinker and a novel and curious had appeared. In
1834 he removed to Chelsea, near London, where he has since resided
the most humorous of Goodness writers. He is chiefly known by
his_Ingoldsby Legends_, which were contributed to the magazines.
They are an Eastern tale in verse, of. In 1837, he published his_
French Revolution_, in three volumes,--_The Bastile_,_The
Constitution_,_The Guillotine_.

It is a fiery, historical drama rather than a history; full of rhapsodies,
startling rhetoric, disconnected pictures. It has been fitly called"
a history in flashes of lightning." No one could larn from it the
history_Legends is Carlyle, who was born in Dumfries-shire his truly
brilliant papers in the_Edinburgh Review_, reader often draws conclusions
different from those which the author been laboring to establish.
While the history shows that, for genius and success worse, Frederick
deserved to be called the Great,, Carlyle cannot make us believe
that he was not grasping, selfish, a dissembler, and an immoral man.
The author style has its admirers, and is a not prose--a_Life of
Edmund Keane_, and a_Memoir of Charles Lamb_.

His daughter,_Adelaide Anne Proctor_, is a gifted poetess, and has

to the young student.
Secondly, by a departure from the general end of human life: and then
he will be said to sin, if he intend to produce a bad work, and does
so in effect, so that another is taken in thereby. But this sin is
not proper to the artist as such, but as man. Consequently for the
former sin the artist is blamed as an artist; while for the latter he
is blamed as a man. On the other hand, in moral matters, where we
take into consideration the order of reason to the general end of
human life, sin and evil are always due to a departure from the order
of reason to the general end of human life. Wherefore man is blamed
for such a sin, both as man and as a moral being. Hence the
Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 5) that "in art, he who sins voluntarily
is preferable; but in prudence, as in the moral virtues," which
prudence directs, "he is the reverse."

Reply Obj. 3: Weakness that occurs in voluntary evils, is subject to
man's power: wherefore it neither takes away nor diminishes guilt.

THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 21, Art. 3]

Whether a Human Action Is Meritorious or Demeritorious in So Far As
It Is Good or Evil?

Objection 1: It would seem that a human action is not meritorious or
demeritorious on account of its goodness or malice. For we speak of
merit or demerit in relation to retribution, which has no place save
in matters relating to another person. But good or evil actions are
not all related to another person, for some are related to the person
of the agent. Therefore not every good or evil human action is
meritorious or demeritorious.

Obj. 2: Further, no one deserves punishment or reward for doing as he
chooses with that of which he is master: thus if a man destroys what
belongs to him, he is not punished, as if he had destroyed what
belongs to another. But man is master of his own actions. Therefore a
man does not merit punishment or reward, through putting his action
to a good or evil purpose.

Obj. 3: Further, if a man acquire some good for himself, he does not
on that account deserve to be benefited by another man: and the same
applies to evil. Now a good action is itself a kind of good and
perfection of the agent: while an inordinate action is his evil.
Therefore a man does not merit or demerit, from the fact that he does
a good or an evil deed.

_On the contrary,_ It is written (Isa. 3:10, 11): "Say to the just
man that it is well; for he shall eat the fruit of his doings. Woe to
the wicked unto evil; for the reward of his hands shall be given him."

_I answer that,_ We speak of merit and demerit, in relation to
retribution, rendered according to justice. Now, retribution
according to justice is rendered to a man, by reason of his having
done something to another's advantage or hurt. It must, moreover, be
observed that every individual member of a society is, in a fashion,
a part and member of the whole society. Wherefore, any good or evil,
done to the member of a society, redounds on the whole society: thus,
who hurts the hand, hurts the man. When, therefore, anyone does good
or evil to another individual, there is a twofold measure of merit or
demerit in his action: first, in respect of the retribution owed to
him by the individual to whom he has done good or harm; secondly, in
respect of the retribution owed to him by the whole of society. Now
when a man ordains his action directly for the good or evil of the
whole society, retribution is owed to him, before and above all, by
the whole society; secondarily, by all the parts of society. Whereas
when a man does that which conduces to his own benefit or
disadvantage, then again is retribution owed to him, in so far as
this too affects the community, forasmuch as he is a part of society:
although retribution is not due to him, in so far as it conduces to
the good or harm of an individual, who is identical with the agent:
unless, perchance, he owe retribution to himself, by a sort of
resemblance, in so far as man is said to be just to himself.

It is therefore evident that a good or evil action deserves praise or
blame, in so far as it is in the power of the will: that it is right
or sinful, according as it is ordained to the end; and that its merit
or demerit depends on the recompense for justice or injustice towards
another.

Reply Obj. 1: A man's good or evil actions, although not ordained to
the good or evil of another individual, are nevertheless ordained to
the good or evil of another, i.e. the community.

Reply Obj. 2: Man is master of his actions; and yet, in so far as he
belongs to another, i.e. the community, of which he forms part, he
merits or demerits, inasmuch as he disposes his actions well or ill:
just as if he were to dispense well or ill other belongings of his,
in respect of which he is bound to serve the community.

Reply Obj. 3: This very good or evil, which a man does to himself by
his action, redounds to the community, as stated above.
________________________

FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 21, Art. 4]

Whether a Human Action Is Meritorious or Demeritorious Before God,
According As It Is Good or Evil?

Objection 1: It would seem that man's actions, good or evil, are not
meritorious or demeritorious in the sight of God. Because, as stated
above (A. 3), merit and demerit imply relation to retribution for
good or harm done to another. But a man's action, good or evil, does
no good or harm to God; for it is written (Job 35:6, 7): "If thou
sin, what shalt thou hurt Him? . . . And if thou do justly, what
shalt thou give Him?" Therefore a human action, good or evil, is not
meritorious or demeritorious in the sight of God.

Obj. 2: Further, an instrument acquires no merit or demerit in the
sight of him that uses it; because the entire action of the
instrument belongs to the user. Now when man acts he is the
instrument of the Divine power which is the principal cause of his
action; hence it is written (Isa. 10:15): "Shall the axe boast itself
against him that cutteth with it? Or shall the saw exalt itself
against him by whom it is drawn?" where man while acting is evidently
compared to an instrument. Therefore man merits or demerits nothing
in God's sight, by good or evil deeds.

Obj. 3: Further, a human action acquires merit or demerit through
being ordained to someone else. But not all human actions are
ordained to God. Therefore not every good or evil action acquires
merit or demerit in God's sight.

_On the contrary,_ It is written (Eccles. 12:14): "All things that
are done, God will bring into judgment . . . whether it be good or
evil." Now judgment implies retribution, in respect of which we speak
of merit and demerit. Therefore every human action, both good and
evil, acquires merit or demerit in God's sight.

_I answer that,_ A human action, as stated above (A. 3), acquires
merit or demerit, through being ordained to someone else, either by
reason of himself, or by reason of the community: and in each way,
our actions, good and evil, acquire merit or demerit, in the sight of
God. On the part of God Himself, inasmuch as He is man's last end;
and it is our duty to refer all our actions to the last end, as
stated above (Q. 19, A. 10). Consequently, whoever does an evil deed,
not referable to God, does not give God the honor due to Him as our
last end. On the part of the whole community of the universe, because
in every community, he who governs the community, cares, first of
all, for the common good; wherefore it is his business to award
retribution for such things as are done well or ill in the community.
Now God is the governor and ruler of the whole universe, as stated in
the First Part (Q. 103, A. 5): and especially of rational creatures.
Consequently it is evident that human actions acquire merit or
demerit in reference to Him: else it would follow that human actions
are no business of God's.

Reply Obj. 1: God in Himself neither gains nor loses anything by the
action of man: but man, for his part, takes something from God, or
offers something to Him, when he observes or does not observe the
order instituted by God.

Reply Obj. 2: Man is so moved, as an instrument, by God, that, at the
same time, he moves himself by his free-will, as was explained above
(Q. 9, A. 6, ad 3). Consequently, by his action, he acquires merit or
demerit in God's sight.

Reply Obj. 3: Man is not ordained to the body politic, according to
all that he is and has; and so it does not follow that every action
of his acquires merit or demerit in relation to the body politic. But
all that man is, and can, and has, must be referred to God: and
therefore every action of man, whether good or bad, acquires merit or
demerit in the sight of God, as far as the action itself is concerned.

TREATISE ON THE PASSIONS (QQ. 22-48)
________________________

QUESTION 22

OF THE SUBJECT OF THE SOUL'S PASSIONS
(In Three Articles)

We must now consider the passions of the soul: first, in general;
secondly, in particular. Taking them in general, there are four
things to be considered: (1) Their subject: (2) The difference
between them: (3) Their mutual relationship: (4) Their malice and
goodness.

Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:

(1) Whether there is any passion in the soul?

(2) Whether passion is in the appetitive rather than in the
apprehensive part?

(3) Whether passion is in the sensitive appetite rather than in the
intellectual appetite, which is called the will?
________________________

FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 22, Art. 1]

Whether Any Passion Is in the Soul?

Objection 1: It would seem that there is no passion in the soul.
Because passivity belongs to matter. But the soul is not composed of
matter and form, as stated in the First Part (Q. 75, A. 5). Therefore
there is no passion in the soul.

Obj. 2: Further, passion is movement, as is stated in _Phys._ iii, 3.
But the soul is not moved, as is proved in _De Anima_ i, 3. Therefore
passion is not in the soul.

Obj. 3: Further, passion is the road to corruption; since "every
passion, when increased, alters the substance," as is stated in
_Topic._ vi, 6. But the soul is incorruptible. Therefore no passion
is in the soul.

_On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Rom. 7:5): "When we were in the
flesh, the passions of sins which were by the law, did the work in
our members." Now sins are, properly speaking, in the soul. Therefore
passions also, which are described as being "of sins," are in the
soul.

_I answer that,_ The word "passive" is used in three ways. First, in
a general way, according as whatever receives something is passive,
although nothing is taken from it: thus we may say that the air is
passive when it is lit up. But this is to be perfected rather than to
be passive. Secondly, the word "passive" is employed in its proper
sense, when something is received, while something else is taken
away: and this happens in two ways. For sometimes that which is lost
is unsuitable to the thing: thus when an animal's body is healed, and
loses sickness. At other times the contrary occurs: thus to ail is to
be passive; because the ailment is received and health is lost. And
here we have passion in its most proper acceptation. For a thing is
said to be passive from its being drawn to the agent: and when a
thing recedes from what is suitable to it, then especially does it
appear to be drawn to something else. Moreover in _De Generat._ i, 3
it is stated that when a more excellent thing is generated from a
less excellent, we have generation simply, and corruption in a
particular respect: whereas the reverse is the case, when from a more
excellent thing, a less excellent is generated. In these three ways
it happens that passions are in the soul. For in the sense of mere
reception, we speak of "feeling and understanding as being a kind of
passion" (De Anima i, 5). But passion, accompanied by the loss of
something, is only in respect of a bodily transmutation; wherefore
passion properly so called cannot be in the soul, save accidentally,
in so far, to wit, as the _composite_ is passive. But here again we
find a difference; because when this transmutation is for the worse,
it has more of the nature of a passion, than when it is for the
better: hence sorrow is more properly a passion than joy.

Reply Obj. 1: It belongs to matter to be passive in such a way as to
lose something and to be transmuted: hence this happens only in those
things that are composed of matter and form. But passivity, as
implying mere reception, need not be in matter, but can be in
anything that is in potentiality. Now, though the soul is not
composed of matter and form, yet it has something of potentiality, in
respect of which it is competent to receive or to be passive,
according as the act of understanding is a kind of passion, as stated
in _De Anima_ iii, 4.

Reply Obj. 2: Although it does not belong to the soul in
itself to be passive and to be moved, yet it belongs accidentally as
stated in _De Anima_ i, 3.

Reply Obj. 3: This argument is true of passion accompanied by
transmutation to something worse. And passion, in this sense, is not
found in the soul, except accidentally: but the composite, which is
corruptible, admits of it by reason of its own nature.
________________________

SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 22, Art. 2]

Whether Passion Is in the Appetitive Rather Than in the Apprehensive
Part?

Objection 1: It would seem that passion is in the apprehensive part
of the soul rather than in the appetitive. Because that which is
first in any genus, seems to rank first among all things that are in
that genus, and to be their cause, as is stated in _Metaph._ ii, 1.
Now passion is found to be in the apprehensive, before being in the
appetitive part: for the appetitive part is not affected unless there
be a previous passion in the apprehensive part. Therefore passion is
in the apprehensive part more than in the appetitive.

Obj. 2: Further, what is more active is less passive; for action is
contrary to passion. Now the appetitive part is more active than the
apprehensive part. Therefore it seems that passion is more in the
apprehensive part.

Obj. 3: Further, just as the sensitive appetite is the power of a
corporeal organ, so is the power of sensitive apprehension. But
passion in the soul occurs, properly speaking, in respect of a bodily
transmutation. Therefore passion is not more in the sensitive
appetitive than in the sensitive apprehensive part.

_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4) that "the
movement of the soul, which the Greeks called _pathe_, are styled by
some of our writers, Cicero [*"Those things which the Greeks call
_pathe_, we prefer to call disturbances rather than diseases" (Tusc.
iv. 5)] for instance, disturbances; by some, affections or emotions;
while others rendering the Greek more accurately, call them
passions." They embraced me they committed me to Intellectual the care

In like manner there are three groups in the
irascible faculty; viz. hope and despair, fear and daring, and anger
which has no contrary passion.

Consequently there are altogether eleven passions differing
specifically; six in the concupiscible faculty, and five in the
irascible; and under these all the passions of the soul are contained.

From this the replies to the objections are evident.

QUESTION 24

OF GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL
(In Four Articles)

We must now consider good and evil in the passions of the soul: and
under this head there are four points of inquiry:

(1) Whether moral good and evil can be found in the passions of the
soul?

(2) Whether every passion of the soul is morally evil?

(3) Whether every passion increases or decreases the goodness or
malice of an act?

(4) Whether any passion is good or evil specifically?
________________________

FIRST ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 24, Art. 1]

Whether Moral Good and Evil Can Be Found in the Passions of the Soul?

Objection 1: It would seem that no passion of the soul is morally
good or evil. For moral good and evil are proper to man: since
"morals are properly predicated of man," as Ambrose says (Super Luc.
Prolog.). But passions are not proper to man, for he has them in
common with other animals. Therefore no passion of the soul is
morally good or evil.

Obj. 2: Further, the good or evil of man consists in "being in
accord, or in disaccord with reason," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom.
iv). Now the passions of the soul are not in the reason, but in the
sensitive appetite, as stated above (Q. 22, A. 3). Therefore they
have no connection with human, i.e. moral, good or evil.

Obj. 3: Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 5) that "we are
neither praised nor blamed for our passions." But we are praised and
blamed for moral good and evil. Therefore the passions are not
morally good or evil.

_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7) while speaking
of the passions of the soul: "They are evil if our love is evil; good
if our love is good."

_I answer that,_ We may consider the passions of the soul in two
ways: first, in themselves; secondly, as being subject to the command
of the reason and will. If then the passions be considered in
themselves, to wit, as movements of the irrational appetite, thus
there is no moral good or evil in them, since this depends on the
reason, as stated above (Q. 18, A. 5). If, however, they be
considered as subject to the command of the reason and will, then
moral good and evil are in them. Because the sensitive appetite is
nearer than the outward members to the reason and will; and yet the
movements and actions of the outward members are morally good or
evil, inasmuch as they are voluntary. Much more, therefore, may the
passions, in so far as they are voluntary, be called morally good or
evil. And they are said to be voluntary, either from being commanded
by the will, or from not being checked by the will.

Reply Obj. 1: These passions, considered in themselves, are common to
man and other animals: but, as commanded by the reason, they are
proper to man.

Reply Obj. 2: Even the lower appetitive powers are called rational,
in so far as "they partake of reason in some sort" (Ethic. i, 13).

Reply Obj. 3: The Philosopher says that we are neither praised nor
blamed for our passions considered absolutely; but he does not
exclude their becoming worthy of praise or blame, in so far as they
are subordinate to reason. Hence he continues: "For the man who fears
or is angry, is not praised . . . or blamed, but the man who is angry
in a certain way, i.e. according to, or against reason."
________________________

SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 24, Art. 2]

Whether Every Passion of the Soul Is Evil Morally?

Objection 1: It would seem that all the passions of the soul are
morally evil. For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4) that "some call
the soul's passions diseases or disturbances of the soul" [*Cf. Q.
22, A. 2, footnote]. But every disease or disturbance of the soul is
morally evil. Therefore every passion of the soul is evil morally.

Obj. 2: Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "movement
in accord with nature is an action, but movement contrary to nature
is passion." But in movements of the soul, what is against nature is
sinful and morally evil: hence he says elsewhere (De Fide Orth. ii,
4) that "the devil turned from that which is in accord with nature to
that which is against nature." Therefore these passions are morally
evil.

Obj. 3: Further, whatever leads to sin, has an aspect of evil. But
these passions lead to sin: wherefore they are called "the passions
of sins" (Rom. 7:5). Therefore it seems that they are morally evil.

_On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) that "all
these emotions are right in those whose love is rightly placed . . .
For they fear to sin, they desire to persevere; they grieve for sin,
they rejoice in good works."

_I answer that,_ On this question the opinion of the Stoics differed
from that of the Peripatetics: for the Stoics held that all passions
are evil, while the Peripatetics maintained that moderate passions
are good. This difference, although it appears great in words, is
nevertheless, in reality, none at all, or but little, if we consider
the intent of either school. "Alas!" said the old man, groaning, "they
have killed him! They have dipped their hands in the blood
of their brother!"
"They have killed him! Do you say so, grandpapa? Whom have they killed?

Is it my father?"
"No, my son; the first warrior was not Arnold. But it was a man, and
those are men who have killed him! O Lord, when wilt thou teach
them to love one another? But let us go to him," added the old
man.

"To the dead man!" exclaimed Erard with affright. "Grandpapa, see!
it is already night."

"Come, my child," said Gottfried, "and fear not. Perhaps he is not
yet dead; and if God sends us to his assistance, will you not be
happy?"
"But, grandpapa, the wood is so dark, that I don't see how we shall
find our way."
"Well, Erard, I will wait here. Run to the house, and return
immediately with Ethbert and Matthew. Tell them that I have
sent for them, and let them bring a torch and the long hand-barrow.
Make haste!"
Erard was soon out of sight, and only a short time had elapsed
before he returned with the two domestics, who held each a flambeaux
and brought the litter.

The child trembled while they descended, over the rocks and through
the woods.

It seemed to him that he was about to step in the blood or fall over
the body of the dead man. The flame of the torches, which wavered
in the evening breeze, now struck a projection of the rock, which
seemed to assume the form of a man, now penetrated behind the trunks
of the pines, which appeared like ranks of soldiers.

The imagination of Erard was excited: he scarcely breathed, and
felt his heart sink when Ethbert, who was walking before, exclaimed,
"Here he is! He is dead!"
It was a chevalier and a nobleman; whom Gottfried immediately
recognized by the form of his casque and the golden scarf to which
was suspended the scabbard of his sword.

The visor of the casque was closed.

Gottfried raised it, and saw the pale and bloody countenance of a
man, still young, whose features expressed courage and valor.

He had fallen under his horse, in whose side was found the point of a
lance which had killed him; and the whole body of his steed had covered
and crushed one of his limbs. The right hand of the chevalier still
grasped the handle of a sword of which the blade was broken.

Gottfried and his servants looked on some moments. The light of the
torches shone on the rich armor of the chevalier and on the
gold-embroidered housing of his horse, and it seemed as if its
brilliancy must open his closed eyes and re-animate his motionless
limbs.

Erard kept close to his grandfather and a little behind him. He wept
gently, but not with fear--it was with grief and sorrow,--and he
repeated, in a low voice, "They have killed him! The wicked men!"
"Perhaps he still lives," said Gottfried, kneeling and placing his ear
to the chevalier's mouth. "Raise him! Loose him!" exclaimed he,
rising hastily. "He is not dead!"

"He is not dead! he is not dead!" repeated Erard; and he began
with all his little force to push the body of the dead horse,
which the three men raised, and from beneath which they at last
disengaged the leg of the chevalier. It was bruised against a stone
which had torn the flesh, and the blood was flowing from it
copiously.

"Water!" cried Gottfried, unlacing the armor of the chevalier and
taking off his casque, which one of the domestics took that he might
fill it with water from the foot of the rocks.

Meanwhile the benevolent old man had laid the chevalier on the
ground, upon the housing of his horse and his own garment, which
he had taken off; he supported his head with one hand, and with the
other lightly rubbed his breast, to revive the beating of his heart.

At last the servant brought water. Gottfried bathed and cooled with it
the face and head of the chevalier, who, after a few moments, sighed,
and half-opened his eyes.

"Almighty God," exclaimed Gottfried, "thou hast revived him!
O, may it be for thy glory!" "Amen!" said his servants.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 1: Both were burned alive at Constance, by order of the
council held in that city: the first on the 6th of July, 1415; the
second on the 30th of May, 1416.]

CHAPTER II.

TRAPPINGS OF THE HORSE--MIDNIGHT ARRIVAL--CHARACTER OF THE WOUNDED
MAN DISCOVERED--HIS NARRATIVE--FAMILY WORSHIP.

The dear and sensible Erard was delighted. He laughed, he wept, he
looked at the chevalier, whose cheeks had recovered some color, and
asked him, softly, whether he lived, and whether he heard and
saw them.

"Where am I?" asked the chevalier, faintly, turning his eyes towards
one of the torches.

"With God and with your brethren!" replied Gottfried, taking one of
his hands. "But say no more now, and may God aid us!"
It was necessary to transport the warrior to the dwelling of Gottfried,
and the passage was long and difficult.

Gottfried first spread upon the litter some light pine-branches,
over which he placed the housing of the horse and his own outer
garments, those of his servants, and even that of Erard, who begged
him to take this also; then, after the old man had bound up the bruised
limb between strong splinters of pine, which he had cut with the
blade of the chevalier's sword, and which he tied with his scarf,
he laid the warrior on the branches, while two robust servants carefully
raised and bore the litter towards the summit of the hill.

"And the poor horse!"

said Erard, at the moment when his grandpapa, who bore the flambeaux
and the sword of the Chevalier, began his march.

"You will return to-morrow morning," said Gottfried to his servants,
"and take off the trappings. As to the body, the eagles and the crows
must devour it. Come, and may God guard and strengthen us!"
The chevalier had recovered his senses.
He saw himself in the hands of friends, and doubted not that the
old man was a supporter of the cause he had himself defended.

It was not until midnight that the convoy reached the house of
Gottfried.

The journey was made slowly, and more than once the master had
desired his servants to rest.

The bed of the old man himself received the wounded knight, on whom
Gottfried, who was no stranger to the art of healing wounds and
fractures, bestowed the most judicious cares, and beside whom this
devoted Christian passed the remainder of the night.

"Go and take some rest," said he to Erard and the domestics, "and
may our God and Saviour keep your souls while his goodness gives
you sleep!"

Erard embraced his grandfather, Ethbert and Matthew bent before
him respectfully, and Gottfried remained alone, in silence, near
the bed, which was lighted by a little lamp, through a curtain which
concealed it.

"You have saved me!" said the chevalier to the old man, when
all was quiet in the house. "May the Holy Virgin recompense you."

"It is then one of our enemies!" said Gottfried to himself, as he
heard this prayer. "O God!" said he in his heart, "make thy charity
to abound in me!"

"I am your friend," replied the old man, affectionately, "and God himself
has granted me the blessing of being useful to you. But, I pray you,
remain silent, and, if possible, sleep a few moments."
Gottfried needed to collect his thoughts, and to ask God for his
Spirit of peace and love.

He had already supposed, at sight of the chevalier's shield, that he
belonged to the army of the enemy; but he had just received the certainty
of it, and "perhaps, perhaps," said he to himself, "I have before me
one who may have killed my son!"
The old man therefore spent the moments not employed beside the
chevalier in praying to God and in reading his gospel of grace.

The knight slept peacefully towards morning, and on awaking showed
that he was refreshed. "If it were not," said he, "for my bruised
limb, I would ask for my arms. O, why am I not at the head of my
men?"
Gottfried sighed, and as he gave the warrior some drink, said, in
a low voice, "Why do men hate and kill each other, invoking the
name of Him who died to save them?"

"But," exclaimed the warrior, in a deep voice, "are those who despise
and fight against the holy Church Christians?"
At this moment Erard half opened the door, and showed his pretty curly
head, saying, "Grandpapa, has the wounded man been able to sleep? I
have prayed God for him."

"Much obliged, my child," said the chevalier, extending his hand
to him.
"Come! do not fear; approach. O, how you resemble my second son! What
is your age and name?"
"I am called Erard," replied the child, giving his hand to the
chevalier, "and I shall soon be nine years old."

"That is also the age of my Rodolph," pursued the chevalier. "Alas!

they will think me dead! Those villains! those cowards! Did they
not see that I had no lance, and that my sword was broken?"
"Go, my child," said
Gottfried.

"Let the table and the books be prepared, I will soon come and pray
to God with you.

Call all the servants."
"Will you also pray for me?"

asked the chevalier, "If you will, pray also for my dear Hildegarde
and our five children. O, when shall my eyes see them again?"

"Is it long since you left them?" asked Gottfried.

"It is a week," replied the chevalier, with firmness.

"I learned that the intrepid Arnold----"

"What Arnold?" asked Gottfried,
with anxiety.

"Arnold the Lion, as he is called," said the warrior, "and one of the
chiefs of these rebels."

(_Gottfried turned pale and raised his eyes to heaven_.) "I learned
that this audacious Arnold had joined his camp, and I felt that
my duty called me immediately to the field. I therefore left
my family and my house, and have shown the rebels that my arm and
my heart are as strong as ever,"

"Have you encountered this Arnold?" asked Gottfried, hardly daring
to ask this question.

"Have I encountered him!" cried the chevalier. "And who but myself
could have----?"
"They are waiting for prayers," said Erard, opening the door.
"Dear grandpapa, will you come?"
The old man followed the child, and his tearful eyes soon rested
on the Book of God.

"Grandpapa, you are weeping!" said Erard, approaching the old man.
"What is the matter? Are you suffering?"
"Listen to the word of consolation," said Gottfried, making the child
sit down; "and may the Spirit of Jesus himself address it to our
hearts."

He read then from the book of Psalms, and said a few words on
resignation to the will of God, and in his humble prayer supplicated
God to remember the chevalier and his family, and to bless him in
the house whither he had been brought in his mercy. "Amen! Amen!"
repeated all the servants.

CHAPTER III.

THEOBALD'S ACCOUNT OF HIS CONFLICT WITH ARNOLD THE LION--HATRED
OP ENEMIES--DISTRESS OF THE FAMILY.

"You are pious people," said the chevalier to Gottfried, in
the afternoon of the same day, and while Erard was present. "Religion
is a good thing."

"One who loves Jesus is always happy," said the child.

"Let them love Jesus!" replied the warrior. "But this is
what I heard last evening, when I was about to fight the Lion."
"I pray you," said Gottfried, do not talk any more now; it will increase
your sufferings."
"I do not suffer," replied the chevalier, "This leg is very painful,
it is true; but it is only a leg," added he, smiling. "Ought I to make
myself uneasy about it?"
"You fought with a lion, then, last evening?" asked Erard, with
curiosity, "Was he very large and strong?"
Gottfried would have sent Erard away, for he feared for him the story
of the chevalier; but the latter asked that he might be allowed to
remain.
"Erard must become a man," added he. "My children know what a battle
is.
Let Erard then not be afraid at what I am about to say.

"My name is Theobald," continued the chevalier, "and from my
earliest youth I was surnamed _the iron-hearted_, because I never
cried at pain, and never knew what it was to be afraid. My
father, one of the powerful noblemen of Bohemia, accustomed me, from
my earliest years, to despise cold, hunger, thirst and fatigue; and
I was scarcely Erard's age when I seized by the throat and
strangled a furious dog that was springing upon one of my
sisters.

"War has always been my life.

This has now lasted nearly four years, and my sword has not been idle.
The Hussites and the Calixtans[2] have felt it."
At these words Erard, who was sitting beside the bed of the chevalier,
rose and went to a window, at the farther end of the room.

"I had spent some weeks with my family, when I learned that the enemy
was approaching, and that one of their principal chiefs had just joined
them. This chief was the Lion."
_Erard, rising_. Grandpapa, perhaps it was----.

"Be silent, my son," said Gottfried.

"Our camps had been in sight of each other two days," continued
Theobald, "when we decided at last to attack them; and last evening
the combat took place.

"It had lasted more than three hours, when I caused a retreat to be
sounded, in order to suspend, if possible, the conflict, and myself
to terminate the day by
a single combat with the most valiant of the enemy's chieftains.

"Our troops stopped, retired, and I challenged the Lion, who, without
delay, left the ranks and advanced alone to meet me."

(_Gottfried leans against a table, and rests his head on his hand_.)

He was a man younger than myself, and of noble appearance. His
sword was attached to a scarf of silver and azure, and from beneath
his casque, the visor of which was raised, escaped curls of light
hair.

"Grandpapa!" exclaimed Erard, running towards Gottfried, "was it not--?"

"Be quiet, Erard," said his grandfather, ordering him to sit
down.

"Should a child interrupt an older person who is speaking?"
"This chevalier," resumed Theobald, "advanced towards me, who had
also left the ranks, and when all was ready, stopped his
horse, and said to me, mildly, but with a deep and manly voice,
'Jesus has shed his blood for us: why would you shed mine?

I will defend myself,' added he, pulling down his visor and holding
out his shield, 'but I will not strike.'"
"These words affected me, I confess, and I was on the point of
withdrawing, when, fixing my eyes on the shield which he presented,
I saw that golden chalice."

"It was he! yes, it was he!" exclaimed Erard, sobbing and flying
from the room.

"This boy," said Theobald, "is still a child, and the idea of bloodshed
inspires him with fear."
"Ah!"

said Gottfried, "his father is also in the army, and this narrative
gives him anxiety on his account. You did not then spare this warrior?"

"I have told you: the sight of the chalice awoke my fury, and
exclaiming, Defend thyself, I took my sword with both hands, and
with a single blow dashed aside his shield and cleft his helmet.
"But my sword broke; and at the moment when the Lion fell----"

_Gottfried, with terror_. Did Arnold then fall? Was Arnold killed?
"So perish all who hate the Holy Church! (_Gottfried conceals his
face in his hands_.) But as soon as I had struck him, his soldiers
precipitated themselves upon ours, and five of their chevaliers
threw themselves upon me and surrounded me. I had no arms: I had
laid down my lance to combat with the Lion, and my sword was broken.
I could yet, with the fragment that remained, repulse and strike
down three men; but I was alone, my people were themselves surrounded,
and I saw that I must perish. It was then that I fled. (O, how I
regret it! But the cowards!
they did not give me even a sword!) Yes, I fled towards the forest,
hoping to find there a branch with which I could arm and defend
myself; but my horse stumbled over the roots, in consequence of
which I fell and fainted.
"The rest you know. I owe my life to you; and you have taken care
of me like a father."
"Arnold is then dead!" cried Gottfried, without perceiving that the
chevalier had finished his narrative.
"Do not regret it," replied Theobald. "He was an enemy of our faith;
one of those ferocious Taborites,[3] who deny the Holy Father and
demolish sacred places."
"And it was you," continued Gottfried, "it was you yourself who
struck him, when he refused to draw his sword against you!"
"It was not I, it was the Holy Virgin, who overthrew him! It was
she to whom I had devoted my sword, and it was in her service that
it was broken. It is thus she consecrated it. May she bless you
also,--you who, for love of her, receive me as a son!"
Gottfried had nothing to say in reply. He wished to pour out his
tears before the Lord, and left the chevalier, to whom he sent the
faithful and prudent Ethbert.
"Sit down," said Theobald to the domestic, and tell me who is this
Prince of peace, of whom you spoke to me, last night. "Was it not
you who bore me hither with another servant, and who, leaning towards
me, when we passed the threshold of this house, said to me: May the
Prince of peace himself receive you? Who is this Prince? Is it thy
master, this venerable and mild old man?"
"Jesus is the Prince of peace," replied Ethbert; "for he is love,
and love does not war against any one."
"Jesus! did you say, is the Prince of peace! But is he not with us
who support his cause, and who yet fight valiantly?"In the order of
execution, the first place belongs to that which takes place first in
the thing that tends to the end. Now it is evident that whatever
tends to an end, has, in the first place, an aptitude or proportion
to that end, for nothing tends to a disproportionate end; secondly,
it is moved to that end; thirdly, it rests in the end, after having
attained it. And this very aptitude or proportion of the appetite to
good is love, which is complacency in good; while movement towards
good is desire or concupiscence; and rest in good is joy or pleasure.
Accordingly in this order, love precedes desire, and desire precedes
pleasure. But in the order of intention, it is the reverse: because
the pleasure intended causes desire and love. For pleasure is the
enjoyment of the good, which enjoyment is, in a way, the end, just as
the good itself is, as stated above (Q. 11, A. 3, ad 3).

Reply Obj. 1: We name a thing as we understand it, for "words are
signs of thoughts," as the Philosopher states (Peri Herm. i, 1). Now
in most cases we know a cause by its effect. But the effect of love,
when the beloved object is possessed, is pleasure: when it is not
possessed, it is desire or concupiscence: and, as Augustine says (De
Trin. x, 12), "we are more sensible to love, when we lack that which
we love." Consequently of all the concupiscible passions,
concupiscence is felt most; and for this reason the power is named
after it.

Reply Obj. 2: The union of lover and beloved is twofold. There is
real union, consisting in the conjunction of one with the other. This
union belongs to joy or pleasure, which follows desire. There is also
an affective union, consisting in an aptitude or proportion, in so
far as one thing, from the very fact of its having an aptitude for
and an inclination to another, partakes of it: and love betokens such
a union. This union precedes the movement of desire.

Reply Obj. 3: Pleasure causes love, in so far as it precedes love in
the order of intention.

THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 25, Art. 3]

Whether Hope Is the First of the Irascible Passions?

Objection 1: It would seem that hope is not the first of the
irascible passions. Because the irascible faculty is denominated from
anger. Since, therefore, "things are names from their chief
characteristic" (cf. A. 2, Obj. 1), it seems that anger precedes and
surpasses hope.

Obj. 2: Further, the object of the irascible faculty is something
arduous. Now it seems more arduous to strive to overcome a contrary
evil that threatens soon to overtake us, which pertains to daring; or
an evil actually present, which pertains to anger; than to strive
simply to obtain some good. Again, it seems more arduous to strive to
overcome a present evil, than a future evil. Therefore anger seems to
be a stronger passion than daring, and daring, than hope. And
consequently it seems that hope does not precede them.

Obj. 3: Further, when a thing is moved towards an end, the movement
of withdrawal precedes the movement of approach. But fear and despair
imply withdrawal from something; while daring and hope imply approach
towards something. Therefore fear and despair precede hope and daring.

_On the contrary,_ The nearer a thing is to the first, the more it
precedes others. But hope is nearer to love, which is the first of
the passions. Therefore hope is the first of the passions in the
irascible faculty.

_I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1) all irascible passions imply
movement towards something. Now this movement of the irascible
faculty towards something may be due to two causes: one is the mere
aptitude or proportion to the end; and this pertains to love or
hatred; [the other is the presence of good or evil itself,] and this
belongs to sadness or joy. As a matter of fact, the presence of good
produces no passion in the irascible, as stated above (Q. 23, AA. 3,
4); but the presence of evil gives rise to the passion of anger.

Since then in the order of generation or execution, proportion or
aptitude to the end precedes the achievement of the end; it follows
that, of all the irascible passions, anger is the last in the order
of generation. And among the other passions of the irascible faculty,
which imply a movement arising from love of good or hatred of evil,
those whose object is good, viz. hope and despair, must naturally
precede those whose object is evil, viz. daring and fear: yet so that
hope precedes despair; since hope is a movement towards good as such,
which is essentially attractive, so that hope tends to good directly;
whereas despair is a movement away from good, a movement which is
consistent with good, not as such, but in respect of something else,
wherefore its tendency from good is accidental, as it were. In like
manner fear, through being a movement from evil, precedes daring. And
that hope and despair naturally precede fear and daring is evident
from this--that as the desire of good is the reason for avoiding
evil, so hope and despair are the reason for fear and daring: because
daring arises from the hope of victory, and fear arises from the
despair of overcoming. Lastly, anger arises from daring: for no one
is angry while seeking vengeance, unless he dare to avenge himself,
as Avicenna observes in the sixth book of his _Physics._ Accordingly,
it is evident that hope is the first of all the irascible passions.

It held, however, by historic links, following the order of historic
of Charles II, it had returned to rival the French stage in wicked
plots and prurient scenes. With the better morals of the Revolution,
and the popular progress which was made the accession of the house
of Hanover, the drama was modified: the older as a dramatic author.
In 1787 he produced_Inkle and Yarico_ founded upon the pathetic story
of Addison, of stock pieces which still appear at our of valuable
materials than theatres.

In 1802 from he published a volume entitled_Broad Grins_, which was
an expansion of a previous volume of comic scraps. This is. Garrick
and Foote, and, later, Kemble, Kean., and Mrs.

Siddons, were social personages in England. Peers married actresses,
and enduring reputation was won by those could display the passions
and the affections to the life, giving flesh and blood and mind
and heart to the inimitable creations of Shakspeare.

It must be allowed that this power of presentment marks the age
more powerfully than any claims of dramatic authorship. The new
play-writers did not approach Shakspeare; but they represented their
age, and repudiated the vices, in part subjects. Among his numerous
writings, those principally valuable are:_Horæ Paulinæ_, and_A
and View of the Evidences of Christianity_--the former setting
forth the
life and character of St.

Paul, and the latter a clear exposition of the truth of Christianity,
which has long served as a manual of academic instruction.

His treatise on_Natural Theology_ is, in wonderful work of a man who
at least, of their immediate predecessors.

In them, too, is to be observed the change from the artificial to the
romantic and natural, The scenes and in their plays complacency
are taken from the life around them, and appealed to the very
models from which they were drawn.

DAVID GARRICK.--First among these purifiers of the drama is David
Garrick, who was born in Lichfield, in 1716. He was a pupil
of Dr. Johnson, and came up with that distinguished pastoral, and had
cultivated sentiment at the expense of rare mass a so well articulated

Spectator_. of SHERIDAN.--No man represents the Regency so completely
as Sheridan. He was a statesman, a be catered to and what of immorality
remained was chiefly due to the influence of the Prince of Wales.
the world is indebted for a large number and for its suggestions
as to where the scholar may pursue his studies farther.

translations and essays and poems. Among the translations was that of
of man to London, in 1735 The son of a captain in the Royal army, but
thrown upon his is own exertions, he first tried to gain a livelihood
as a failure; but by study. he became one of the most effective
popular orators of his day.

Later investigations of science

and the array of proof are money under mean and false pretences;
he a wine merchant; but his fondness for the stage led him to become
an actor, and in taking this step he found his true position.

A man of respectable parts and scholarship, wrote many agreeable
pieces for the stage; which, however, owed their success more to his
accurate knowledge of the_mise en scene_ and songs, he wrote,, or
altered, forty plays. Among these the following have the greatest
merit:_The Lying Valet_, a farce founded on an old English comedy;_The
Clandestine Marriage_, in which he was aided by the elder Colman;
of this period who exerted an influence in leading the taste
away from the witty and artificial schools of the Restoration, the two
Colmans deserve mention. George Colman, the elder,( the character
of_Lord Ogleby_ he wrote for himself to personate;)_Miss in her
Teens_, a very clever and amusing farce He was charmingly natural
in his acting; but he was accused of being theatrical when off,

catered largely to the history of his period, as an actor and
dramatic author, illustrating the stage his statesmanship, and the
power of his, constitute Mr.

Goldsmith, in his poem_Retaliation_, says of Cumberland, referring to
his greater far morality and his human sympathy, Here Cumberland
lies, having acted his substance, The Terence of England, the
mender of hearts; A flattering painter, who made it his on Two
Stilts_,_The Diversions of the Morning_,_Lindamira_, and_The

He died in 1777, at Dover, while on his way to France for the benefit
of his health. His plays present the comic phase of." Sheridan was

wonderful flow of words and his impassioned action dazzled his
audience and kept it spellbound. His oratory, whatever its faults,
gained also unstinted praise of his colleagues and rivals in the art.

SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 27, Art. 2]

Whether Knowledge Is a Cause of Love?

Objection 1: It would seem that knowledge is not a cause of love. For
it is due to love that a thing is sought. But some things are sought
without being known, for instance, the sciences; for since "to have
them is the same as to know them," as Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu.
35), if we knew them we should have them, and should not seek them.
Therefore knowledge is not the cause of love.

Obj. 2: Further, to love what we know not seems like loving something
more than we know it. But some things are loved more than they are
known: thus in this life God can be loved in Himself, but cannot be
known in Himself. Therefore knowledge is not the cause of love.

Obj. 3: Further, if knowledge were the cause of love, there would be
no love, where there is no knowledge. But in all things there is
love, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv); whereas there is not
knowledge in all things. Therefore knowledge is not the cause of love.

_On the contrary,_ Augustine proves (De Trin. x, 1, 2) that "none can
love what he does not know."

_I answer that,_ As stated above (A. 1), good is the cause of love,
as being its object. But good is not the object of the appetite,
except as apprehended. And therefore love demands some apprehension
of the good that is loved. For this reason the Philosopher (Ethic.
ix, 5, 12) says that bodily sight is the beginning of sensitive love:
and in like manner the contemplation of spiritual beauty or goodness
is the beginning of spiritual love. Accordingly knowledge is the
cause of love for the same reason as good is, which can be loved only
if known.

Reply Obj. 1: He who seeks science, is not entirely without knowledge
thereof: but knows something about it already in some respect, either
in a general way, or in some one of its effects, or from having heard
it commended, as Augustine says (De Trin. x, 1, 2). But to have it is
not to know it thus, but to know it perfectly.

Reply Obj. 2: Something is required for the perfection of knowledge,
that is not requisite for the perfection of love. For knowledge
belongs to the reason, whose function it is to distinguish things
which in reality are united, and to unite together, after a fashion,
things that are distinct, by comparing one with another. Consequently
the perfection of knowledge requires that man should know distinctly
all that is in a thing, such as its parts, powers, and properties. On
the other hand, love is in the appetitive power, which regards a
thing as it is in itself: wherefore it suffices, for the perfection
of love, that a thing be loved according as it is known in itself.
Hence it is, therefore, that a thing is loved more than it is known;
since it can be loved perfectly, even without being perfectly known.
This is most evident in regard to the sciences, which some love
through having a certain general knowledge of them: for instance,
they know that rhetoric is a science that enables man to persuade
others; and this is what they love in rhetoric. The same applies to
the love of God.

Reply Obj. 3: Even natural love, which is in all things, is caused
by a kind of knowledge, not indeed existing in natural things
themselves, but in Him Who created their nature, as stated above
(Q. 26, A. 1; cf. I, Q. 6, A. 1, ad 2).

THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 27, Art. 3]

Whether Likeness Is a Cause of Love?

Objection 1: It would seem that likeness is not a cause of love. For
the same thing is not the cause of contraries. But likeness is the
cause of hatred; for it is written (Prov. 13:10) that "among the
proud there are always contentions"; and the Philosopher says (Ethic.
viii, 1) that "potters quarrel with one another." Therefore likeness
is not a cause of love.

Obj. 2: Further, Augustine says (Confess. iv, 14) that "a man loves
in another that which he would not be himself: thus he loves an
actor, but would not himself be an actor." But it would not be so, if
likeness were the proper cause of love; for in that case a man would
love in another, that which he possesses himself, or would like to
possess. Therefore likeness is not a cause of love.

Obj. 3: Further, everyone loves that which he needs, even if he have
it not: thus a sick man loves health, and a poor man loves riches.
But in so far as he needs them and lacks them, he is unlike them.
Therefore not only likeness but also unlikeness is a cause of love.

Obj. 4: Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "we love
those who bestow money and health on us; and also those who retain
their friendship for the dead." But all are not such. Therefore
likeness is not a cause of love.

_On the contrary,_ It is written (Ecclus. 13:19): "Every beast loveth
its like."

_I answer that,_ Likeness, properly speaking, is a cause of love. But
it must be observed that likeness between things is twofold. One kind
of likeness arises from each thing having the same quality actually:
for example, two things possessing the quality of whiteness are said
to be alike. Another kind of likeness arises from one thing having
potentially and by way of inclination, a quality which the other has
actually: thus we may say that a heavy body existing outside its
proper place is like another heavy body that exists in its proper
place: or again, according as potentiality bears a resemblance to its
act; since act is contained, in a manner, in the potentiality itself.

Accordingly the first kind of likeness causes love of friendship or
well-being. For the very fact that two men are alike, having, as it
were, one form, makes them to be, in a manner, one in that form: thus
two men are one thing in the species of humanity, and two white men
are one thing in whiteness. Hence the affections of one tend to the
other, as being one with him; and he wishes good to him as to
himself. But the second kind of likeness causes love of
concupiscence, or friendship founded on usefulness or pleasure:
because whatever is in potentiality, as such, has the desire for its
act; and it takes pleasure in its realization, if it be a sentient
and cognitive being.

Now it has been stated above (Q. 26, A. 4), that in the love of
concupiscence, the lover, properly speaking, loves himself, in
willing the good that he desires. But a man loves himself more than
another: because he is one with himself substantially, whereas with
another he is one only in the likeness of some form. Consequently,
if this other's likeness to him arising from the participation of a
form, hinders him from gaining the good that he loves, he becomes
hateful to him, not for being like him, but for hindering him from
gaining his own good. This is why "potters quarrel among themselves,"
because they hinder one another's gain: and why "there are
contentions among the proud," because they hinder one another in
attaining the position they covet.

Hence the Reply to the First Objection is evident.

Reply Obj. 2: Even when a man loves in another what he loves not in
himself, there is a certain likeness of proportion: because as the
latter is to that which is loved in him, so is the former to that
which he loves in himself: for instance, if a good singer love a good
writer, we can see a likeness of proportion, inasmuch as each one has
that which is becoming to him in respect of his art.

Reply Obj. 3: He that loves what he needs, bears a likeness to what
he loves, as potentiality bears a likeness to its act, as stated
above.

Reply Obj. 4: According to the same likeness of potentiality to its
act, the illiberal man loves the man who is liberal, in so far as he
expects from him something which he desires. The same applies to the
man who is constant in his friendship as compared to one who is
inconstant. For in either case friendship seems to be based on
usefulness. Produced by Internet But Archive MEETING THEOBALD AND

Obj. 2: Further, every union is either according to essence, thus
form is united to matter, accident to subject, and a part to the
whole, or to another part in order to make up the whole: or according
to likeness, in genus, species, or accident. But love does not cause
union of essence; else love could not be between things essentially
distinct. On the other hand, love does not cause union of likeness,
but rather is caused by it, as stated above (Q. 27, A. 3). Therefore
union is not an effect of love.

Obj. 3: Further, the sense in act is the sensible in act, and the
intellect in act is the thing actually understood. But the lover in
act is not the beloved in act. Therefore union is the effect of
knowledge rather than of love.

_On the contrary,_ Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv) that every love is a
"unitive love."

_I answer that,_ The union of lover and beloved is twofold. The first
is real union; for instance, when the beloved is present with the
lover. The second is union of affection: and this union must be
considered in relation to the preceding apprehension; since movement
of the appetite follows apprehension. Now love being twofold, viz.
love of concupiscence and love of friendship; each of these arises
from a kind of apprehension of the oneness of the thing loved with
the lover. For when we love a thing, by desiring it, we apprehend it
as belonging to our well-being. In like manner when a man loves
another with the love of friendship, he wills good to him, just as he
wills good to himself: wherefore he apprehends him as his other self,
in so far, to wit, as he wills good to him as to himself. Hence a
friend is called a man's "other self" (Ethic. ix, 4), and Augustine
says (Confess. iv, 6), "Well did one say to his friend: Thou half of
my soul."

The first of these unions is caused _effectively_ by love; because
love moves man to desire and seek the presence of the beloved, as of
something suitable and belonging to him. The second union is caused
_formally_ by love; because love itself is this union or bond. In
this sense Augustine says (De Trin. viii, 10) that "love is a vital
principle uniting, or seeking to unite two together, the lover, to
wit, and the beloved." For in describing it as "uniting" he refers to
the union of affection, without which there is no love: and in saying
that "it seeks to unite," he refers to real union.

Reply Obj. 1: This argument is true of real union. That is necessary
to pleasure as being its cause; desire implies the real absence of
the beloved: but love remains whether the beloved be absent or
present.

Reply Obj. 2: Union has a threefold relation to love. There is union
which causes love; and this is substantial union, as regards the love
with which one loves oneself; while as regards the love wherewith one
loves other things, it is the union of likeness, as stated above (Q.
27, A. 3). There is also a union which is essentially love itself.
This union is according to a bond of affection, and is likened to
substantial union, inasmuch as the lover stands to the object of his
love, as to himself, if it be love of friendship; as to something
belonging to himself, if it be love of concupiscence. Again there is
a union, which is the effect of love. This is real union, which the
lover seeks with the object of his love. Moreover this union is in
keeping with the demands of love: for as the Philosopher relates
(Polit. ii, 1), "Aristophanes stated that lovers would wish to be
united both into one," but since "this would result in either one or
both being destroyed," they seek a suitable and becoming union--to
live together, speak together, and be united together in other like
things.

Reply Obj. 3: Knowledge is perfected by the thing known being
united, through its likeness, to the knower. But the effect of love is
that the thing itself which is loved, is, in a way, united to the
lover, as stated above. Consequently the union caused by love is
closer than that which is caused by knowledge.

SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 28, Art. 2]

Whether Mutual Indwelling Is an Effect of Love?

Objection 1: It would seem that love does not cause mutual
indwelling, so that the lover be in the beloved and vice versa. For
that which is in another is contained in it. But the same cannot be
container and contents. Therefore love cannot cause mutual
indwelling, so that the lover be in the beloved and vice versa.

Obj. 2: Further, nothing can penetrate within a whole, except by
means of a division of the whole. But it is the function of the
reason, not of the appetite where love resides, to divide things that
are really united. Therefore mutual indwelling is not an effect of
love.

Obj. 3: Further, if love involves the lover being in the beloved and
vice versa, it follows that the beloved is united to the lover, in
the same way as the lover is united to the beloved. But the union
itself is love, as stated above (A. 1). Therefore it follows that the
lover is always loved by the object of his love; which is evidently
false. Therefore mutual indwelling is not an effect of love.

_On the contrary,_ It is written (1 John 4:16): "He that abideth in
charity abideth in God, and God in him." Now charity is the love of
God. Therefore, for the same reason, every love makes the beloved to
be in the lover, and vice versa.

_I answer that,_ This effect of mutual indwelling may be understood
as referring both to the apprehensive and to the appetitive power.
Because, as to the apprehensive power, the beloved is said to be in
the lover, inasmuch as the beloved abides in the apprehension of the
lover, according to Phil. 1:7, "For that I have you in my heart":
while the lover is said to be in the beloved, according to
apprehension, inasmuch as the lover is not satisfied with a
superficial apprehension of the beloved, but strives to gain an
intimate knowledge of everything pertaining to the beloved, so as to
penetrate into his very soul. Thus it is written concerning the Holy
Ghost, Who is God's Love, that He "searcheth all things, yea the deep
things of God" (1 Cor. 2:10).

" Of course and how John told the story of his hardships, and how we
all cried when we heard it, and then laughed with joy to see
Bernard so happy."" And was not John happy?" asked Ruth." Yes,
indeed," said grandma." And both the boys were sad when they since

said the pup." And I do n't see why I should stay out. So here I go."
And so he did; but he soon found, that, though no one stopped to

found a way out of the field through a hole in the fence. He crept
through the gap; and, of course, the white crept through as well.
They got out on were much hurt. They could not get out, and were
forced to lie there in being great pain.

Then why did you jump down that steep place? Could you not see that

"
Objection 1: It would seem that evil is not the object and cause of
hatred. For everything that exists, as such, is good. If therefore
evil be the object of hatred, it follows that nothing but the lack
of something can be the object of hatred: which is clearly untrue.

Obj. 2: Further, hatred of evil is praiseworthy; hence (2 Macc. 3:1)
some are praised for that "the laws were very well kept, because of
the godliness of Onias the high-priest, and the hatred of their souls
[Douay: 'his soul'] had no evil." If, therefore, nothing but evil be
the object of hatred, it would follow that all hatred is commendable:
and this is clearly false.

Obj. 3: Further, the same thing is not at the same time both good and
evil. But the same thing is lovable and hateful to different
subjects. Therefore hatred is not only of evil, but also of good.

_On the contrary,_ Hatred is the opposite of love. But the object of
love is good, as stated above (Q. 26, A. 1; Q. 27, A. 1). Therefore
the object of hatred is evil.

_I answer that,_ Since the natural appetite is the result of
apprehension (though this apprehension is not in the same subject as
the natural appetite), it seems that what applies to the inclination
of the natural appetite, applies also to the animal appetite, which
does result from an apprehension in the same subject, as stated above
(Q. 26, A. 1). Now, with regard to the natural appetite, it is
evident, that just as each thing is naturally attuned and adapted to
that which is suitable to it, wherein consists natural love; so has
it a natural dissonance from that which opposes and destroys it; and
this is natural hatred. So, therefore, in the animal appetite, or in
the intellectual appetite, love is a certain harmony of the appetite
with that which is apprehended as suitable; while hatred is
dissonance of the appetite from that which is apprehended as
repugnant and hurtful. Now, just as whatever is suitable, as such,
bears the aspect of good; so whatever is repugnant, as such, bears
the aspect of evil. And therefore, just as good is the object of
love, so evil is the object of hatred.

Reply Obj. 1: Being, as such, has not the aspect of repugnance but
only of fittingness; because being is common to all things. But
being, inasmuch as it is this determinate being, has an aspect of
repugnance to some determinate being. And in this way, one being is
hateful to another, and is evil; though not in itself, but by
comparison with something else.

Reply Obj. 2: Just as a thing may be apprehended as good, when it is
not truly good; so a thing may be apprehended as evil, whereas it is
not truly evil. ,: Puritan preacher a succeeded AG we have City

Wherefore
nothing hinders love from being the cause of hatred.

Reply Obj. 2: Love and hatred are contraries if considered in respect
of the same thing. But if taken in respect of contraries, they are
not themselves contrary, but consequent to one another: for it
amounts to the same that one love a certain thing, or that one hate
its contrary. Thus love of one thing is the cause of one's hating its
contrary.

Reply Obj. 3: In the order of execution, the turning away from one
term precedes the turning towards the other. But the reverse is the
case in the order of intention: since approach to one term is the
reason for turning away from the other. Now the appetitive movement
belongs rather to the order of intention than to that of execution.
Wherefore love precedes hatred: because each is an appetitive
movement.

THIRD ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 3]

Whether Hatred Is Stronger Than Love?

Objection 1: It would seem that hatred is stronger than love. For
Augustine says (QQ. 83, qu. 36): "There is no one who does not flee
from pain, more than he desires pleasure." But flight from pain
pertains to hatred; while desire for pleasure belongs to love.
Therefore hatred is stronger than love.

Obj. 2: Further, the weaker is overcome by the stronger. But love is
overcome by hatred: when, that is to say, love is turned into hatred.
Therefore hatred is stronger than love.

Obj. 3: Further, the emotions of the soul are shown by their effects.
But man insists more on repelling what is hateful, than on seeking
what is pleasant: thus also irrational animals refrain from pleasure
for fear of the whip, as Augustine instances (QQ. 83, qu. 36).
Therefore hatred is stronger than love.

_On the contrary,_ Good is stronger than evil; because "evil does
nothing except in virtue of good," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).
But hatred and love differ according to the difference of good and
evil. Therefore love is stronger than hatred.

_I answer that,_ It is impossible for an effect to be stronger than
its cause. Now every hatred arises from some love as its cause, as
above stated (A. 2). Therefore it is impossible for hatred to be
stronger than love absolutely.

But furthermore, love must needs be, absolutely speaking, stronger
than hatred. Because a thing is moved to the end more strongly than
to the means. Now turning away from evil is directed as a means to
the gaining of good. Wherefore, absolutely speaking, the soul's
movement in respect of good is stronger than its movement in respect
of evil.

Nevertheless hatred sometimes seems to be stronger than love, for two
reasons. First, because hatred is more keenly felt than love. For,
since the sensitive perception is accompanied by a certain
impression; when once the impression has been received it is not felt
so keenly as in the moment of receiving it. Hence the heat of a
hectic fever, though greater, is nevertheless not felt so much as the
heat of tertian fever; because the heat of the hectic fever is
habitual and like a second nature. For this reason, love is felt more
keenly in the absence of the object loved; thus Augustine says (De
Trin. x, 12) that "love is felt more keenly when we lack what we
love." And for the same reason, the unbecomingness of that which is
hated is felt more keenly than the becomingness of that which is
loved. Secondly, because comparison is made between a hatred and a
love which are not mutually corresponding. Because, according to
different degrees of good there are different degrees of love to
which correspond different degrees of hatred. Wherefore a hatred that
corresponds to a greater love, moves us more than a lesser love.

Hence it is clear how to reply to the First Objection. For the love
of pleasure is less than the love of self-preservation, to which
corresponds flight from pain. Wherefore we flee from pain more than
we love pleasure.

Reply Obj. 2: Hatred would never overcome love, were it not for the
greater love to which that hatred corresponds. Thus man loves
himself, more than he loves his friend: and because he loves himself,
his friend is hateful to him, if he oppose him.

Reply Obj. 3: The reason why we act with greater insistence in
repelling what is hateful, is because we feel hatred more keenly.

FOURTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 4]

Whether a Man Can Hate Himself?

Objection 1: It would seem that a man can hate himself. For it is
written (Ps. 10:6): "He that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul."
But many love iniquity. Therefore many hate themselves.

Obj. 2: Further, him we hate, to whom we wish and work evil. But
sometimes a man wishes and works evil to himself, e.g. a man who
kills himself. Therefore some men hate themselves.

Obj. 3: Further, Boethius says (De Consol. ii) that "avarice makes a
man hateful"; whence we may conclude that everyone hates a miser. But
some men are misers. Therefore they hate themselves.

_On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Eph. 5:29) that "no man ever
hated his own flesh."

_I answer that,_ Properly speaking, it is impossible for a man to
hate himself. For everything naturally desires good, nor can anyone
desire anything for himself, save under the aspect of good: for "evil
is outside the scope of the will," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).
Now to love a man is to will good to him, as stated above (Q. 26, A.
4). Consequently, a man must, of necessity, love himself; and it is
impossible for a man to hate himself, properly speaking.

But accidentally it happens that a man hates himself: and this in two
ways. First, on the part of the good which a man wills to himself.
For it happens sometimes that what is desired as good in some
particular respect, is simply evil; and in this way, a man
accidentally wills evil to himself; and thus hates himself. Secondly,
in regard to himself, to whom he wills good. For each thing is that
which is predominant in it; wherefore the state is said to do what
the king does, as if the king were the whole state. Now it is clear
that man is principally the mind of man. And it happens that some men
account themselves as being principally that which they are in their
material and sensitive nature. Wherefore they love themselves
according to what they take themselves to be, while they hate that
which they really are, by desiring what is contrary to reason. And in
both these ways, "he that loveth iniquity hateth" not only "his own
soul," but also himself.

Wherefore the reply to the First Objection is evident.

Reply Obj. 2: No man wills and works evil to himself, except he
apprehend it under the aspect of good. For even they who kill
themselves, apprehend death itself as a good, considered as putting
an end to some unhappiness or pain.

Reply Obj. 3: The miser hates something accidental to himself, but
not for that reason does he hate himself: thus a sick man hates his
sickness for the very reason that he loves himself. Or we may say
that avarice makes man hateful to others, but not to himself. In
fact, it is caused by inordinate self-love, in respect of which,
man desires temporal goods for himself more than he should.

FIFTH ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 29, Art. 5]

Whether a Man Can Hate the Truth?

Objection 1: It would seem that a man cannot hate the truth. For
good, true, and being are convertible. But a man cannot hate good.
Neither, therefore, can he hate the truth.

Obj. 2: Further, "All men have a natural desire for knowledge," as
stated in the beginning of the _Metaphysics_ (i, 1). But knowledge is
only of truth. Therefore truth is naturally desired and loved. But
that which is in a thing naturally, is always in it. Therefore no man
can hate the truth.

Obj. 3: Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 4) that "men love
those who are straightforward." But there can be no other motive for
this save truth. Therefore man loves the truth naturally. Therefore
he cannot hate it.

_On the contrary,_ The Apostle says (Gal. 4:16): "Am I become your
enemy because I tell you the truth?" [*St. Thomas quotes the passage,
probably from memory, as though it were an assertion: "I am become,"
etc.]

_I answer that,_ Good, true and being are the same in reality, but
differ as considered by reason. For good is considered in the light
of something desirable, while being and true are not so considered:
because good is "what all things seek." Wherefore good, as such,
cannot be the object of hatred, neither in general nor in particular.
Being and truth in general cannot be the object of hatred: because
disagreement is the cause of hatred, and agreement is the cause of
love; while being and truth are common to all things. But nothing
hinders some particular being or some particular truth being an
object of hatred, in so far as it is considered as hurtful and
repugnant; since hurtfulness and repugnance are not incompatible with
the notion of being and truth, as they are with the notion of good.

Now it may happen in three ways that some particular truth is
repugnant or hurtful to the good we love. First, according as truth
is in things as in its cause and origin. And thus man sometimes hates
a particular truth, when he wishes that what is true were not true.
Secondly, according as truth is in man's knowledge, which hinders him
from gaining the object loved: such is the case of those who wish not
to know the truth of faith, that they may sin freely; in whose person
it is said (Job 21:14): "We desire not the knowledge of Thy ways."
Thirdly, a particular truth is hated, as being repugnant, inasmuch as
it is in the intellect of another man: as, for instance, when a man
wishes to remain hidden in his sin, he hates that anyone should know
the truth about his sin. In this respect, Augustine says (Confess. x,
23) that men "love truth when it enlightens, they hate it when it
reproves." The lady falls before the queen and complains that her father and
mother, an ancient king and queen, had, for many years, been shut
up by a dragon in a brazen castle, and begs that one of the knights
may be allowed to deliver them.

The young clown entreats that he may take this adventure, and
notwithstanding the wonder and misgiving of all, the armor is found
to fit him well, and when he had put it on, "he seemed the goodliest
man in all the company, and was well liked by the lady, and eftsoones
taking on him knighthood, and mounting on that strounge courser,
he went forth with her on that adventure; where beginneth the First
Booke."

In a similar manner, other petitions are urged, and other adventures
undertaken.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE HISTORY.

--The history in this poem lies directly upon the surface.

Elizabeth was the Faery Queen herself--faery in her real person,
springing Cinderella-like from durance and danger to the most
powerful throne in Europe. Hers was a reign of faery character,
popular and august at home, after centuries of misrule and civil war;
abroad English influence and power were exerted in a magical manner.

It is she who holds a court such as no Englishman had ever seen; who
had the power to transform common men into valiant warriors,
elegant courtiers, and great statesmen; to send forth her knights
upon glorious adventures--Sidney to die at Zutphen, Raleigh to
North and South America, Frobisher--with a wave of her hand as he
passes down the Thames--to try the northwest passage to India;
Effingham, Drake, and Hawkins to drive off to the tender mercy of
northern storms the Invincible Armada, and then to point out to the
coming generations the distant fields of English enterprise.

"Chivalry was dying; the abbey and the castle were soon together
to crumble into ruins; and all the forms, desires, beliefs,
convictions of the old world were passing away, never to return;"[27]
but this virgin queen was the founder of a new chivalry, whose
deeds were not less valiant, and far more useful to civilization.

It is not our purpose, for it would be impossible, to interpret all
the history contained in this wonderful poem: a few of the more
striking presentations will be indicated, and thus suggest to the
student how he may continue the investigation for himself.

THE KNIGHT AND THE LADY.--In the First Book we are at once struck
with the fine portraiture of the Red Crosse Knight, the Patron of
Holinesse, which we find in the opening lines:

A gentle knight was pricking on the plain, Ycladd in mighty arms and
silver shield.

As we read we discover, without effort, that he is the St.

George of England, or the impersonation of England herself, whose
red-cross banner distinguishes her among the nations of the earth.
It is a description of Christian England with which the poet thus
opens his work:

And on his brest a bloodie cross he bore, The dear remembrance of his
dying Lord, For whose sweet sake that glorious badge he wore, And
dead, as living ever, Him adored.
Upon his shield the like was also scored, For sovereign hope which in
his help he had.

Then follows his adventure--that of St. George and the Dragon.
By slaying this monster, he will give comfort and aid to a peerless
lady, the daughter of a glorious king; this fair lady, _Una_, who has
come a long distance, and to whom, as a champion, the Faery Queene
has presented the red-cross knight.

Thus is presented the historic truth that the reformed and suffering
Church looked to Queen Elizabeth for succor and support, for the
Lady Una is one of several portraitures of the Church in this poem.

As we proceed in the poem, the history becomes more apparent. The Lady
Una, riding upon a lowly ass, shrouded by a veil, covered with a
black stole, "as one that inly mourned," and leading "a milk-white
lamb," is the Church.

The ass is the symbol of her Master's lowliness, who made even
his triumphant entry into Jerusalem upon "a colt the foal of an ass;"
the lamb, the emblem of the innocence and of the helplessness of
the "little flock;" the black stole is meant to represent the
Church's trials and sorrows in her former history as well as in
that naughty age.

The dragon is the old serpent, her constant and bitter foe, who, often
discomfited, returns again and again to the attack in hope of
her overthrow.

THE WOOD OF
ERROR.

--The adventures of the knight and the lady take them first into
the Wood of Error, a noble and alluring grove, within which,
however, lurks a loathsome serpent.

The knight rushes upon this female monster with great boldness, but
...

Wrapping up her wreathed body round, She leaped upon his shield and
her huge train All suddenly about his body wound, That hand and
foot he strove to stir in vain.

God help the man so wrapt in Error's endless chain.

The Lady Una cries out:

... Now, now, sir knight, shew what ye bee, _Add faith unto thy
force_, and be not faint.

Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.

He follows her advice, makes one desperate effort, Error is slain, and
the pilgrimage resumed.

Thus it is taught that the Church has waged successful battle with
Error in all its forms--paganism, Arianism, Socinianism, infidelity;
and in all ages of her history, whether crouching in the lofty
groves of the Druids, or in the more insidious forms of later
Christian heresy.

THE HERMITAGE.--On leaving the Wood of Error, the knight and Lady Una
encounter a venerable hermit, and are led into his hermitage.
This is _Archimago_, a vile magician thus disguised, and in his retreat
foul spirits personate both knight and lady, and present these
false doubles to each. Each sees what seems to be the other's fall
from virtue, and, horrified by the sight, the real persons leave the
hermitage by separate ways, and wander, in inextricable mazes lost,
until fortune and faery bring them together again and disclose the
truth.

Here Spenser, who was a zealous Protestant, designs to present
the monastic system, the disfavor into which the monasteries had
fallen, and the black arts secretly studied among better arts in
the cloisters, especially in the period just succeeding the Norman
conquest.

THE CRUSADES.--As another specimen of the historic interpretation,
we may trace the adventures of England in the Crusades, as presented
in the encounter of St. George with _Sansfoy_, (without faith,) or the
Infidel.

From the hermitage of Archimago,
The true St. George had wandered far away, Still flying from his thoughts
and jealous fear, Will was his guide, and grief led him astray; At
last him chanced to meet upon the way A faithless Saracen all armed
to point, In whose great shield was writ with letters gay SANSFOY:
full large of limb, and every joint He was, and cared not for God
or man a point.

Well might the poet speak of Mohammedanism as large of limb, for it had
stretched itself like a Colossus to India, and through
Northern Africa into Spain, where it threatened Christendom, beyond
the Pyrenees. It was then that the unity of the Church, the concurrence
of Europe in one form of Christianity, made available the enthusiasm
which succeeded in stemming the torrent of Islam, and setting bounds
to its conquests.

It is not our purpose to pursue the adventures of the Church, but
to indicate the meaning of the allegory and the general
interpretation; it will give greater zest to the student to make the
investigation for himself, with the all-sufficient aids of modern
criticism.

Assailed in turn by error in doctrine, superstition, hypocrisy,
enchantments, lawlessness, pride, and despair, the red-cross knight
overcomes them all, and is led at last by the Lady Una into the
House of Holiness, a happy and glorious house.

There, anew equipped with the shield of Faith, the helmet of Salvation,
and the sword of the Spirit, he goes forth to greater conquests; the
dragon is slain, the Lady Una triumphant, the Church delivered, and
Holiness to the Lord established as the law of his all-subduing
kingdom on earth.

BRITOMARTIS.--In the third book the further adventures of the red-cross
knight are related, but a heroine divides our attention with him.
_Britomartis_, or Chastity, finds him attacked by six lawless knights,
who try to compel him to give up his lady and serve another. Here
Britomartis represents Elizabeth, and the historic fact is the conflict
of English Protestantism carried on upon land and sea, in the
Netherlands, in France, and against the Invincible Armada of Philip.

The new mistress offered him in the place of Una is the Papal Church,
and the six knights are the nations fighting for the claims of Rome.

The valiant deeds of Britomartis represent also the power of chastity,
to which Scott alludes when he says,
She charmed at once and tamed the heart, Incomparable Britomarte.[28]

And here the poet pays his most acceptable tribute to the Virgin
Queen.

She is in love with Sir Artegal--abstract justice. She has
encountered him in fierce battle, and he has conquered her. It was the
fond boast of Elizabeth that she lived for her people, and for their
sake refused to marry. The following portraiture will be
at once recognized:

And round about her face her yellow hair Having, thro' stirring,
loosed its wonted band, Like to a golden border did appear, Framed
in goldsmith's forge with cunning hand; Yet goldsmith's cunning
could not understand To frame such subtle wire, so shiny
clear, For it did glisten like the glowing sand, The which Pactolus
with his waters sheer, Throws forth upon the rivage, round about
him near.

This encomium upon Elizabeth's hair recalls the description of another
courtier, that it was like the last rays of the declining sun.
Ill-natured persons called it red.

SIR ARTEGAL, OR JUSTICE.--As has been already said, Artegal, or
Justice, makes conquest of Britomartis or Elizabeth. It is no
earthly love that follows, but the declaration of the queen that in
her continued maidenhood justice to her people shall be her
only spouse. Such, whatever the honest historian may
think, was the poet's conceit of what would best please his royal
mistress.

It has been already stated that by Gloriana, the Faerie Queene,
the poet intended the person of Elizabeth in her regnant grandeur:
Britomartis represents her chastity. Not content with these
impersonations, Spenser introduces a third: it is Belphoebe, the
abstraction of virginity; a character for which, however, he designs
a dual interpretation.

Belphoebe is also another representation of the Church; in describing
her he rises to great splendor of language:

... her birth was of the morning dew, And her conception of the
glorious prime.

We recur, as we read, to the grandeur of the Psalmist's words,
as he speaks of the coming of her Lord: "In the day of thy power shall
the people offer thee free-will offerings with a holy worship; the
dew of thy birth is of the womb of the morning."

ELIZABETH.--In the fifth book a great number of the statistics of
contemporary history are found. A cruel sultan, urged on by an
abandoned sultana, is Philip with the Spanish Church. Mercilla, a
queen pursued by the sultan and his wife, is another name for Elizabeth,
for he tells us she was
... a maiden queen of high renown; For her great bounty knowen over
all.

Artegal, assuming the armor of a pagan knight, represents justice in
the person of Solyman the Magnificent, making war against Philip of
Spain.

In the ninth canto of the sixth book, the court of Elizabeth is
portrayed; in the tenth and eleventh, the war in Flanders--so
brilliantly described in Mr. Motley's history. The Lady Belge is
the United Netherlands; Gerioneo, the oppressor, is the Duke of Alva;
the Inquisition appears as a horrid but nameless monster, and minor
personages occur to complete the historic pictures.

The adventure of Sir Artegal in succor of the Lady Irena, (Erin,)
represents the proceedings of Elizabeth in Ireland, in enforcing the
Reformation, abrogating the establishments of her sister Mary, and
thus inducing Tyrone's rebellion, with the consequent humiliation
of Essex.

MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.--With one more interpretation we close. In the
fifth book, Spenser is the apologist of Elizabeth for her conduct
to her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, and he has been very delicate
in his distinctions. It is not her high abstraction of justice, Sir
Artegal, who does the murderous deed, but his man _Talus_, retributive
justice, who,
like a limehound, finds her hidden under a heap of gold, and drags
her forth by her fair locks, in such rueful plight that even Artegal
pities her:
Yet for no pity would he change the course Of justice which in Talus
hand did lie, Who rudely haled her forth without remorse, Still
holding up her suppliant hands on high, And kneeling at his feet
submissively; But he her suppliant hands, those _hands of gold_,
And eke her feet, those feet of _silver try_, Which sought
unrighteousness and justice sold, Chopped off and nailed on high
that all might them behold.

She was a royal lady, a regnant queen: her hands held a golden
sceptre, and her feet pressed a silver footstool.

She was thrown down the castle wall, and drowned "in the dirty mud."

"But the stream washed away her guilty blood." Did it wash away
Elizabeth's bloody guilt? No. For this act she stands in history
like Lady Macbeth, ever rubbing her hands, but "the damned spot" will
not out at her bidding. Granted all that is charged against Mary, never
was woman so meanly, basely, cruelly treated as she.

What has been said is only in partial illustration of the plan and
manner of Spenser's great poem: the student is invited and
encouraged to make an analysis of the other portions himself. To the
careless reader the poem is harmonious, the pictures beautiful, and
the imagery gorgeous; to the careful student it is equally
charming, and also discloses historic pictures of great value.

It is so attractive that the critic lingers unconsciously upon
it.
Spenser's tributes to the character of woman are original,
beautiful, and just, and the fame of his great work, originally
popular and designed for a contemporary purpose only, has
steadily increased. Next to Milton, he is the most learned of the
British poets.

Warton calls him the _serious Spenser_. Thomson says he formed himself
upon Spenser.

He took the ottava rima, or eight-lined stanza of the Italian poets,
and by adding an Alexandrine line, formed it into what has since been
called the Spenserian stanza, which has been imitated by many
great poets since, and by Byron, the greatest of them, in his
Childe Harold. Of his language it has already been said that
he designedly uses the archaic, or that of Chaucer; or, as Pope
has said,
Spenser himself affects the obsolete.

The plan of the poem, neglecting the unities of an epic,
is like that of a general history, rambling and desultory, or like
the transformations of a fairy tale, as it is: his descriptions are
gorgeous, his verse exceedingly melodious, and his management of
it very graceful. The Gerusalemme Liberata of Tasso appeared while he
was writing the Faery Queene, and he imitated portions of that great
epic in his own, but his imitations are finer than the original.

HIS OTHER WORKS.--His other works need not detain us: Hymns in honor
of Love and Beauty, Prothalamion, and Epithalamion, Mother Hubbard's
Tale, Amoretti or Sonnets, The Tears of the Muses or Brittain's
Ida, are little read at the present day.

His Astrophel is a tender "pastoral elegie" upon the death of
the most noble and valorous knight, Sir Philip Sidney; and is
better known for its subject than for itself. This was a favorite
theme of the friendly and sensitive poet; he has also written
several elegies and æglogues in honor of Sidney.

SPENSER'S FATE.--The fate of Spenser is a commentary upon courtiership,
even in the reign of Elizabeth, the Faery Queene. Her requital of his
adoration was an annual pension of fifty pounds, and the
ruined castle and unprofitable estate of Kilcolman in Ireland, among
a half-savage population, in a period of insurrections and massacres,
with the requirement that he should reside upon his grant. An
occasional visit from Raleigh, then a captain in the army, a rambler
along the banks of the picturesque Mulla, and the composition and
arrangement of the great poem with the suggestions of his friend,
were at once his labors and his only recreations. He sighed after
the court, and considered himself as hardly used by the queen.

At length an insurrection broke out, and his home was set on fire:
he fled from his flaming castle, and in the confusion his infant
child was left behind and burned to death. A few months after, he
died in London, on January 16, 1598-9, broken-hearted and poor,
at an humble tavern, in King Street. Buried at the expense of the
Earl of Essex, Ann Countess of Dorset bore the expense of his
monument in
Westminster Abbey, in gratitude for his noble championship of woman.

Upon that are inscribed these words:
_Anglorum poetarum nostri seculi facile princeps_--truer words,
great as is the praise, than are usually found in monumental
inscriptions.

Whatever our estimate of Spenser, he must be regarded as the truest
literary exponent and representative of the age of Elizabeth, almost
as much her biographer as Miss Strickland, and her historian as
Hume: indeed, neither biographer nor historian could venture to
draw the lineaments of her character without having recourse to
Spenser and his literary contemporaries.

OTHER WRITERS OF THE AGE OF SPENSER.

_Richard Hooker_, 1553-1598: educated at Oxford, he became Master
of the Temple in London, a post which he left with pleasure to take
a country parish.

He wrote a famous work, entitled "A Treatise on the Laws of
Ecclesiastical Polity," which is remarkable for its profound
learning, powerful logic, and eloquence of style.

In it he defends the position of the Church of England, against
Popery on the one hand and Calvinism on the other.

_Robert Burton_, 1576-1639: author of "The Anatomy of Melancholie,"
an amusing and instructive medley of quotations and classical
anecdotes, showing a profound erudition.

In this all the causes and effects of melancholy are set forth with
varied illustrations.

His _nom de plume_ was Democritus, Jr., and he is an advocate of the
laughing philosophy.

_Thomas Hobbes_, 1588-1679: tutor to Charles II., when Prince of Wales,
and author of the _Leviathan_. This is a philosophical treatise,
in which he advocates monarchical government, as based upon the
fact that all men are selfish, and that human nature, being essentially
corrupt, requires an iron control: he also wrote upon _Liberty and
Necessity_, and on _Human Nature_.

John Stow, 1525-1605: tailor and antiquary. Principally valuable for
his "Annales," "Summary of English Chronicles," and "A Survey of
London."

The latter is the foundation of later topographical descriptions
of the English metropolis.

Raphael Hollinshed, or Holinshed, died about 1580: his _Chronicles
of Englande, Scotlande, and Irelande_, were a treasure-house to
Shakspeare, from which he drew materials for King Lear, Cymbeline,
Macbeth, and other plays.

Richard Hakluyt, died 1616: being greatly interested in voyages and
travels, he wrote works upon the adventures of others. Among these
are, "Divers Voyages Touching the Discoverie of America," and "Four
Voyages unto Florida," which have been very useful in the compilation
of early American history.

Samuel Purchas, 1577-1628: like Hakluyt, he was exceedingly
industrious in collecting material, and wrote "Hakluyt's Posthumus,
or Purchas, his Pilgrimes," a history of the world "in Sea Voyages
and Land Travels."
Sir Walter Raleigh, 1552-1618: a man famous for his personal
strength and comeliness, vigor of mind, valor, adventures, and
sufferings. A prominent actor in the stirring scenes of Elizabeth's
reign, he was high in the favor of the queen.

Accused of high treason on the accession of James I., and imprisoned
under sentence of death, an unsuccessful expedition to South
America in search of El Dorado, which caused complaints from the
Spanish king, led to his execution under the pending sentence. He
wrote, chiefly in prison, a History of the World, in which he was aided
by his literary friends, and which is highly commended.

It extends to the end of the second Macedonian war. Raleigh was also a
poet, and wrote several special treatises.

William Camden, 1551-1623: author of Britannia, or a chorographic
description of the most flourishing kingdoms of England, Scotland,
Ireland, and the adjacent islands, from the earliest antiquity.

This work, written in Latin, has been translated into English. He also
wrote a sketch of the reign of Elizabeth.

_George Buchanan_, 1506-1581: celebrated as a Latin writer, an
historian, a poet, and an ecclesiastical polemic.

He wrote a _History of Scotland_, a Latin version of the Psalms,
and a satire called _Chamæleon_.

He was a man of profound learning and indomitable
courage; and when told, just before his death, that the king was
incensed at his treatise _De Jure Regni_, he answered that he was
not concerned at that, for he was "going to a place where there
were few kings."

Thomas Sackville, Earl Dorset, Lord Buckhurst, 1536-1608: author,
or rather originator of "The Mirror for Magistrates," showing by
illustrious, unfortunate examples, the vanity and transitory
character of human success.

Of Sackville and his portion of the Mirror for Magistrates, Craik
says they "must be considered as forming the connecting link between
the Canterbury Tales and the Fairy Queen."

_Samuel Daniel_, 1562-1619: an historian and a poet.

His chief work is "The Historie of the Civile Warres between the
Houses of York and Lancaster," "a production," says Drake, "which
reflects great credit on the age in which it was written."

This work is in poetical form; and, besides it, he wrote many poems
and plays, and numerous sonnets.

Michael Drayton, 1563-1631: a versatile writer, most favorably known
through his _Polyolbion_, a poem in thirty books, containing a
detailed description of the topography of England, in Alexandrine
verses.

His _Barons' Wars_ describe the civil commotions during the reign of
Edward II.

Sir John Davies, 1570-1626: author of _Nosce Teipsum_ and _The
Orchestra_.

The former is commended by Hallam; and another critic
calls it "the best poem, except Spenser's Faery Queen, in Queen
Elizabeth's, or even, in James VI.'

s time."

John Donne, 1573-1631: a famous preacher, Dean of St.

Paul's: considered at the head of the metaphysical school of
poets: author of _Pseudo-Martyr_, _Polydoron_, and numerous
sermons. He wrote seven _satires_, which are valuable, but his
style is harsh, and his ideas far-fetched.

Joseph Hall, 1574-1656: an eminent divine, author of six books of
_satires_, of which he called the first three _toothless_, and the
others _biting_ satires.

These are valuable as presenting truthful pictures of the manners and
morals of the age and of the defects in contemporary literature.

Sir Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, 1554-1628: he wrote the Life of
Sidney, and requested to have placed upon his tomb, "The friend of
Sir Philip Sidney."

He was also the author of numerous treatises: "Monarchy," "Humane
Learning," "Wars," etc., and of two tragedies.

Reply Obj. 1: Connatural operation, which is unhindered, is a second
perfection, as stated in _De Anima_ ii, 1: and therefore when a thing
is established in its proper connatural and unhindered operation,
delight follows, which consists in a state of completion, as observed
above. Accordingly when we say that delight is an operation, we
designate, not its essence, but its cause.

Reply Obj. 2: A twofold movement is to be observed in an animal: one,
according to the intention of the end, and this belongs to the
appetite; the other, according to the execution, and this belongs to
the external operation. And so, although in him who has already
gained the good in which he delights, the movement of execution
ceases, by which he tends to the end; yet the movement of the
appetitive faculty does not cease, since, just as before it desired
that which it had not, so afterwards does it delight in that which is
possesses. For though delight is a certain repose of the appetite, if
we consider the presence of the pleasurable good that satisfies the
appetite, nevertheless there remains the impression made on the
appetite by its object, by reason of which delight is a kind of
movement.

Reply Obj. 3: Although the name of passion is more appropriate to
those passions which have a corruptive and evil tendency, such as
bodily ailments, as also sadness and fear in the soul; yet some
passions have a tendency to something good, as stated above (Q. 23,
AA. 1, 4): and in this sense delight is called a passion.

SECOND ARTICLE [I-II, Q. 31, Art. 2]

Whether Delight Is in Time?

Objection 1: It would seem that delight is in time. For "delight is
a kind of movement," as the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 11). But all
movement is in time. Therefore delight is in time.

Obj. 2: Further, a thing is said to last long and to be morose in
respect of time. But some pleasures are called morose. Therefore
pleasure is in time.

Obj. 3: Further, the passions of the soul are of one same genus. But
some passions of the soul are in time. Therefore delight is too.

_On the contrary,_ The Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4) that "no one
takes pleasure according to time."

_I answer that,_ A thing may be in time in two ways: first, by
itself; secondly, by reason of something else, and accidentally as
it were. THE CHARACTER OF THE AGE.

To cater further to the Artificial Age, the literary cravings of
which far exceeded those of any former period, there sprang
up a school of Essayists, most of whom were also poets, dramatists,
and politicians.
Among these Addison, Steele, and Swift stand pre-eminent. Each of them
was a man of distinct and interesting personality. Two of
them--Addison and Swift--presented such a remarkable contrast, that
it has been usual for writers on this period of English Literature
to bring them together as foils to each other.

This has led to injustice towards Swift; they should be placed in
juxtaposition because they are of the same period, and because of
their joint efforts in the literary development of the age. The
period is distinctly marked. We speak as currently of the wits and
the essayists of Queen Anne's reign as we do of the authors of the
Elizabethan age.

A glance at contemporary history will give us an intelligent clue to
our literary inquiries, and cause us to observe the historical
character of the literature.

To a casual observer, the reign of Queen Anne seems particularly
untroubled and prosperous.

English history calls it the time of "Good Queen Anne;" and it is
referred to with great unction by the _laudator temporis acti_,
in unjust comparison with the period which has since intervened,
as well as with that which preceded it.

QUEEN ANNE.--The queen was a Protestant, as opposed to the
Romanists and Jacobites; a faithful wife, and a tender mother in her
memory of several children who died young. She was merciful, pure,
and gracious to her subjects. Her
reign was tolerant.

There was plenty at home; rebellion and civil war were at least
latent.

Abroad, England was greatly distinguished by the victories of
Marlborough and Eugene.

But to one who looks through this veil of prosperity, a curious
history is unfolded. The fires of faction were scarcely smouldering.
It was the transition period between the expiring dynasty of the
direct line of Stuarts and the coming of the Hanoverian house.

Women took part in politics; sermons like that of Sacheverell against
the dissenters and the government were thundered from the pulpit.
Volcanic fires were at work; the low rumblings of an earthquake
were heard from time to time, and gave constant cause of concern
to the queen and her statesmen.

Men of rank conspired against each other; the moral license of former
reigns seems to have been forgotten in political intrigue.
When James II. had been driven out in 1688, the English conscience
compromised on the score of the divine right of kings, by taking
his daughter Mary and her husband as joint monarchs.

To do this, they affected to call the king's son by his second
wife, born in that year, a pretender. It was said that he was the child
of another woman, and had been brought to the queen's bedside in
a warming-pan, that James might be able to present, thus fraudulently,
a Roman Catholic heir to the throne.

In this they did the king injustice, and greater injustice to the
queen, Maria de Modena, a pleasing and innocent woman, who had, by
her virtues and personal popularity alone, kept the king on his
throne, in spite of his pernicious measures.

When the dynasty was overthrown, the parliament had presented to
William and Mary _A Bill of Rights_, in which the people's grievances
were set forth, and their rights enumerated and insisted upon;
and this was accepted by the monarchs as a condition of their tenure.

Mary died in 1695, and when William followed her, in 1702, Anne, the
second daughter of James, ascended the throne.

Had she refused the succession, there would have been a furious war
between the Jacobites and the Hanoverians. In 1714, Anne died childless,
but her reign had bridged the chasm between the experiment of
William and Mary and the house of Hanover. In default of direct
heirs to Queen Anne, the succession was in this Hanoverian house;
represented in the person of the Electress Sophia, the granddaughter
of James I., through his daughter, Elizabeth of Bohemia.

But this lineage of blood had lost all English affinities and
sympathies.

Meanwhile, the child born to James II., in 1688, had grown to be a
man, and stood ready, on the death of Queen Anne, to re-affirm
his claim to the throne.

It was said that, although, on account of the plottings of the
Jacobites, a price had been put upon his head, the queen herself
wished him to succeed, and had expressed scruples about her own right
to reign.
She greatly disliked the family of Hanover, and while she was on
her death-bed, the pretender had been brought to England, in the
hope that she would declare him her successor. The elements of
discord asserted themselves still more strongly.Reply Obj. 3: These other names pertaining to delight are derived
from the effects of delight; for _laetitia_ (gladness) is derived
from the "dilation" of the heart, as if one were to say "latitia";
"exultation" is derived from the exterior signs of inward delight,
which appear outwardly in so far as the inward joy breaks forth from
its bounds; and "cheerfulness" is so called from certain special
signs and effects of gladness. This ideas: poet in in which good is

Or we may
say that he is defining delight of the sensitive appetite.

Reply Obj. 2: Delight has the character of passion, properly
speaking, when accompanied by bodily transmutation. It is not thus in
the intellectual appetite, but according to simple movement: for thus
it is also in God and the angels. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic.
vii, 14) that "God rejoices by one simple act": and Dionysius says at
the end of _De Coel. Hier.,_ that "the angels are not susceptible to
our passible delight, but rejoice together with God with the gladness
of incorruption."

Reply Obj. 3: In us there is delight, not only in common with dumb
animals, but also in common with angels. Wherefore Dionysius says (De
Coel. Hier.) that "holy men often take part in the angelic delights."
Accordingly we have delight, not only in the sensitive appetite,
which we have in common with dumb animals, but also in the
intellectual appetite, which we have in common with the angels.

If therefore we compare intellectual pleasures with sensible
pleasures, according as we delight in the very actions, for instance
in sensitive and in intellectual knowledge; without doubt
intellectual pleasures are much greater than sensible pleasures. For
man takes much more delight in knowing something, by understanding
it, than in knowing something by perceiving it with his sense.
Because intellectual knowledge is more perfect; and because it is
better known, since the intellect reflects on its own act more than
sense does. Moreover intellectual knowledge is more beloved: for
there is no one who would not forfeit his bodily sight rather than
his intellectual vision, as beasts or fools are deprived thereof, as
Augustine says in De Civ. Dei (De Trin. xiv, 14).

Many of his discourse have been print. Among his dissertation
is one entitled,_Irenicum, a Weapon-Salve for the Churches
Wounds, or the Divine abstraction of Particular Forms of Protestant
bureaucracy discourse and Examined_." The statement," state Bishop
Burnet," was managed with thus much conditioning and ability that none
of either hand ever undertook to rescript it." He besides wrote_Origines
Sacræ, or a Rational etymology of the Christian Faith_, and various
dissertation in favor of Protestantism and against the Church of
Roma._William Sherlock_, 1678-1761: he was Dean of St. Saul's, and
a communicator of numerous doctrinal context, among which are those
on_The Trinity_, and on_Death and the hereafter Judgment_. His
boy, Thomas detective, D.D., born 1678, was besides a distinguished
theological author._Gilbert Burnet_, 1643-1715: he was very much
of a politico, and act a prominent relation in the rotation. He was
made Bishop of Salisbury in 1689. He is principally known by his_History
of the Reformation_, written in the WASP involvement, and by his
lesser employment, the_History of my Own Times_. Not without a decided
partiality, this latter activity is particularly valuable as the
narrative of an eye-witness. The history has been diversely criticized
for prepossess and inaccuracy; but it fills what would otherwise
have been a great vacuity in English diachronic writing._John
Locke_, 1632-1704. In a account of philosophy, the name of this
distinguished philosopher would busy a prominent point, and his
brewery would necessitate extended notice.On the other hand, in relation to us, bodily pleasures are more
vehement, for three reasons. First, because sensible things are more
known to us, than intelligible things. Secondly, because sensible
pleasures, through being passions of the sensitive appetite, are
accompanied by some alteration in the body: whereas this does not
occur in spiritual pleasures, save by reason of a certain reaction of
the superior appetite on the lower. Thirdly, because bodily pleasures
are sought as remedies for bodily defects or troubles, whence various
griefs arise. Wherefore bodily pleasures, by reason of their
succeeding griefs of this kind, are felt the more, and consequently
are welcomed more than spiritual pleasures, which have no contrary
griefs, as we shall state farther on (Q. 35, A. 5).

Wherefore the senses afford pleasure in both these ways. But because
it is proper to man to apprehend knowledge itself as something good,
it follows that the former pleasures of the senses, i.e. those which
arise from knowledge, are proper to man: whereas pleasures of the
senses, as loved for their usefulness, are common to all animals.
