afraid--I'd be proud."

"Wait till it happens."

There followed a struggle of immense insincerity between us. It is hard
to tell who urged and who resisted.

She came to me one night to the editorial room of the BLUE WEEKLY, and
argued and kissed me with wet salt lips, and wept in my arms; she told
me that now passionate longing for me and my intimate life possessed
her, so that she could not work, could not think, could not endure other
people for the love of me....

I fled absurdly. That is the secret of the futile journey to America
that puzzled all my friends.

I had had some hint of it in her letters, but now I saw it plainly. I
came out of my study upon the landing when I heard the turmoil of her
arrival below, and she came upstairs with a quickened gladness. It was a
cold March, and she was dressed in unfamiliar dark furs that suited her
extremely and reinforced the delicate flush of her sweet face. She held
out both her hands to me, and drew me to her unhesitatingly and kissed
me.

"So glad you are back, dear," she said. "Oh! so very glad you are back."

I returned her kiss with a queer feeling at my heart, too
undifferentiated to be even a definite sense of guilt or meanness. I
think it was chiefly amazement--at the universe--at myself.

"I never knew what it was to be away from you," she said.

I perceived suddenly that she had resolved to end our estrangement. She
put herself so that my arm came caressingly about her.

"These are jolly furs," I said.

"I got them for you."

The parlourmaid appeared below dealing with the maid and the luggage
cab.

"Tell me all about America," said Margaret. "I feel as though you'd been
away six year's."

We went arm in arm into our little sitting-room, and I took off the
fur's for her and sat down upon the chintz-covered sofa by the fire.
She had ordered tea, and came and sat by me. They some were veteran-looking
warriors, and bore upon them the marks of dust-stained travel. to
Their bronzed faces were turned towards the flag that floated over
the building, the tricolored cockade, and shouted," Vive not

before me no man sees twice in this world.

I bowed my head to hide my face, and found her hand in mine and kissed
it.

"Ah!" she said, and slowly withdrew her hand. She leant forward with her
arm on the sofa-back, and looked very intently into my face. I felt the
most damnable scoundrel in the world as I returned her gaze. The thought
of Isabel's darkly shining eyes seemed like a physical presence between
us....

"Tell me," I said presently, to break the intolerable tension, "tell me
plainly what you mean by this."

I sat a little away from her, and then took my teacup in hand, with an
odd effect of defending myself. There was nothing in common between them
and the men of the Republic, or of the Empire.

They assumed an air of superiority, which the latter answered with
the most undisguised contempt. Ridicule, that fearful political
engine, which, especially in France, is sufficient to batter down
the hopes of any aspirant who lays himself open to it, and which
Napoleon himself, in his greatest power, feared more than foreign
armies or intestine conspiracies, was most unsparingly directed
against them.

The print-shops exposed them in every possible form of caricature,
the theatres burlesqued their pretensions, songs and epigrams
contributed to their discomfiture, and all the ingenuity of a witty
and laughter-loving people was unmercifully poured out upon this
resurrection of antediluvian remains.

Their royal patrons came in for a full share of the general derision,
but they seemed entirely unmindful that there was such a thing as
popular opinion, or any other will than their own.

There were objects all around them which might have preached to them
of the uncertainty of human grandeur and the vanity of kingly pride,
reminding them that there is but a step from the palace to the scaffold,
which step had been taken by more than one of their family.
The walls of their abode were yet marked by musket-balls, mementos of a
day of appalling violence, and from the windows they could see the
public square where the guillotine had permanently stood and the
pavement had been crimsoned with the blood of their race.

I walked in with it,
and put it down on the table and turned to go.

"Husband!" she cried, and held out her slender arms to me. How it

.There came a little pause. "Good-night, Margaret,"
I repeated, and walked very deliberately and with a kind of sham
preoccupation to the door.

Napoleon was gone. His empire was in the dust. The streets of his capital
were filled with strangers, and the volatile Parisians were almost
compensated for the degradation, in their wonder at the novel garb
and uncouth figures of their enemies.
