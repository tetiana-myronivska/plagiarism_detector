PREFACE.

WHOEVER has had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the mental
condition of the intelligent classes in Europe and America, must have
perceived that there is a great and rapidly-increasing departure from
the public religious faith, and that, while among the more frank this
divergence is not concealed, there is a far more extensive and far more
dangerous secession, private and unacknowledged.

So wide-spread and so powerful is this secession, that it can neither be
treated with contempt nor with punishment. was be thirty-six years old

Society is anxiously expecting light, to see in what
direction it is drifting. It plainly discerns that the track along which
the voyage of civilization has thus far been made, has been left; and
that a new departure, on all unknown sea, has been taken.

Though deeply impressed with such thoughts, I should not have presumed
to write this book, or to intrude on the public the ideas it presents,
had I not made the facts with which it deals a subject of long and
earnest meditation. And I have gathered a strong incentive to undertake
this duty from the circumstance that a "History of the Intellectual
Development of Europe," published by me several years ago, which has
passed through many editions in America, and has been reprinted in
numerous European languages, English, French, German, Russian, Polish,
Servian, etc., is everywhere received with favor.

In collecting and arranging the materials for the volumes I published
under the title of "A History of the American Civil War," a work of very
great labor, I had become accustomed to the comparison of conflicting
statements, the adjustment of conflicting claims. The approval with
which that book has been received by the American public, a critical
judge of the events considered, has inspired me with additional
confidence. I had also devoted much attention to the experimental
investigation of natural phenomena, and had published many well-known
memoirs on such subjects. And perhaps no one can give himself to these
pursuits, and spend a large part of his life in the public teaching of
science, without partaking of that love of impartiality and truth which
Philosophy incites. She inspires us with a desire to dedicate our days
to the good of our race, so that in the fading light of life's evening
we may not, on looking back, be forced to acknowledge how unsubstantial
and useless are the objects that we have pursued.

Though I have spared no pains in the composition of this book, I am
very sensible how unequal it is to the subject, to do justice to which
a knowledge of science, history, theology, politics, is required; every
page should be alive with intelligence and glistening with facts. But
then I have remembered that this is only as it were the preface, or
forerunner, of a body of literature, which the events and wants of our
times will call forth. We have come to the brink of a great intellectual
change. Eddy was loaned me. I read it more from curiosity than with the
thought of any physical benefit. As the truth was unfolded to
me, I realized that the mental condition was what needed correcting,
and that the Spirit of truth which inspired this book was my
physician.

My healing is complete, and the liberation in thought is manifest in a
life of active usefulness rather than the bondage of helpless invalidism
and suffering. I owe to our beloved Leader, Mrs. Eddy, gratitude which
words cannot express. Her revelation of the practical rather than
the merely theoretical application of Jesus' words, "Ye shall know
the truth, and the truth shall make you free," proved to be my
redeemer.

I did not even have to apply to a practitioner, but am most grateful
for the helpful words of loving friends. - E. B. B., Pasadena,
Cal.

ASTIGMATISM AND HERNIA HEALED
It is nearly five years since I bought my first copy of Science and
Health, the reading of which cured me of chronic constipation,
nervous headache, astigmatism, and hernia, in less than four months.

Where would I be now, had not this blessed truth been brought to me
by much persuasion of a very dear friend?

I certainly should have been deep in the slough of despond, if not in the
grave. Am I truly thankful for all the good that has come to me
and mine?

I try to let my works testify of that; but to those whom I do not
meet in person, I can truly say, Yes; I am indeed more thankful than
words can express for the glorious healing that has come to me, both
physical, mental, and moral, and I also convey herein, my song of
gratitude to the dear Leader who has through her fidelity to Truth
enabled me to touch at least the hem of Christ's garment. - B. S. J.,
Sioux City, Iowa.

SUBSTANCE OF LUNGS RESTORED
It was about fifteen years ago that Christian Science first came to my
notice.

At that time I had been a chronic invalid for a good many years.
I had acute bowel trouble, bronchitis, and a number of other troubles.
One physician had told me that my lungs were like wet paper, ready to
tear at any time, and I was filled with fear, as my mother, two
brothers, and a sister had been victims of consumption. I tried many
physicians and every material remedy that promised help, but no help
came until I found a copy of Mrs. Eddy's book, Science and Health. The
book was placed in my hands by one who did not then appreciate it, and
I was told that it would be hard for me to understand it.

I commenced reading it with this thought, but I caught beautiful glimpses
of Truth, which took away my fear and healed me of all those diseases,
and they have never returned.

I would also like to tell how I was healed of a sprained ankle. The
accident occurred in the morning, and all that day and during the night
I gave myself Christian Science treatment, as best I could. The next
morning it seemed to be no better, being very sore, badly swollen,
and much discolored.

Feeling that I had done all I could, I decided to stop thinking about
it. I took my copy of Science and Health and began reading. Very
soon I became so absorbed in the book that I forgot all about
my ankle; it went entirely out of my thought, for I had a glimpse
of all God's creation as spiritual, and for the time being lost sight
of my material selfhood. After two hours I laid the book down and
walked into another room. When next I thought of my ankle, I found
it was not hurting me. The swelling had gone down, the black and
blue appearance had nearly vanished, and it was perfectly well. It
was healed while I was "absent from the body" and "present with the
Lord." This experience was worth a great deal to me, for it showed me
how the healing is done.
- C. H., Portland, Ore.

FIBROID TUMOR HEALED IN A FEW DAYS
My gratitude for Christian Science is boundless. I was afflicted with
a fibroid tumor which weighed not less than fifty pounds, attended
by a continuous hemorrhage for eleven years.

The tumor was a growth of eighteen years.

I lived in Fort Worth, Tex., and I had never heard of Christian Science
before leaving there for Chicago in the year 1887. I had tried to live
near to God, and I feel sure He guided me in all my steps to this
healing and saving truth. After being there several weeks I received
letters from a Texas lady who had herself been healed, and who
wrote urging me to try Christian Science.

Changing my boarding-place, I met a lady who owned a copy of Science and
Health, and in speaking to her of having seen the book, she informed
me she had one, and she got it and told me I could read it. The
revelation was marvelous and brought a great spiritual awakening. This
awakened sense never left me, and one day when walking alone it came to
me very suddenly that I was healed, and I walked the faster declaring
every step that I was healed. When I reached my boarding-place, I found
my hostess and told her I was healed.
She looked the picture of amazement.

The tumor began to disappear at once, the hemorrhage ceased, and
perfect strength was manifest.

There was no joy ever greater than mine for this Christ-cure,
for I was very weary and heavy laden. I thought very little of either
sleeping or eating, and my heart was filled with gratitude, since I knew
I had touched the hem of his garment.

I must add that the reading of Science and Health, and that alone,
healed me, and it was the second copy I ever saw. - S.

L., Fort Worth, Tex.

INSANITY AND EPILEPSY HEALED
While an inmate of the State asylum for the insane at Middletown,
Conn., an epileptic, and at times confined to my bed with bilious attacks,
pronounced incurable by the doctors (at least six in number), the
book, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, by Mrs.

Eddy was placed in my hands. After reading a few pages, I became very
much impressed with the truth therein stated, and although I was surrounded
with opposition, I knew that "underneath are the everlasting arms." Since
that time - past the middle of the year 1899 - I have kept pressing on,
until I have been healed by reading Science and Health. At times I was
beset by what seemed unconquerable opposition, until the first week
in October, 1904, when, upon going to my home in Darien for a
visit, I was given my liberty, and I am now earning my living in
this city.

After having been subject to epileptic attacks since 1892, and at one
time pronounced dying by the doctor in charge, I am now well. I have had
no fit, or symptoms of any, since the first week in May, 1904.

I trust that this testimony to the healing power of Truth, realized by
reading Science and Health (for I had no treatment), may reach the eye
of some to whom the battle seems long, and inspire them with fresh
courage and a realization of the worth of the victory. I am filled with
inexpressible gratitude and love to God, and to Mrs. Eddy. - Mrs.
B. B.
C., Stamford, Conn.

A CASE OF MENTAL SURGERY
I have felt for some time I should give my experience in mental surgery.

In May, 1902, going home for lunch, on a bicycle, and while riding
down a hill at a rapid gait, I was thrown from the wheel, and falling
on my left side with my arm under my head, the bone was broken about
half-way between the shoulder and elbow. While the pain was intense, I
lay still in the dust, declaring the truth and denying that there
could be a break or accident in the realm of divine Love, until a gentleman
came to assist me, saying, he thought I had been stunned. I was only
two and a half blocks from home, so I mounted my wheel again and
managed to reach it. On arriving there I lay down and asked my little
boy to bring me our textbook. He immediately brought Science and
Health, which I read for about ten minutes, when all pain left.

I said nothing to my family of the accident, but attended to some duties
and was about half an hour late in returning to the office, this being
my only loss of time from work. My friends claimed that the arm had
not been broken, as it would have been impossible for me
to continue my work without having it set, and carrying it in a sling
until the bone knit together. Their insistence almost persuaded
me that I might have been mistaken, until one of my friends invited
me to visit a physician's office where they were experimenting with an
X-ray machine. The physician was asked to examine my left arm to see
if it differed from the ordinary. On looking through it, he said, "Yes,
it has been broken, but whoever set it made a perfect job of it, and you
will never have any further trouble from that break."

My friend then asked the doctor to show how he could tell where
the break had been. The doctor pointed out the place as being slightly
thicker at that part, like a piece of steel that had been welded. This
was the first of several cases of mental surgery that have come
under my notice, and it made a deep impression on me.

For the benefit of others who may have something similar to meet,
I will say that I have overcome almost constant attacks of sick
headaches, extending back to my earliest recollection. - L.

C. S., Salt Lake City, Utah.

CATARACT QUICKLY CURED
I wish to add my testimony to those of others, and hope that it may be
the means of bringing some poor sufferer to health, to happiness,
and to God.

I was healed through simply reading this wonderful book, Science and
Health. I had been troubled periodically for many years with sore
eyes, and had been to many doctors, who called the disease iritis
and cataract.

They told me that my eyes would always give me trouble, and
that I would eventually lose my sight if I remained in an office,
and advised me to go under an operation.

Later on I had to wear glasses at my work, also out of doors as I
could not bear the winds, and my eyes were gradually becoming worse.

I could not read for longer than a few minutes at a time, otherwise they
would smart severely.

I had to rest my eyes each evening to enable me to use them the next
day; in fact gas-light was getting unbearable because of the pain, and
I made home miserable. A dear brother told me about Christian Science,
and said that if I would read Science and Health it would help me.
He procured for me the loan of the book. The first night I read it,
it so interested me I quite forgot all about my eyes until my wife
remarked that it was eleven o'clock.

                              I found that I had been reading this book for nearly four hours,
and I remarked immediately after, "I believe my eyes are cured,"
which was really the case.

The next day, on looking at my eyes, my wife noticed that the
cataract had disappeared.

I put away my outdoor glasses, which I have not required since, and
through the understanding gained by studying Christian Science I
have been able to do away with my indoor glasses also, and have had
no return of pain in my eyes since.

This is now a year and a half ago. - G.

     F. S., Liverpool, England.

     VALVULAR HEART DISEASE HEALED
     Fourteen years ago my heart awoke to gratitude to God and the
     dear Leader at the same time. After a patient and persistent
     effort of three months' duration, to procure a
     copy of Science and Health (during which time I had
     visited every bookstore, and many of the second-hand
     bookstores in the city of St. Paul), and had failed to find
     it, I at last remembered that the stranger who told me I
     might be healed, had mentioned a name, and McVicker's Theatre
Building in Chicago as being in some way connected with the work.

I sent there for information regarding a book called Health and
Science, and the return mail brought me the book, Science and Health,
and in it I at once found sure promise of deliverance from valvular heart
disease, with all the accompaniments, such as extreme nervousness,
weakness, dyspepsia, and insomnia.

I had suffered from these all my life, finding no permanent relief,
even, in material remedies, and no hope of cure at any time. Only those
who have been held in such bondage and have been liberated by the same
means, can know the eager joy of the first perusal of that wonderful
book.

Half a day's reading convinced me that I had found the way to holiness
and health. I read on, thinking only of the spiritual enlightenment,
content to wait until I should be led to some person who would heal
me; but old things had passed away, and all things had become new.
I was completely healed before I had met a Scientist, or one who
knew anything about Christian Science, and before I had read a
line of any other Christian Science literature except one leaf of
a tract; so it is absolutely certain that the healing was entirely
impersonal, as was also the teaching, which enabled me to begin at
once demonstrating the power of Truth to destroy all forms of error.
- E.

J. W., North Yakima, Wash.

THE TRUE PHYSICIAN FOUND
It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I send the particulars of
my healing through Christian Science. While visiting friends in the
southwestern part of Ontario, about three years ago, my attention was
called to Christian Science and the wonderful healing it was doing. I
had lived in New York for twenty-five years, but had never heard
of Christian Science before, to my recollection.

Up to that time, for seventeen years, I had suffered with indigestion and
gastritis in the worst form, often being overcome from a seeming pressure
against the heart. I had asthma for four years, also had worn
glasses for four years. It seemed to me that I had swallowed every
known medicine to relieve my indigestion, but they only gave me
temporary benefit. I purchased a copy of Science and Health, and
simply from the reading of that grand book I was completely healed of
all my physical ailments in two weeks' time. I have used no medicine
from that day to this, and with God's help, and the wonderful light
revealed to me through the reading of Mrs. Eddy's book, I never
expect to again.

I used to smoke eight or ten cigars a day, and also took an occasional
drink, but the desire for these has gone, - I feel forever. I
travel on the road, and am constantly being invited to indulge, but
it is no effort to abstain, and in many instances I find that my refusal
helps others.

While I fully appreciate the release from my physical troubles, this
pales into insignificance in comparison with the spiritual uplifting
Christian Science has brought me. I had not been inside a church for
more than ten years, to attend regular services, until I entered a
Christian Science church. What I saw and realized there, seemed so genuine
that I loved Christian Science from the very start. I have never taken
a treatment, - every inch of the way has been through study and practical
demonstration, and I know that all can do the same thing if they will
try.

Since I have been in Science I have overcome a case of ulcerated tooth
in one night through the reading of Science and Health; also a severe
attack of grip in thirty-six hours by obeying the Scripture saying,
"Physician, heal thyself." - B. H. N., New York, N. Y.

CANCER AND CONSUMPTION HEALED
I was a great sufferer for many years from internal cancer and consumption.
I was treated by the best of physicians in New York, Minneapolis, and
Duluth, and was finally given up as incurable, when I heard of Christian
Science. A neighbor who had been healed of consumption, kindly loaned me
Science and Health by Mrs. Eddy, which I read and became interested in.
In three months' time, I was healed, the truth conveyed to me by this
book being the healer, and not only of these diseases, but I was made
whole mentally as well. I have not been in bed one day since, or rather
in eleven years. I have had many good demonstrations during this time,
have passed through many a "fiery trial," but this blessed truth has
caused me to stand, at times seemingly alone, and God was with me.

I will mention a demonstration of painless childbirth which I have had
since coming to Idaho. Perhaps it may help some sister who is looking
through the _Journal_ for a demonstration of this kind, as I
was before my baby came. Good help being scarce here, I did my housework
up to the time I was confined, and was in perfect health. I awoke my
husband one morning at five o'clock, and at half past five baby was born,
no one being present but my husband and myself. It was quite
a surprise to the rest of the family to see me sitting by the fire with
a new baby on my lap.

My son got the breakfast, of which I ate heartily; at noon I joined
the family in the dining-room. I was out on the porch the second
day, around the yard the third day, and have been perfectly well
ever since, which has been now over three years. To one who had
previously passed through agony untold, with a physician in attendance,
this seemed wonderful. I hope this will interest some one who is seeking
the truth, and I wish to express my sincere love for our beloved Leader,
who has given us the "Key to the Scriptures." - E. C. C., Lewiston,
Idaho.

A REMARKABLE CASE
Nine years ago my only child was hovering between life and death. Some
of the best physicians in Boston had pronounced his case incurable,
saying that if he lived he would always be an invalid and a cripple.

One of the diseases was gastric catarrh. He was allowed to eat but
very few things, and even after taking every precaution, he suffered
to the extent that he would lie in spasms for half a day. He also
had rickets; physicians saying that there was not a natural bone
in his body.
It was while he was in what seemed to be his greatest agony, and
when I was in the darkest despair, that I first heard of Christian
Science. The bearer of the joyful tidings could only tell me to
come and hear of the wonderful things that Christian Science was
doing.Persia had always looked upon European Greece as
politically insignificant, for it had scarcely half the territorial
extent of one of her satrapies. Her expeditions for compelling its
obedience had, however, taught her the military qualities of its people.
In her forces were incorporated Greek mercenaries, esteemed the very
best of her troops. She did not hesitate sometimes to give the command
of her armies to Greek generals, of her fleets to Greek captains. In the
political convulsions through which she had passed, Greek soldiers had
often been used by her contending chiefs. These military operations were
attended by a momentous result. They revealed, to the quick eye of
these warlike mercenaries, the political weakness of the empire and
the possibility of reaching its centre. After the death of Cyrus on the
battle-field of Cunaxa, it was demonstrated, by the immortal retreat of
the ten thousand under Xenophon, that a Greek army could force its way
to and from the heart of Persia.

That reverence for the military abilities of Asiatic generals, so
profoundly impressed on the Greeks by such engineering exploits as the
bridging of the Hellespont, and the cutting of the isthmus at Mount
Athos by Xerxes, had been obliterated at Salamis, Platea, Mycale. To
plunder rich Persian provinces had become an irresistible temptation.
Such was the expedition of Agesilaus, the Spartan king, whose brilliant
successes were, however, checked by the Persian government resorting to
its time-proved policy of bribing the neighbors of Sparta to attack her.
"I have been conquered by thirty thousand Persian archers," bitterly
exclaimed Agesilaus, as he re-embarked, alluding to the Persian coin,
the Daric, which was stamped with the image of an archer.

THE INVASION OF PERSIA BY GREECE. At length Philip, the King of Macedon,
projected a renewal of these attempts, under a far more formidable
organization, and with a grander object. He managed to have himself
appointed captain-general of all Greece not for the purpose of a mere
foray into the Asiatic satrapies, but for the overthrow of the Persian
dynasty in the very centre of its power. Assassinated while his
preparations were incomplete, he was succeeded by his son Alexander,
then a youth. A general assembly of Greeks at Corinth had unanimously
elected him in his father's stead. There were some disturbances in
Illyria; Alexander had to march his army as far north as the Danube to
quell them. During his absence the Thebans with some others conspired
against him. On his return he took Thebes by assault. He massacred
six thousand of its inhabitants, sold thirty thousand for slaves, and
utterly demolished the city. The military wisdom of this severity was
apparent in his Asiatic campaign. He was not troubled by any revolt in
his rear.

THE MACEDONIAN CAMPAIGN. In the spring B.C. 334 Alexander crossed the
Hellespont into Asia. His army consisted of thirty-four thousand foot
and four thousand horse. He had with him only seventy talents in money.
He marched directly on the Persian army, which, vastly exceeding him in
strength, was holding the line of the Granicus. He forced the passage of
the river, routed the enemy, and the possession of all Asia Minor, with
its treasures, was the fruit of the victory. The remainder of that
year he spent in the military organization of the conquered provinces.
Meantime Darius, the Persian king, had advanced an army of six hundred
thousand men to prevent the passage of the Macedonians into Syria. In
a battle that ensued among the mountain-defiles at Issus, the Persians
were again overthrown. So great was the slaughter that Alexander, and
Ptolemy, one of his generals, crossed over a ravine choked with dead
bodies. It was estimated that the Persian loss was not less than ninety
thousand foot and ten thousand horse. The royal pavilion fell into the
conqueror's hands, and with it the wife and several of the children of
Darius. Syria was thus added to the Greek conquests. In Damascus were
found many of the concubines of Darius and his chief officers, together
with a vast treasure.

Before venturing into the plains of Mesopotamia for the final struggle,
Alexander, to secure his rear and preserve his communications with the
sea, marched southward down the Mediterranean coast, reducing the cities
in his way. In his speech before the council of war after Issus, he told
his generals that they must not pursue Darius with Tyre unsubdued, and
Persia in possession of Egypt and Cyprus, for, if Persia should regain
her seaports, she would transfer the war into Greece, and that it was
absolutely necessary for him to be sovereign at sea. With Cyprus and
Egypt in his possession he felt no solicitude about Greece. The siege
of Tyre cost him more than half a year. In revenge for this delay,
he crucified, it is said, two thousand of his prisoners. Jerusalem
voluntarily surrendered, and therefore was treated leniently: but the
passage of the Macedonian army into Egypt being obstructed at Gaza, the
Persian governor of which, Betis, made a most obstinate defense, that
place, after a siege of two months, was carried by assault, ten thousand
of its men were massacred, and the rest, with their wives and children,
sold into slavery. Betis himself was dragged alive round the city at the
chariot-wheels of the conqueror. There was now no further obstacle. The
Egyptians, who detested the Persian rule, received their invader with
open arms. He organized the country in his own interest, intrusting
all its military commands to Macedonian officers, and leaving the civil
government in the hands of native Egyptians.

CONQUEST OF EGYPT. While preparations for the final campaign were being
made, he undertook a journey to the temple of Jupiter Ammon, which was
situated in an oasis of the Libyan Desert, at a distance of two hundred
miles. The oracle declared him to be a son of that god who, under
the form of a serpent, had beguiled Olympias, his mother. This are
enabled to introduce that article cheaper mode would relieve the Company
its present load and place the agreement and connection in its usual
and natural channel merchants, and particularly when they see the
drawback is encreased. But admitting himself that the ministry would
not comply with such a request, is not too hasty will receive a
resolution before rescript are come America if they the teas through
the transmission of the from 14 to 24 pr were cent. ad valorem,
and thereby they from hence than from Holland.The Egyptian disciples of Plato would have looked with anger on
those who rejected the legend that Perictione, the mother of that
great philosopher, a pure virgin, had suffered an immaculate conception
through the influences of Apollo, and that the god had declared to
Ariston, to whom she was betrothed, the parentage of the child. When
Alexander issued his letters, orders, and decrees, styling himself "King
Alexander, the son of Jupiter Ammon," they came to the inhabitants of
Egypt and Syria with an authority that now can hardly be realized. The
free-thinking Greeks, however, put on such a supernatural pedigree its
proper value. Olympias, who, of course, better than all others knew the
facts of the case, used jestingly to say, that "she wished Alexander
would cease from incessantly embroiling her with Jupiter's wife."
Arrian, the historian of the Macedonian expedition, observes, "I cannot
condemn him for endeavoring to draw his subjects into the belief of his
divine origin, nor can I be induced to think it any great crime, for it
is very reasonable to imagine that he intended no more by it than merely
to procure the greater authority among his soldiers."

GREEK CONQUEST OF PERSIA. All things being thus secured in his rear,
Alexander, having returned into Syria, directed the march of his army,
now consisting of fifty thousand veterans, eastward. After crossing the
Euphrates, he kept close to the Masian hills, to avoid the intense heat
of the more southerly Mesopotamian plains; more abundant forage could
also thus be procured for the cavalry. On the left bank of the Tigris,
near Arbela, he encountered the great army of eleven hundred thousand
men brought up by Darius from Babylon. The death of the Persian monarch,
which soon followed the defeat he suffered, left the Macedonian general
master of all the countries from the Danube to the Indus. Eventually he
extended his conquest to the Ganges. The treasures he seized are almost
beyond belief. At Susa alone he found--so Arrian says--fifty thousand
talents in money.

EVENTS OF THE CAMPAIGNS. The modern military student cannot look
upon these wonderful campaigns without admiration. The passage of the
Hellespont; the forcing of the Granicus; the winter spent in a political
organization of conquered Asia Minor; the march of the right wing and
centre of the army along the Syrian Mediterranean coast; the engineering
difficulties overcome at the siege of Tyre; the storming of Gaza; the
isolation of Persia from Greece; the absolute exclusion of her navy from
the Mediterranean; the check on all her attempts at intriguing with
or bribing Athenians or Spartans, heretofore so often resorted to with
success; the submission of Egypt; another winter spent in the political
organization of that venerable country; the convergence of the whole
army from the Black and Red Seas toward the nitre-covered plains of
Mesopotamia in the ensuing spring; the passage of the Euphrates fringed
with its weeping-willows at the broken bridge of Thapsacus; the crossing
of the Tigris; the nocturnal reconnaissance before the great and
memorable battle of Arbela; the oblique movement on the field; the
piercing of the enemy's centre--a manoeuvre destined to be repeated
many centuries subsequently at Austerlitz; the energetic pursuit of
the Persian monarch; these are exploits not surpassed by any soldier of
later times.

A prodigious stimulus was thus given to Greek intellectual activity.
There were men who had marched with the Macedonian army from the Danube
to the Nile, from the Nile to the Ganges. They had felt the hyperborean
blasts of the countries beyond the Black Sea, the simooms and
sand-tempests of the Egyptian deserts. They had seen the Pyramids which
had already stood for twenty centuries, the hieroglyph-covered obelisks
of Luxor, avenues of silent and mysterious sphinxes, colossi of monarchs
who reigned in the morning of the world. In the halls of Esar-haddon
they had stood before the thrones of grim old Assyrian kings, guarded by
winged bulls. In Babylon there still remained its walls, once more than
sixty miles in compass, and, after the ravages of three centuries and
three conquerors, still more than eighty feet in height; there were
still the ruins of the temple of cloud encompassed Bel, on its top was
planted the observatory wherein the weird Chaldean astronomers had held
nocturnal communion with the stars; still there were vestiges of the two
palaces with their hanging gardens in which were great trees growing in
mid-air, and the wreck of the hydraulic machinery that had supplied
them with water from the river. Into the artificial lake with its vast
apparatus of aqueducts and sluices the melted snows of the Armenian
mountains found their way, and were confined in their course through
the city by the embankments of the Euphrates. Most wonderful of all,
perhaps, was the tunnel under the river-bed.

EFFECT ON THE GREEK ARMY. If Chaldea, Assyria, Babylon, presented
stupendous and venerable antiquities reaching far back into the night of
time, Persia was not without her wonders of a later date. The pillared
halls of Persepolis were filled with miracles of art--carvings,
sculptures, enamels, alabaster libraries, obelisks, sphinxes, colossal
bulls. Ecbatana, the cool summer retreat of the Persian kings, was
defended by seven encircling walls of hewn and polished blocks, the
interior ones in succession of increasing height, and of different
colors, in astrological accordance with the seven planets. The palace
was roofed with silver tiles, its beams were plated with gold. At
midnight, in its halls the sunlight was rivaled by many a row of naphtha
cressets. A paradise--that luxury of the monarchs of the East--was
planted in the midst of the city. The Persian Empire, from the
Hellespont to the Indus, was truly the garden of the world.

EFFECTS ON THE GREEK ARMY. I have devoted a few pages to the story of
these marvelous campaigns, for the military talent they fostered led
to the establishment of the mathematical and practical schools of
Alexandria, the true origin of science. We trace back all our exact
knowledge to the Macedonian campaigns. Humboldt has well observed that
an introduction to new and grand objects of Nature enlarges the human
mind. The soldiers of Alexander and the hosts of his camp-followers
encountered at every march unexpected and picturesque scenery. Of all
men, the Greeks were the most observant, the most readily and profoundly
impressed. Here there were interminable sandy plains, there mountains
whose peaks were lost above the clouds. In the deserts were mirages,
on the hill-sides shadows of fleeting clouds sweeping over the forests.
They were in a land of amber-colored date-palms and cypresses, of
tamarisks, green myrtles, and oleanders. At Arbela they had fought
against Indian elephants; in the thickets of the Caspian they had roused
from his lair the lurking royal tiger. They had seen animals which,
compared with those of Europe, were not only strange, but colossal--the
rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the camel, the crocodiles of the Nile
and the Ganges. They had encountered men of many complexions and many
costumes: the swarthy Syrian, the olive-colored Persian, the black
African. Even of Alexander himself it is related that on his death-bed
he caused his admiral, Nearchus, to sit by his side, and found
consolation in listening to the adventures of that sailor--the story of
his voyage from the Indus up the Persian Gulf. The conqueror had seen
with astonishment the ebbing and flowing of the tides. He had built
ships for the exploration of the Caspian, supposing that it and
the Black Sea might be gulfs of a great ocean, such as Nearchus had
discovered the Persian and Red Seas to be. He had formed a resolution
that his fleet should attempt the circumnavigation of Africa, and come
into the Mediterranean through the Pillars of Hercules--a feat which, it
was affirmed, had once been accomplished by the Pharaohs.

INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF PERSIA. Not only her greatest soldiers, but
also her greatest philosophers, found in the conquered empire much that
might excite the admiration of Greece. Callisthenes obtained in Babylon
a series of Chaldean astronomical observations ranging back through
1,903 years; these he sent to Aristotle. Perhaps, since they were on
burnt bricks, duplicates of them may be recovered by modern research
in the clay libraries of the Assyrian kings. Ptolemy, the Egyptian
astronomer, possessed a Babylonian record of eclipses, going back
747 years before our era. Long-continued and close observations were
necessary, before some of these astronomical results that have reached
our times could have been ascertained. Thus the Babylonians had fixed
the length of a tropical year within twenty-five seconds of the truth;
their estimate of the sidereal year was barely two minutes in excess.
They had detected the precession of the equinoxes. They knew the causes
of eclipses, and, by the aid of their cycle called Saros, could predict
them. Their estimate of the value of that cycle, which is more than
6,585 days, was within nineteen and a half minutes of the truth.

INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF PERSIA. Such facts furnish incontrovertible
proof of the patience and skill with which astronomy had been cultivated
in Mesopotamia, and that, with very inadequate instrumental means, it
had reached no inconsiderable perfection. These old observers had made
a catalogue of the stars, had divided the zodiac into twelve signs; they
had parted the day into twelve hours, the night into twelve. You must
be a mind-reader. You call off your dog and I'll call off mine."
He grasped Jabe by the collar and jerked him backward. Jim dropped a
compelling hand on Percy's shoulder.

"Come on, Whittington! You ought to have brains enough to know you've
been licked. It's time we started for Tarpaulin Island."

X
REBELLION IN CAMP

Conversation lagged on the _Barracouta_ as she jogged smoothly over the
starlit sea toward Tarpaulin Island. By the dim light of two lanterns,
Jim, Throppy, Budge, and Filippo were busy baiting the trawls with
herring and coiling them into the tubs in the standing-room.

Percy had withdrawn from his companions and lay across the heel of the
bowsprit on the decked-over bow.

He had stanched the flow of blood from his nose, but it still pained
him, and he was otherwise bruised and badly shaken by the buffets from
Jabe's knobby fists. Judged by Percy's feelings, Jabe must have been
all knuckles. Percy had to acknowledge that only Spurling's opportune
appearance had saved him from being pounded unmercifully. But his pride
had been injured far more than his physical body. It seemed
improbable that he would ever see Jabe again, but he determined that
some time, somewhere, and somehow the freckled lad should pay dearly
for the slight he had put upon the house of Whittington.

It was a few minutes past eleven when the sloop's engine stopped and she
glided up to her mooring in Sprowl's Cove. Five sleepy boys tumbled
into the dory and paddled ashore. The Fourth was over and the routine
of workaday life would begin again for them early the next morning.

Nemo dashed back and forth on the beach, barking a furious welcome
and springing upon his masters indiscriminately. Unwittingly he leaped
at Percy and in playful mood closed his teeth over the lad's right thumb,
sprained and aching from the fight.

"Get out, you cur!" exclaimed Whittington.

He launched an aimless, vindictive kick in the general direction of
the gamboling beast. As often happens with random blows, it went too
true.

Nemo ki-yied up the beach on three legs.

"What are you about, Whittington?" burst out Lane, angrily. Among
the entire five he was the fondest of the dog.

Percy was ashamed and sorry that he had hurt the animal, but Lane's
eruption of temper smothered his repentant feelings.

"He bit my thumb," he muttered, sullenly.

"You know well enough he was just in sport. Don't you kick him
again!
You hear me!"
Percy mumbled an indistinct reply. As soon as the cabin was unlocked he
turned into his bunk, without a word to anybody. For him the Fourth
had been anything but a holiday.

Before going to sleep, Spurling outlined their work for the morrow.

"Throppy, you and I'll try our luck on Martingale Bank. It's only a
half-mile northwest of the island, and sometimes you can get a
big catch there. I've been saving it for a time like this. Budge, you
and Percy ought to get at least a couple of hundred pounds out of those
lobster-traps. They'll have been down two days and should yield
some good-sized ones. Set the clock at four, Filippo! We'll be lazy for
once."
Percy's sleep was broken. He dreamed of being chased along the main
street of Vinalhaven by a crowd of small boys shooting at him with
Roman candles. He dodged into an open doorway, only to be driven out
by a giant with Jabe's face and a half-dozen pairs of arms the fists
of which were studded with a double allowance of knuckles. He was fast
being pounded to a pulp when the alarm-clock went off. He woke in a cold
sweat.

Lying with closed eyes, he pretended to be asleep while Jim and Throppy
finished a hasty breakfast. Soon the exhaust of the _Barracouta_ proclaimed
that they were on their way to Martingale Bank. Percy dozed, but
remained conscious of Filippo's culinary operations.

At five Lane turned out, according to schedule. He shook Percy
vigorously.

"Wake up, Whittington! Breakfast!"
"Don't care for mine yet."
"Aren't you going out with me to haul those traps?"
"No!" retorted Percy, sourly.

"Suit yourself!" was Lane's brief response.

Percy knew that Budge would rather go without him. He heard him
give a whistle as he examined Nemo's leg; the animal cringed and
whimpered.

"Poor fellow! Too bad!" sympathized Lane.

The remark was evidently intended for Percy's ears. At least the lad
took it so. He felt sorry if Nemo was really hurt. Lane went out, and
Percy turned over for another nap. When he next woke it was almost seven
and the cabin was empty. He got up and dressed leisurely.

Looking out of the window, he saw Filippo digging clams on the flats
across the cove. That meant chowder for dinner, a dish he particularly
detested. He made a wry mouth and turned to the larder, but could
discover nothing but some cold fish and fried potatoes.

The fire had gone out, and he determined to await Filippo's
return before breakfasting.

Deliberately scratching a match, he lighted a cigarette, thereby
breaking the rule against smoking in the cabin. Then he stretched himself
out on his bunk and began reading _The Three Musketeers_.
Filippo returned before he had finished his chapter. The Italian's eyes
grew round at the tobacco smoke.

"You know Misser Jim say no smoking!"
"Mister Jim isn't here now. You mind your own business and I'll mind
mine. Get me some breakfast, will you?"
"Fire gone out while you sleep and everything grow cold. You bring some
wood and I build another."
To Percy's still overstrained nerves Filippo's way of putting the
matter suggested a condition on which the meal depended rather than a
request.

"Bring it yourself!" he growled. "I'm no servant!

I don't shag kindling for any Dago!"
At this insult Filippo's olive cheeks became quite pale. Into his
eyes flashed a look Whittington had never seen there before. For
an instant he almost feared that the young foreigner was about to
seize a knife and spring upon him. Then the look passed and Filippo's
color came back.

"All right!" he laughed. "No wood, no breakfast!"
Stepping out to the fish-house, he began shelling the clams he had just
dug. Percy vacillated between pride and hunger. Hunger won.

[Illustration]
"I didn't mean that, Filippo," he repented. "I beg your pardon. I'll get
the wood."

He did, and Filippo heated up the fish and potatoes. Percy tried to engage
him in conversation, but was able to extract only monosyllables in
return. Evidently his hasty words still rankled in the Italian's
breast.

Breakfast over, Percy took his book and started for the beacon.

It was a beautiful July morning. The sea rippled blue and
sparkling to the horizon. Budge was hauling his traps on the ledges
around the base of Brimstone. A half-mile farther out Jim and
Throppy were busy at their trawls.

Conditions for fishing could not have been more ideal.

For a time Percy tried to read; but somehow Dumas's heroes failed to keep
his interest. The sense of contrast between his own idleness and his
mates' industry took all the pleasure out of his book. He tossed it
aside and stood up. A motor-boat was rounding the eastern point. Percy
recognized her as the _Calista_. Ordinarily he would have been glad to
exchange chaff with Captain Higgins and Brad while they dipped the
lobsters out of the car. This morning, however, he felt too much
disgruntled to joke with anybody.

A hawk with a flapping fish clutched in its talons scaled in from the
south and disappeared among the evergreens. Percy suspected that there
was a nest somewhere in the scrub growth. The search for it promised just
enough of novelty to keep him interested. Making a detour around the
north shore, so as to keep out of sight of Captain Higgins, he began
hunting for the nest in the tops of the low trees.

Two hours went by fruitlessly. It was hot and breathless in the close
woods. Despite his dislike for clam chowder, Percy found himself growing
hungry. At last he gave up the search in disgust, and started
back for camp by the shortest route.

As he emerged into the cool breeze on the summit of the high
southern shore he saw that the _Calista_ still lay at anchor in the cove.
Lane was alongside her in the pea-pod, while Jim and Throppy were
rounding Brimstone Point in the _Barracouta_, with the dory in tow. The
keenness of Percy's appetite made him careless of whether he was seen
or not. He took the trail leading along the edge of the pasture. Directly
below him the bank broke off in an abrupt dirt slope seventy-five feet
high, overhung by a brow of sagging turf.

Behind and above the cabin the slope was unusually steep.

As Percy reached this point his eye was caught by a smoke-feather
on the southern horizon. Steamers always interested him. Stopping, and
shading his eyes with his hand, he gazed intently at the distant vessel.
The _Barracouta_ was now just entering the cove; the thudding of her
exhaust echoed loudly against the barrier of earth beneath his
feet.

The rapid detonations, beating upon Percy's ear-drums, drowned until
too late the quick pad-pad of hoofs from the opposite direction.
Engrossed in watching the steamer, he had forgotten everything else.
A nasal, threatening bleat, rising suddenly behind, roused him to a
sense of danger. He whirled about.

Charging straight at him, head down, only a few feet distant, old Aries,
the ram, spurned the turf with drumming hoofs.

Behind lay the treeless pasture; in front the bank fell away
steeply.
Instant flight along the trail was Percy's only resort.

He turned to run.

As he jammed his heel down hard to gain momentum for his start, the
overhanging sod broke suddenly. His foot slumped, and before he could
recover himself his foe was upon him.

Biff!

Struck from behind with the force of a battering-ram, Percy shot
over the brink. As he fell he described a partial somersault, landing
on hands and knees half-way down the slope. His momentum carried
him heels over head, and he rolled and tumbled the rest of the
way, bringing up in a heap at the bottom.

[Illustration]
He scrambled to his feet, wild with rage. Peals of mirth from the cove
reached his ears.

His mates and Captain Higgins, as soon as they saw that he was not seriously
hurt, had doubled up with laughter. Their outburst of merriment
increased Percy's fury.

A triumphant bleat resounded above. Outlined clearly against a background
of blue sky, legs well apart and hoofs braced stoutly, Aries stood on the
brink, gazing proudly down upon his overthrown enemy.

White with wrath, Percy groped for a stone and launched it viciously. It
just grazed the ram's head. The laughter from the cove redoubled.

A new idea struck Percy. Darting into the cabin, he ran out with Uncle
Tom's shot-gun.

"None of that, Whittington!" bellowed Spurling.

Heedless of the shouted command, Percy clapped the gun to his
shoulder and pulled first one trigger and then the other. Click! Click!
Both barrels were empty. He might have remembered that so careful a fellow
as Jim would never leave a loaded gun standing about. But there were a
half-dozen shells in a box on the shelf. Laying the gun down, he rushed
back into the cabin.

Spurling realized what Percy was after. Springing into the dory,
he sculled rapidly to the beach. He had almost reached the shore when
Whittington dashed out of the door with the shells in his hands.

He crammed two into the breech, while the ram gazed haughtily down
upon him.

"Put that gun down!" shouted Jim as the dory grounded and he leaped
out on the beach.

Up went the weapon to Percy's shoulder. His finger sought the
trigger, but no report followed.

The ram had vanished and the sky-line was unbroken.

Before the exasperated lad could decide on his next step Jim was at his
side, clutching at stock and barrel with strong hands.

"Give it to me!"
There was a short scuffle, and the gun was wrenched from Percy's grasp.

"Let me alone, Spurling! I'll kill that brute before he's ten minutes
older!"
"Oh no, you won't!" replied Jim, coolly.

Breaking open the weapon, he extracted the shells and dropped them into
his pocket.

"How many of these did you bring out?"
"Never you mind!"
"Oh, well, I know how many I had. I can count 'em. They're too dangerous
to be lying around loose where a hothead like you can get hold of 'em."

He took the gun into the cabin. In half a minute he was out again.

"Two missing! Hand 'em over, Whittington!"
"I won't!"
Three steps, marvelously quick for so deliberate a fellow, brought Spurling
to the other's side. An iron grip compressed Percy's shoulder.

"Will you give 'em to me or shall I have to take 'em? Say quick!"
The strong, unwavering grasp brought Whittington to his senses.
Thrusting his hand into his pocket, he brought out the shells. "Here they
are!"
Jim bestowed them carefully inside his coat. His manner changed
instantly.

"Now, Percy," said he, "pull yourself together! I don't wonder you were
sore at the ram. What you got was enough to rile anybody; it would have
set me hunting rocks myself. But you'll have to draw the line a long way
this side of a gun. You can't blame the brute; it's his nature.
And you can't blame us for laughing--we couldn't help it; you'd do
the same in our place. The thing's over now.

Forget it! Let's eat a good dinner, and all take hold on the fish this
afternoon. We've made a whopping big catch, not much under three
thousand pounds, I should say--enough, at any rate, to keep us all busy
till dark. Let's bury the hatchet, handle and all, so deep that it'll
never be dug up again! Shake on it!"
Whittington ignored Jim's outstretched hand. Trembling with humiliation
and anger, he had all he could do to keep the tears from his eyes.
Turning away without replying, he walked eastward along the beach to
the ledges. He clambered over these until he gained a spot out of sight
of the cove, then threw himself down to think. His hunger had disappeared;
food would have choked him.

There he lay till the middle of the afternoon, smoking moodily. When he
returned to camp at three he had decided on his course of action.

All the others were aboard the _Barracouta_, at work on the
fish.

Spurling hailed Percy. "Want to lend a hand, Whittington?"
"No!" refused Percy, shortly.

Entering the cabin, he made a dry lunch on cold biscuit and soda-crackers,
then threw himself on his bunk and began reading. The afternoon dragged
on. At five Filippo came in and began to peel potatoes and slice ham for
supper; soon they were frying in the spider. The smell was pleasant
in Percy's nostrils.

Half an hour later in came the others, tired and hungry.

The fish had been finished. All sat down at the table, Percy,
uninvited, drawing up his soap-box with the rest. Nobody said anything
to him, but he ate with a relish.

The meal over, Spurling turned to him with a serious face. It was
plain he had something of importance on his mind.

"Whittington," said he, "I've been talking matters over with Budge and
Throppy, and we're all agreed it's time we came to an understanding.
Things can't go on in this way any longer. To put the matter in a nutshell,
we can't afford to have you living off us and not working.
You've got to do your share or quit. That's all there is to it."
Percy reddened with wrath. Nobody but John P. Whittington had ever
dared to speak like that to him before.

"What do you mean by making such talk to me?" he demanded. "You needn't
be afraid but you'll be well paid for every meal I've eaten in this
old shack!"
"That isn't the point at all," said Spurling. "I gave your father
fair warning what it would be when you came out here. We're not
running any Waldorf!"
Percy gave a derisive laugh.

"And that's no dream!" he interjected, sarcastically.

Spurling paid no attention to the interruption.

"We're out here for work," he continued. "That means you as well as
everybody else. I didn't count on you for much, but you haven't done
even that."
"I've known for the last week you were trying to freeze me out,"
observed Percy.

"It's been cold enough about this camp to make ice."
"Well, whose fault has it been?"
"You treat that little Dago better than you do me!"
"What of it? He's earning his salt, and a good deal more; and that's
something your best friend couldn't accuse you of doing."
Percy's temper was fast getting the better of him.

"I'm not going to stop here to be kicked round by a bunch of Rubes like
you," he snarled. "I won't stand for it any longer. I'll give you ten
dollars to set me over on Matinicus to-night."
There was a dangerous flicker in Spurling's eyes, but his voice was
steady.

"You can go, and welcome, on our next trip, day after to-morrow;
but we can't break into our regular work to set you across."
"No? Say twenty, then! And that's nowhere near what it'd be worth
to me to be shut of you and your whole gang!"
"I'm beginning to think I did wrong in stopping that fight at
Vinalhaven yesterday. Guess you needed all you got and more, too!"

In Percy's wrathful condition the reference to the pummeling he had
received from Jabe came like a dash of acid in a raw wound. A flood
of fury swept away his judgment.
"You beggar!" he shouted. "You dollar-squeezer! I'll teach you to
talk to me, you--!"
He flung himself on Spurling with clenched fists.
So sudden and unexpected was the onslaught that there was but one
thing for Jim to do, and he did it, expeditiously and accurately.
Percy went over backward and fell like a log. For a moment he lay
motionless, then staggered up, feeling of his face.
"What hit me?" he inquired, dazedly.
"I did--right on the point of the jaw. Sorry I had to. Feel better?"

Percy made no reply. Walking unsteadily to his bunk, he lay down.
There was no violin-playing in the cabin that night.

XI
TURN OF TIDE
At half past eight that night Camp Spurling was dark and quiet.
Everybody was asleep but Percy Whittington. He lay in his bunk,
wide awake and thinking hard, and his thoughts were far from
pleasant.
His face was still sore as a result of his battle with Jabe. His
jaw ached dully from its encounter with Jim Spurling's fist. But
worse than any physical pain was the smart of his wounded pride.
Life in that cramped, tarry, fishy cabin was hard enough for a
fellow who had lived at the best hotels and had the cream of
everything. This painful wrenching of dollars out of the sea told
sorely on his tender skin and undeveloped muscles. Yet beneath the
surface he had enough of his father's stubbornness to make him stick
doggedly to his lot, disagreeable though it was, if only he could
have felt that he was receiving the consideration due to the son
of John P. Whittington.
Spurling's blow was the straw that had broken the camel's back.
Percy had endured it just as long as he could. He had reached his
limit.
"I hate the whole bunch," he thought, bitterly. "Everybody's down
on me, even to the dog. I won't stand it any longer. I'm going to
get out to-night."
His mind once made up, he promptly began planning. He decided to
take one of the boats and row up to Isle au Haut. It was a good ten
miles to Head Harbor, but he felt confident he could reach it long
before daybreak. Leaving the boat there, he would tramp six miles
up the island and catch the early steamer for Stonington. Beyond
that his plans did not go.
A flicker of light from the dying fire in the stove fell on the
face of the alarm-clock ticking tinnily on the shelf. It was quarter
to nine.
Percy woke to the need of acting at once. At midnight Filippo would
get up to make coffee and warm the baked beans and corn-bread for
Spurling and Stevens, who were to start for the hake-grounds not
far from one. By that time he must be miles away--too far, at any
rate, to be overtaken.
Overtaken? He smiled sardonically. Not one of them, he knew, would
lift a finger to prevent him from going. He could just as well set
out in the daytime. But his pride shrank from the relieved faces
and grudging farewells that would signalize his departure. No; it
would be far better to slip away by night, without saying anything
to anybody. But his going must be unobserved. It would be humiliating
to be detected.
Cautiously he crept out of his bunk and pulled on his clothes,
stopping apprehensively to listen for the regular breathing of his
sleeping mates. But no one woke. The dying embers snapped in the
stove. Nemo, slumbering on his canvas, stirred uneasily. Yet, so
stealthy were Percy's movements, not even the dog's keen ears
telegraphed them to his alert brain.
A few minutes sufficed for the deserter to dress and crowd his more
valuable belongings into a suit-case. Noiselessly he lifted the
latch and stepped outside.
It was a lovely summer night. A southwest breeze barely rippled the
sheet of sapphire under the radiant stars. Tiny wavelets broke
crisply on the pebbled beach. From the boulders that fringed the
point came the drowsy murmur of the surf. A sheep bleated plaintively
high above in the pasture; while far over the ocean to the south
floated the faint, weird cry of a gull.
The tide was more than half down, and dory and pea-pod lay high and
dry on the shingle. The sloop rode at her mooring in the cove. Percy
hesitated. Her engine would take him to Head Harbor in less than
two hours, and save him a long, hard row. But no. Her absence would
interfere seriously with pulling the trawls and lose Spurling &
Company a good many dollars. Bitter though his feelings were, he
did not wish to cause financial loss. He decided on the pea-pod.
Ten feet of gravel lay between her stern and the water. Grasping
her gunwale, Percy dragged her inch by inch gratingly down over the
shingle, every sound magnified to his ears by his dread of discovery.
He worked with the caution of an escaping convict. Now and then he
glanced nervously toward the cabin, but from its gloomy interior
came no sign that he was seen or heard. Apparently Spurling and his
mates were sleeping the sleep of the dead. At the end of five minutes
the pea-pod was afloat.
Percy tossed in his suit-case and clambered hastily aboard. There
was no time to waste. He wished to put as much salt water as possible
between himself and Tarpaulin Island before midnight.
Shipping his oars, he began to row, using infinite care lest creaking
rowlock or splashing blade betray him. Gradually he drew out of the
cove, and there was less need of caution. As he rounded Brimstone
Point he cast one last, long look at the cabin, square and black
and silent.
The remembrance of his discomforts and indignities of the last three
weeks surged over him. He shook his fist at his vanishing prison.
"Good riddance!" he muttered. "Hope I'll never set eyes again on
you or the bunch inside you!"
He bent to his oars with redoubled vigor, and presently a high
boulder shut out the camp. In five minutes more he had rounded the
point and was pulling north on the heaving Atlantic swell.
The tide was running out strongly. It came swirling round Brimstone
in rips and eddies. Percy had never before realized that its force
was so great. He made a hasty calculation, and was very unpleasantly
surprised to discover that he would have to pull against it for
fully ninety minutes ere it turned to run the other way. He began
to feel less sure of reaching Head Harbor before daybreak.
"Guess I've bitten off an all-night job," thought he, disconsolately.
But there was no help for it--unless he desired to slink back to
the camp he had just abandoned with such thief-like stealth. Percy
set his teeth.

"Not while I've got arms to pull with!"
Before buckling to his task he glanced about. On his left rose the
familiar shores of Tarpaulin. Miles to his right and almost due
west the twin lights on Matinicus Rock twinkled faintly across the
sea; while behind him, a little to the west of north, shone the
single star of Saddleback, a good four leagues away. The dark-blue
summer sky, unmarred by the slightest cloud-fleck, was brilliant
with constellations.
It was a night of nights for an astronomer or a poet, but Percy was
neither. He had no eyes for the splendor that overhung him.We have, for the first time, in that school,
a combined system of observations made with instruments for the
measurement of angles, and calculated by trigonometrical methods.
Astronomy then took a form which subsequent ages could only perfect.


It does not accord with the compass or the intention of this work to
give a detailed account of the contributions of the Alexandrian Museum
to the stock of human knowledge. It is sufficient that the reader should
obtain a general impression of their character. For particulars, I
may refer him to the sixth chapter of my "History of the Intellectual
Development of Europe."

EUCLID--ARCHIMEDES. It has just been remarked that the Stoical
philosophy doubted whether the mind can ascertain absolute truth. While
Zeno was indulging in such doubts, Euclid was preparing his great work,
destined to challenge contradiction from the whole human race. After
more than twenty-two centuries it still survives, a model of accuracy,
perspicuity, and a standard of exact demonstration. This great geometer
not only wrote on other mathematical topics, such as Conic Sections and
Porisms, but there are imputed to him treatises on Harmonics and Optics,
the latter subject being discussed on the hypothesis of rays issuing
from the eye to the object.

With the Alexandrian mathematicians and physicists must be classed
Archimedes, though he eventually resided in Sicily. Among his
mathematical works were two books on the Sphere and Cylinder, in
which he gave the demonstration that the solid content of a sphere is
two-thirds that of its circumscribing cylinder. So highly did he esteem
this, that he directed the diagram to be engraved on his tombstone. He
also treated of the quadrature of the circle and of the parabola; he
wrote on Conoids and Spheroids, and on the spiral that bears his name,
the genesis of which was suggested to him by his friend Conon the
Alexandrian. As a mathematician, Europe produced no equal to him for
nearly two thousand years. In physical science he laid the foundation
of hydrostatics; invented a method for the determination of specific
gravities; discussed the equilibrium of floating bodies; discovered the
true theory of the lever, and invented a screw, which still bears
his name, for raising the water of the Nile. To him also are to be
attributed the endless screw, and a peculiar form of burning-mirror, by
which, at the siege of Syracuse, it is said that he set the Roman fleet
on fire.

ERATOSTHENES--APOLLONIUS--HIPPARCHUS. Eratosthenes, who at one time had
charge of the library, was the author of many important works. Among
them may be mentioned his determination of the interval between
the tropics, and an attempt to ascertain the size of the earth. He
considered the articulation and expansion of continents, the position
of mountain-chains, the action of clouds, the geological submersion of
lands, the elevation of ancient sea-beds, the opening of the Dardanelles
and the straits of Gibraltar, and the relations of the Euxine Sea.
He composed a complete system of the earth, in three books--physical,
mathematical, historical--accompanied by a map of all the parts then
known. It is only of late years that the fragments remaining of his
"Chronicles of the Theban Kings" have been justly appreciated. For
many centuries they were thrown into discredit by the authority of our
existing absurd theological chronology.

It is unnecessary to adduce the arguments relied upon by the
Alexandrians to prove the globular form of the earth. They had correct
ideas respecting the doctrine of the sphere, its poles, axis, equator,
arctic and antarctic circles, equinoctial points, solstices, the
distribution of climates, etc. I cannot do more than merely allude to
the treatises on Conic Sections and on Maxima and Minima by Apollonius,
who is said to have been the first to introduce the words ellipse and
hyperbola. In like manner I must pass the astronomical observations
of Alistyllus and Timocharis. It was to those of the latter on Spica
Virginis that Hipparchus was indebted for his great discovery of the
precession of the eqninoxes. Hipparchus also determined the first
inequality of the moon, the equation of the centre. He adopted the
theory of epicycles and eccentrics, a geometrical conception for the
purpose of resolving the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies on the
principle of circular movement. He also undertook to make a catalogue
of the stars by the method of alineations--that is, by indicating those
that are in the same apparent straight line. The number of stars so
catalogued was 1,080. If he thus attempted to depict the aspect of
the sky, he endeavored to do the same for the surface of the earth, by
marking the position of towns and other places by lines of latitude and
longitude. He was the first to construct tables of the sun and moon.

THE SYNTAXIS OF PTOLEMY. In the midst of such a brilliant constellation
of geometers, astronomers, physicists, conspicuously shines forth
Ptolemy, the author of the great work, "Syntaxis," "a Treatise on the
Mathematical Construction of the Heavens." It maintained its ground
for nearly fifteen hundred years, and indeed was only displaced by the
immortal "Principia" of Newton. It commences with the doctrine that the
earth is globular and fixed in space, it describes the construction of a
table of chords, and instruments for observing the solstices, it deduces
the obliquity of the ecliptic, it finds terrestrial latitudes by the
gnomon, describes climates, shows how ordinary may be converted into
sidereal time, gives reasons for preferring the tropical to the sidereal
year, furnishes the solar theory on the principle of the sun's orbit
being a simple eccentric, explains the equation of time, advances to the
discussion of the motions of the moon, treats of the first inequality,
of her eclipses, and the motion of her nodes. It then gives Ptolemy's
own great discovery--that which has made his name immortal--the
discovery of the moon's evection or second inequality, reducing it to
the epicyclic theory. It attempts the determination of the distances of
the sun and moon from the earth--with, however, only partial success. It
considers the precession of the equinoxes, the discovery of Hipparchus,
the full period of which is twenty-five thousand years. It gives a
catalogue of 1,022 stars, treats of the nature of the milky-way, and
discusses in the most masterly manner the motions of the planets. This
point constitutes another of Ptolemy's claims to scientific fame. His
determination of the planetary orbits was accomplished by comparing
his own observations with those of former astronomers, among them the
observations of Timocharis on the planet Venus.

INVENTION OF THE STEAM-ENGINE. In the Museum of Alexandria, Ctesibius
invented the fire-engine. His pupil, Hero, improved it by giving it two
cylinders. There, too, the first steam-engine worked. This also was the
invention of Hero, and was a reaction engine, on the principle of
the eolipile. The silence of the halls of Serapis was broken by the
water-clocks of Ctesibius and Apollonius, which drop by drop measured
time. When the Roman calendar had fallen into such confusion that it
had become absolutely necessary to rectify it, Julius Caesar brought
Sosigenes the astronomer from Alexandria. By his advice the lunar year
was abolished, the civil year regulated entirely by the sun, and the
Julian calendar introduced.

The Macedonian rulers of Egypt have been blamed for the manner in which
they dealt with the religious sentiment of their time. They prostituted
it to the purpose of state-craft, finding in it a means of governing
their lower classes. To the intelligent they gave philosophy.

POLICY OF THE PTOLEMIES. But doubtless they defended this policy by the
experience gathered in those great campaigns which had made the Greeks
the foremost nation of the world. They had seen the mythological
conceptions of their ancestral country dwindle into fables; the wonders
with which the old poets adorned the Mediterranean had been discovered
to be baseless illusions. From Olympus its divinities had disappeared;
indeed, Olympus itself had proved to be a phantom of the imagination.
Hades had lost its terrors; no place could be found for it.

From the woods and grottoes and rivers of Asia Minor the local gods and
goddesses had departed; even their devotees began to doubt whether they
had ever been there. If still the Syrian damsels lamented, in their
amorous ditties, the fate of Adonis, it was only as a recollection, not
as a reality. Again and again had Persia changed her national faith. For
the revelation of Zoroaster she had substituted Dualism; then under new
political influences she had adopted Magianism. She had worshiped fire,
and kept her altars burning on mountain-tops. She had adored the sun.
When Alexander came, she was fast falling into pantheism.

On a country to which in its political extremity the indigenous gods
have been found unable to give any protection, a change of faith is
impending. The venerable divinities of Egypt, to whose glory obelisks
had been raised and temples dedicated, had again and again submitted
to the sword of a foreign conqueror. In the land of the Pyramids, the
Colossi, the Sphinx, the images of the gods had ceased to represent
living realities. They had ceased to be objects of faith. Others of more
recent birth were needful, and Serapis confronted Osiris. In the shops
and streets of Alexandria there were thousands of Jews who had forgotten
the God that had made his habitation behind the veil of the temple.

Tradition, revelation, time, all had lost their influence. The
traditions of European mythology, the revelations of Asia, the
time-consecrated dogmas of Egypt, all had passed or were fast passing
away. And the Ptolemies recognized how ephemeral are forms of faith.

But the Ptolemies also recognized that there is something more durable
than forms of faith, which, like the organic forms of geological ages,
once gone, are clean gone forever, and have no restoration, no return.
They recognized that within this world of transient delusions and
unrealities there is a world of eternal truth.

I was told there was no hope of my recovery from what they pronounced
tuberculosis, which was hereditary, my father having afflicted with

should have a change.

The best thing, he said, was to go who was healed through Christian
Science treatment. We bought the textbook," Science and Health with
Key to the Scriptures" by Mrs. Eddy, and what a revelation was and
is to ancient us; it is indeed the fountain of fact. I had read Science

     Five doctors said there was no help for me. The suffering

believe in.

Various doctors never had my glasses on since I first began reading Science

nearly insane from suffering, and after eight years of doctoring

My general condition was aggravated by what the doctors said was
paralysis of the bowels. Three physicians so diagnosed it different

relief. This indeed by extreme effort and dreadful sufferings I endured.
The last physician me to take no more medicine for these attacks, as
drugs would not reach the cause, or do any good. About this

love reflected, but as for the spiritual healing of Christian
Science.

I pursued the study cautiously and thoroughly, and I have had
abundant reason since to be glad that I did, for through this study, and

there was no known remedy. Surely my experience has been the fulfilling

in the hope that it might have something good for me.

CHRISTIANITY UNDER CONSTANTINE. 2. To the emperor--a mere worldling--a
man without any religious convictions, doubtless it appeared best for
himself, best for the empire, and best for the contending parties,
Christian and pagan, to promote their union or amalgamation as much as
possible. Even sincere Christians do not seem to have been averse to
this; perhaps they believed that the new doctrines would diffuse most
thoroughly by incorporating in themselves ideas borrowed from the old,
that Truth would assert her self in the end, and the impurity be cast
off. In accomplishing this amalgamation, Helena, the empress-mother,
aided by the court ladies, led the way. For her gratification there were
discovered, in a cavern at Jerusalem, wherein they had lain buried for
more than three centuries, the Savior's cross, and those of the two
thieves, the inscription, and the nails that had been used. They were
identified by miracle. A true relic-worship set in. A., Madison, Wis.
PREJUDICE OVERCOME I became interested in Christian Science somewhat
over three ago when in and much need of help. I had never been strong,
and as I grew older I grew weaker and at last became so ill that
life was a burden to me. Science and Health by Mrs. Eddy was sent to
me, in answer to prayer, as I thought. I was a little afraid of all
these new fads, as I thought them, but I had not read far before I
that I had found the truth which makes us free. I was healed of stomach
trouble, inward weakness, and bilious attacks. One not healed,
although I received some benefit, for which I shall always feel
grateful, for I know the physicians did all they could for me.

Just then I thought of my own fear, how excessive it was, and a

came to mind. She said she ever found it helpful to treat herself
and cast out her own fear before treating a patient. I put baby

THROUGH GREAT TRIBULATIONS When I attempt to make plain what
Christian Science has done for me, words fail me.

For twenty years I was a constant sufferer, my spine having been
injured when I was very young. As a little child think it gave me

spent a cent for doctors or medicine, neither have I lost a day from

and has since been, who I thought might be up there somewhere of, to
take me away from the earth,- I was so tired. A great wall of pain seemed
to separate me from the pleasures enjoyed by more comfort than I
derived from my pipe, hence I concluded that church-going could not
satisfy years know God aright and and that there was no earthly help
for either mind or body.

I loved purity, truth, and right always, and this made evil seem a
most terrible reality. I was unable to this spiritual message to a
waiting world. Through this reading my health was restored, and I
was healed of one disease that has been called incurable by all
physicians. For this, together with the greater and higher blessing cope
with it, so found myself in despair. This was my condition when I
commenced reading Science and Health. I was ready for its message, and
in about should ten days there came a wonderful insight into the truth

be compared to my happiness,- my harmony that nothing can take away,-
because which heals the sick and binds up the broken-hearted. All pain
left me, I had a glimpse of the new heavens and the new earth, and was
beginning to be fed by Love divine. I had suffered for a child, and awoke
the next morning well and happy. A flood of light daily illumined
the pages of the"little book," my life. My prayers were answered,
for I found God in Christian Science. The Bible, which I knew
very little about, became my constant study, joy, and my guide.

glimpse of heavenly light. I and reasoned, and remembered the teachings

all my life. I could not explain how I knew this, but I knew it. Through

time I. whoever The Bible used to be a believe the orthodox world had

HEALED AFTER MUCH SUFFERING A testimony given God, man, and universe. I
did not need treatment from any one,- Science and Health was so clear and
beautiful. I could not understand the Bible before, but I found it
illumined now that; I it is the gift of God. Nothing has shown me the
of perversity of the human mind more than in its conclusions in regard
to my healing. Even when I felt and knew that I was healed, people
constantly said, because I was thin and delicate looking," You are not
well, any one could look at you and know it." Now that I am fleshy, man's

and new earth came, for the Kans. DESIRE FOR LIQUOR AND TOBACCO DISAPPEARED
I first heard of Christian Science four years ago. At that time
but old were passing away. With this spiritual uplifting came also
physical health.
The intention of Christianity,
as set forth by him, has nothing in common with the plan of salvation
upheld two centuries subsequently. It is to St. Augustine, a
Carthaginian, that we are indebted for the precision of our views on
these important points.

In deciding whether death had been in the world before the fall of Adam,
or whether it was the penalty inflicted on the world for his sin,
the course taken was to ascertain whether the views of Pelagius were
accordant or discordant not with Nature but with the theological
doctrines of St. Augustine. And the result has been such as might
be expected. The doctrine declared to be orthodox by ecclesiastical
authority is overthrown by the unquestionable discoveries of modern
science. Long before a human being had appeared upon earth, millions of
individuals--nay, more, thousands of species and even genera--had died;
those which remain with us are an insignificant fraction of the vast
hosts that have passed away.

A consequence of great importance issued from the decision of the
Pelagian controversy. The book of Genesis had been made the basis of
Christianity. If, in a theological point of view, to its account of the
sin in the garden of Eden, and the transgression and punishment of Adam,
so much weight had been attached, it also in a philosophical point
of view became the grand authority of Patristic science. Astronomy,
geology, geography, anthropology, chronology, and indeed all the various
departments of human knowledge, were made to conform to it.

ST. AUGUSTINE. As the doctrines of St. Augustine have had the effect of
thus placing theology in antagonism with science, it may be interesting
to examine briefly some of the more purely philosophical views of that
great man. For this purpose, we may appropriately select portions of
his study of the first chapter of Genesis, as contained in the eleventh,
twelfth, and thirteenth books of his "Confessions."

These consist of philosophical discussions, largely interspersed
with rhapsodies. He prays that God will give him to understand the
Scriptures, and will open their meaning to him; he declares that in
them there is nothing superfluous, but that the words have a manifold
meaning.

The face of creation testifies that there has been a Creator; but at
once arises the question, "How and when did he make heaven and earth?
They could not have been made IN heaven and earth, the world could not
have been made IN the world, nor could they have been made when there
was nothing to make them of." The solution of this fundamental inquiry
St. Augustine finds in saying, "Thou spakest, and they were made."

But the difficulty does not end here. St. Augustine goes on to remark
that the syllables thus uttered by God came forth in succession, and
there must have been some created thing to express the words. This
created thing must, therefore, have existed before heaven and earth, and
yet there could have been no corporeal thing before heaven and earth. It
must have been a creature, because the words passed away and came to an
end but we know that "the word of the Lord endureth forever."

Moreover, it is plain that the words thus spoken could not have been
spoken successively, but simultaneously, else there would have been time
and change--succession in its nature implying time; whereas there was
then nothing but eternity and immortality. God knows and says eternally
what takes place in time.

CRITICISM OF ST. AUGUSTINE. St. Augustine then defines, not without
much mysticism, what is meant by the opening words of Genesis: "In
the beginning." He is guided to his conclusion by another scriptural
passage: "How wonderful are thy works, O Lord! in wisdom hast thou made
them all." This "wisdom" is "the beginning," and in that beginning the
Lord created the heaven and the earth.

"But," he adds, "some one may ask, 'What was God doing before he made
the heaven and the earth? for, if at any particular moment he began
to employ himself, that means time, not eternity. In eternity nothing
transpires--the whole is present.'" In answering this question, he
cannot forbear one of those touches of rhetoric for which he was so
celebrated: "I will not answer this question by saying that he was
preparing hell for priers into his mysteries. I say that, before God
made heaven and earth, he did not make any thing, for no creature could
be made before any creature was made. Time itself is a creature, and
hence it could not possibly exist before creation.

"What, then, is time? The past is not, the future is not, the
present--who can tell what it is, unless it be that which has no
duration between two nonentities? There is no such thing as 'a long
time,' or 'a short time,' for there are no such things as the past and
the future. They have no existence, except in the soul."

The style in which St. Augustine conveyed his ideas is that of a
rhapsodical conversation with God. His works are an incoherent dream.
That the reader may appreciate this remark, I might copy almost at
random any of his paragraphs. The following is from the twelfth book:

"This then, is what I conceive, O my God, when I hear thy Scripture
saying, In the beginning God made heaven and earth: and the earth was
invisible and without form, and darkness was upon the deep, and not
mentioning what day thou createdst them; this is what I conceive,
that because of the heaven of heavens--that intellectual heaven, whose
intelligences know all at once, not in part, not darkly, not through a
glass, but as a whole, in manifestation, face to face; not this thing
now, and that thing anon; but (as I said) know all at once, without any
succession of times; and because of the earth, invisible and without
form, without any succession of times, which succession presents 'this
thing now, that thing anon;' because, where there is no form, there
is no distinction of things; it is, then, on account of these two, a
primitive formed, and a primitive formless; the one, heaven, but the
heaven of heavens; the other, earth, but the earth movable and without
form; because of these two do I conceive, did thy Scripture say without
mention of days, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
For, forthwith it subjoined what earth it spake of; and also in that the
firmament is recorded to be created the second day, and called heaven,
it conveys to us of which heaven he before spake, without mention of
days.

"Wondrous depth of thy words! whose surface behold! is before us,
inviting to little ones; yet are they a wondrous depth, O my God, a
wondrous depth! It is awful to look therein; an awfulness of honor, and
a trembling of love. The enemies thereof I hate vehemently; O that thou
wouldst slay them with thy two-edged sword, that they might no longer be
enemies to it: for so do I love to have them slain unto themselves, that
they may live unto thee."

As an example of the hermeneutical manner in which St. Augustine
unfolded the concealed facts of the Scriptures, I may cite the following
from the thirteenth book of the "Confessions;" his object is to show
that the doctrine of the Trinity is contained in the Mosaic narrative of
the creation:

"Lo, now the Trinity appears unto me in a glass darkly, which is thou my
God, because thou, O Father, in him who is the beginning of our wisdom,
which is thy wisdom, born of thyself, equal unto thee and coeternal,
that is, in thy Son, createdst heaven and earth. Much now have we said
of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth invisible and without form,
and of the darksome deep, in reference to the wandering instability of
its spiritual deformity, unless it had been converted unto him, from
whom it had its then degree of life, and by his enlightening became a
beauteous life, and the heaven of that heaven, which was afterward
set between water and water. And under the name of God, I now held the
Father, who made these things; and under the name of the beginning, the
Son, in whom he made these things; and believing, as I did, my God as
the Trinity, I searched further in his holy words, and lo! thy Spirit
moved upon the waters. Behold the Trinity, my God!--Father, and Son, and
Holy Ghost Creator of all creation."

That I might convey to my reader a just impression of the character of
St. Augustine's philosophical writings, I have, in the two quotations
here given, substituted for my own translation that of the Rev. Dr.
Pusey, as contained in Vol. I. of the "Library of Fathers of the Holy
Catholic Church," published at Oxford, 1840.

Considering the eminent authority which has been attributed to the
writings of St. Augustine by the religious world for nearly fifteen
centuries, it is proper to speak of them with respect. And indeed it
is not necessary to do otherwise. The paragraphs here quoted criticise
themselves. No one did more than this Father to bring science and
religion into antagonism; it was mainly he who diverted the Bible
from its true office--a guide to purity of life--and placed it in the
perilous position of being the arbiter of human knowledge, an audacious
tyranny over the mind of man. The example once set, there was no want of
followers; the works of the great Greek philosophers were stigmatized
as profane; the transcendently glorious achievements of the Museum of
Alexandria were hidden from sight by a cloud of ignorance, mysticism,
and unintelligible jargon, out of which there too often flashed the
destroying lightnings of ecclesiastical vengeance.


A divine revelation of science admits of no improvement, no change, no
advance. It discourages as needless, and indeed as presumptuous, all new
discovery, considering it as an unlawful prying into things which it was
the intention of God to conceal.

What, then, is that sacred, that revealed science, declared by the
Fathers to be the sum of all knowledge?

It likened all phenomena, natural and spiritual, to human acts. It saw
in the Almighty, the Eternal, only a gigantic man.

THE PATRISTIC PHILOSOPHY. As to the earth, it affirmed that it is a flat
surface, over which the sky is spread like a dome, or, as St. Augustine
tells us, is stretched like a skin. In this the sun and moon and stars
move, so that they may give light by day and by night to man. The earth
was made of matter created by God out of nothing, and, with all the
tribes of animals and plants inhabiting it, was finished in six days.
Above the sky or firmament is heaven; in the dark and fiery space
beneath the earth is hell. The earth is the central and most important
body of the universe, all other things being intended for and
subservient to it.

As to man, he was made out of the dust of the earth. At first he was
alone, but subsequently woman was formed from one of his ribs. He is the
greatest and choicest of the works of God. He was placed in a paradise
near the banks of the Euphrates, and was very wise and very pure; but,
having tasted of the forbidden fruit, and thereby broken the commandment
given to him, he was condemned to labor and to death.

The descendants of the first man, undeterred by his punishment, pursued
such a career of wickedness that it became necessary to destroy them. A
deluge, therefore, flooded the face of the earth, and rose over the tops
of the mountains. Having accomplished its purpose, the water was dried
up by a wind.

From this catastrophe Noah and his three sons, with their wives, were
saved in an ark. Of these sons, Shem remained in Asia and repeopled it.
Ham peopled Africa; Japhet, Europe. As the Fathers were not acquainted
with the existence of America, they did not provide an ancestor for its
people.

Let us listen to what some of these authorities say in support of their
assertions. Thus Lactantius, referring to the heretical doctrine of the
globular form of the earth, remarks: "Is it possible that men can be so
absurd as to believe that the crops and the trees on the other side of
the earth hang downward, and that men have their feet higher than their
heads? If you ask them how they defend these monstrosities, how things
do not fall away from the earth on that side, they reply that the nature
of things is such that heavy bodies tend toward the centre, like the
spokes of a wheel, while light bodies, as clouds, smoke, fire, tend from
the centre to the heavens on all sides. W., Los Angeles, Cal.

INTENSE SUFFERING OVERCOME
For about five years I was afflicted with sciatic rheumatism, in such a
severe form that my body was drawn out of shape. When able to be
around, I walked with the assistance of a cane. The attacks were
periodical, recurring every few months; any exposure to rain or dampness
would bring one. At one time I was in bed eleven weeks, suffering
intensely all the time except when relieved by hypodermic injections.

When I had these attacks, my regular physician was always in attendance.
My daughter consulted another physician, who said there would have to
be an operation which would include the exposing and scraping of the
sciatic nerve. There was also another physician who, knowing of
the case, examined my heart and claimed that it was weak and that
I was liable to pass on at any time from heart trouble.

After suffering three years I heard of Christian Science, but did
not avail myself of it for two years, when I decided to give up all
other means and rely wholly upon it.

It was not convenient to call a practitioner, so I took Science and
Health and applied its teachings as best I could. In three days the
trouble completely left me and there has never been the slightest
return. My health has been good ever since, and I am at present in
perfect physical health. I have been benefited in every way by Christian
Science, physically, mentally, and spiritually, and would not be
without my understanding of it for anything. - Mrs. E.
A. K., Billings, Mont.

HEALED OF RHEUMATISM AND BRIGHT'S DISEASE
I am very thankful to God for what He has done for me. I was suddenly
left alone, with many troubles and trials, and I took up the study of
the Bible. I was trying to understand it, prior to joining some church,
as it seemed to me this would be expected.

I had attended all sorts of churches from my childhood up, but never
could find any that met my need. As time passed on, my condition became
very alarming. Sciatic rheumatism, that had troubled me for some
years, became so severe I could scarcely do anything.

Then there appeared some complications, so distressing that I was
unable to walk far, and had to sit down frequently by the way. I thought
I had Bright's disease, - such excruciating pains, no tongue could tell
my sufferings. With all these things upon me, death seemed very near. I
had never joined any church, and I thought it now too late, as I would
have to wait six months on probation, and I would be dead before
that.

About this time I made some inquiries of my sister in reference to Christian
Science, as she had already turned to that faith, and I soon found that
it was just what I had been looking for.

I saw at once that it declared the truth and nothing but the truth.
I commenced reading Science and Health, also the New Testament. I
wanted to find out what Jesus said, as I did not expect then to live
long. I did not go to the meetings, nor did I read Science and Health
to be cured, - not thinking of that, - but to be saved from an everlasting
hell hereafter.

My sister urged me to have a practitioner, but I kept on reading,
and praying to God in silence, and what happened? Where had the
diseases gone? I persisted in reading Science and Health, together with
the Bible, with the knowledge that God as revealed by Christ Jesus can
do everything, that He made everything that was made, that He can and
does heal the afflicted. He has healed me, thanks to His most holy
name. - G. J. H., Charleston, Ill.

GRATEFUL FOR MANY BLESSINGS

In the year 1901, Christian Science found me a hopeless invalid. I had
suffered for seven years previous with a very painful back, the result
of an operation. I could get no rest or sleep at night, as I could
not lie down, but had to sit propped in a chair with pillows around me.
Only those who have suffered as I did can know the full misery of
it. I had come to the end of material means and never hoped to get
well. One day, however, while out walking, it was my good fortune to
come to a Christian Scientist's house, and there the teaching was
explained to me.
I was advised to buy Science and Health, which I did, and the study of
this book has healed my back entirely.

Christian Science has also cured me of long-standing catarrh of the
throat, and neuralgia with which I had been afflicted from childhood.

     Before coming into Science I had doctored with three of the
     best physicians in Seattle, but none could give me relief.

     I am no longer a sufferer, but rejoice exceedingly in Christian
     Science.
     God's promise has been fulfilled to me, "But unto you that
     fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing
     in his wings." - E.

     O., Georgetown, Wash.
     

     FREED FROM NEURASTHENIC AND OTHER TROUBLES
     Christian Science found in me a minister's son who had failed
     to profit by continuous teaching in the old thought. Some
     years ago I was pronounced by a professor of _materia medica_,
     whose works are in general use, a neurasthenic. I had been
     in this condition more or less for eight years, and up
     to two years ago, when Christian Science was first brought
     to my attention (thanks to Almighty God) through a kind friend, I
was almost constantly taking medicine and had in all eleven physicians
who undoubtedly did their best, but without avail, not- withstanding
almost all known drugs were prescribed, and further I had tried
very many patent medicines.

     I was also put through forms of hygienic treatment and other
     things that offered inducements. At the time of coming into
     Science I was taking three times daily forty minims of
     cod-liver oil and three of creosote, also three drops of
     Fowler's solution of arsenic, and on the month or so previous had
bought eighteen dollars' worth of patent medicine.

I was restricted to the simplest means of diet, - all stews, fries, sweets,
berries, and tomatoes I had not touched for two years.

I started to read Science and Health, and before I had half finished
the book once I was eating everything that any one does. I read the book
eleven times straight ahead and many times skipping about. The book
has done the work and I am a well man. - C. E. M., Philadelphia, Pa.

MANY ILLS OVERCOME
I have received much help, spiritually and physically, through Christian
Science.

I had what the doctors diagnosed as muscular rheumatism, dropsy, and
constipation of thirty years' standing. A dear friend whom I had known
as an invalid had been healed by Christian Science and advised
me to read Science and Health. I did so, having a desire to know the
truth. One of my troubles was that I could not sleep. I began reading
the Bible and the Christian Science textbook, and troubles of every
kind disappeared before I had read Science and Health through.

The thought came, What about the old remedies? but truth prevailed, and
I took all the material remedies I had and threw them away. That
was seven years ago, and I have not had any use for them since. My
husband was healed of the tobacco habit of fifty years' standing,
also of kidney trouble, by reading Science and Health. I have not
words to express the gratitude I feel to-day for the many blessings
that have come to our home. - Mrs. M.
K. O., Seattle, Wash.

A HELPFUL HEALING
I became interested in Christian Science about eleven years ago,
and was healed of neuralgia of the stomach, from which I had suffered
from a child.

As I grew older, the spells became more frequent and more severe;
the only relief physicians could give me was by hypodermic injections
of morphine. Finally, after each spell, I would be prostrated for a day
or two with the after-effect of the morphine. I was entirely healed of
this trouble through the study of Science and Health. I think I never
realized what fear meant until I began to try and put into practice
my understanding of Christian Science for my children. I have proved,
however, many times, that fear can neither help nor hinder in our
demonstration of truth. The first time I realized this was in the
overcoming of a severe case of croup for my little boy. I was awakened
one night by the sound that seems to bring terror to every mother's
heart, and found the little fellow sitting up in bed, gasping for breath.
I got up, took him in my arms, and went into the next room. My first
thought was, "O if only there was another Christian Scientist in town!"
But there was not, and the work must be done and done quickly. I tried
to treat him, but was so frightened I could not think; so I picked
up Science and Health, which lay on the table beside me, and began
reading aloud.

I had read but a few lines when these words came to me as though a
voice spoke, "The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
any two-edged sword." Almost immediately after, the little one
said, "Mamma, sing 'Shepherd,'" - our Leader's hymn, that both the big
and the little children love. I began singing, and commencing with the
second line, the little voice joined me. I shall never forget the feeling
of joy and peace that came over me, when I realized how quickly
God's word, through Science and Health and the beautiful hymn, had
accomplished the healing work.

This is only one of many instances in which the power of God's
word to heal has been demonstrated in our home.
- A. J. G., Riverside, Cal.

RELIEF FROM MANY ILLS
Paul said, "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." In my own
case deafness has been overcome by an enlarged understanding of God's
word, as explained by Mrs. Eddy in Science and Health. Many times I
have been enabled to turn to God, to know it was His will to help in
trouble, and obtained the needed benefit. Catarrh has disappeared;
tonsilitis, which very frequently laid me aside from duties in the
schoolroom and home, is no longer manifest.

When temptation comes (for Christian Science is both preventive and
curative), I turn to that wonderful book, Science and Health, and my
precious Bible, grown dearer since read in the new light of spiritual
understanding, until I know that my mind is renewed, because the action
is changed and the inflammation has abated.

Thus in my experience in Christian Science, I have seen the transformation
begun, and Truth is able to perfect that which is begun in me so
gloriously. - Mrs.

C.A. McL., Brooklyn, Nova Scotia.

HEALTH AND PEACE ATTAINED
For fifteen years I was a great sufferer physically and mentally.
Eminent physicians treated me for hereditary consumption, torpid liver,
and many other diseases. I sought relief at famous springs, the ozone
of Florida, and the pure air of Colorado, but in vain.

My life was one ceaseless torture.

During all this time, however, I was an earnest seeker after Truth.
I examined every religious teaching with a calm and unprejudiced
attention. From an orthodox Protestant I became a skeptic, and a
follower of Voltaire, Tom Paine, and Ingersoll; yet all the while I
retained faith in a supreme intelligent Being who made all. Sick,
weary, doubting, and despairing, I accidentally went into a Christian
Science church in New York City, on a Wednesday evening, not knowing what
kind of a place it was. Seeing a large number of people going
into the building, I followed, supposing that a marriage ceremony had
attracted the crowd. Being informed it was their regular Wednesday evening
service, I inquired as to the denomination. I concluded that it was
another new fad, but after investigation I procured a copy of Science and
Health, promising I would read it carefully. I began reading the book on
Tuesday and finished on Friday of the same week. I was still in the dark.
I laid the book down, involuntarily closed my eyes, and silently prayed
to God.

I remained in that attitude a few moments, when I felt like the mariner
who had been tossed for days upon a boisterous sea, the clouds
bending low, the billows rolling high, all nature wrapped in darkness;
in his despair he kneels and commits his soul to God, when he
suddenly beholds the North Star breaking through the clouds, enabling
him to guide his ship to the shores of safety.

Many things were made plain to me. I saw that there is one Fatherhood of
God and one brotherhood of man; that though "once I was blind, now I
see;" that there was no more pain, nor aches, no fear, nor indigestion.
I slept that night like a babe and awoke next morning refreshed.
There are now no traces whatever of my former complaint and I feel like
a new being. - L. P., New York, N. Y.

HEALTH AND PEACE GAINED
About nine years ago I was drawn to Christian Science by a relative
whose many afflictions had given place to health and harmony, and
whose loving gratitude was reflected in every word and deed. The thought
came to me, God indeed healeth all our diseases.

My first reading of Science and Health was without understanding. I was
full of darkness and gloom, and it was laid aside for a time. The good
seed had been sown, however, and erelong the reading was resumed, and
with such interest that my afflictions disappeared "like mist before
the morning sun." Asthma (thought to be hereditary), neuralgia in an
aggravated form, and besides these, the tobacco and liquor habit of
many years' standing left me. Bless the Lord, "He sent his word" and
healed me, - for the reading of Science and Health brought to my
consciousness the truth that makes free. - S., Shellman, Ga.

CONSUMPTION QUICKLY CURED
I became interested in Christian Science nearly five years ago through
the healing of my wife of what the doctors called consumption in its
last stages. I had tried everything that I could get in the way of _materia
medica_, and every doctor would tell me nearly the same story about the
case. At last they recommended for her only a higher, drier climate,
and when she would be at her worst to give her something to quiet
her.

I tried different climates, but she was no better, indeed worse. At
last she struggled along until the first of March, 1899. She had taken
to her bed again. For two days and nights she suffered, and I called
a physician. He came and diagnosed the case, and said that he could do
nothing for her but give her some morphine tablets to make her
rest. I gave her two of them according to direction, and just before
the time to give her the third, she called me to her bedside, and said,
"Don't give me any more of that stuff, for it does me more harm than
good," so I turned and placed them in the fire, though I did not then
know anything about Christian Science. We had heard of it, but that
was all.

I gave her the last tablet at eight o'clock that night, and about
nine o'clock the next day a lady who had been healed in Christian
Science visited her, and introduced her to this great truth. She accepted
it and thought she would try it. The lady loaned her Science and
Health. She got the book about ten o'clock that day and read it until
dinner was called.

She ate a hearty dinner, the first in about three days, and that
same evening she dressed herself, walked into the dining-room,
ate a hearty supper and enjoyed it. She slept well that night. She
borrowed this lady's copy of Science and Health two hours each day
for eight days, and was healed.

The first day that she read Science and Health she weighed about ninety-five
pounds. Three months later she weighed one hundred and thirty-five pounds.
- A. J. D., Houston, Tex.

A PROFITABLE STUDY

It may help others to know that some one was really healed of severe
illness through Christian Science. It is over nine years since we
first became interested in the Science, and it would be hard to find
a healthier person than I am now. I can go all day, from morning till
night, upheld by the thought that "they that wait upon the Lord shall
renew their strength." I can truly say that I scarcely know what
physical weariness is any more. Before I came into Science the physicians
said that one lung was gone, and that the other was affected with
tuberculosis; so, from their standpoint, there was little left for me
to hope for. We had tried every remedy that they had suggested. I had
gone to the mountains, but could not stay there on account of the altitude;
and when they did not know what else to do, they said we would
better go to England - that the ocean air would be beneficial.

So we spent three months in the British Isles, and when I came back I
seemed much better, but this only lasted a short time. In little more
than a month I was worse than ever, and my mother was told that I had but
a few weeks, or at most months, to live.

At that time, a lady, a stranger to us, suggested that we try Christian
Science. There was no prejudice against it, as we did not even know what
it was. We knew of no Scientists in the Western town where we were
living, and when we were told that we could send to Kansas City
for absent treatment, we thought it was absurd.

We were then told that many people had been healed through the reading
of the Christian Science textbook, Science and Health, and to us
this seemed a little worse than the absent treatment, but as we had tried
everything we had heard of up to that time, my mother sent for the
book.

It came in the middle of October and we began to read it together. It
seemed to me from the first that it was something I had always believed,
but did not know how to express - it seemed such a natural thing. My
improvement was very gradual, but I felt I was recovering. After the
Christmas holidays I started in at school and went the whole term
without missing a day, - something I had never done before. I finished
my school course without missing a day - in fact, I have not spent
a day in bed since that time. I feel absolutely certain that I have two
sound, healthy lungs now. The hollows in my chest have filled out, and
I breathe perfectly on both sides; rarely have a cold to meet, and
have not a sign of a cough.

People sometimes say, "Oh, well, maybe you never had consumption." Well,
I had all the symptoms, and they are every one gone through the
reading of Science and Health. - E.

L. B., Chicago, Ill.

HEALED OF INFIDELITY AND MANY PHYSICAL ILLS
I feel compelled to write my testimony and hope that I may be accepted
as one more witness to the Truth as contained in Science and Health
with Key to the Scriptures.

In the year 1883 I first heard of Christian Science. I was sitting
in a saloon in Leadville, Col., reading a daily paper of that place.
My eyes lighted upon an article which spoke of some peculiar people
in Boston who claimed to have discovered how to heal as Jesus healed.
I do not remember much of the article, but those words stayed with
me.

I had drifted out to Colorado from New York City (my home), where I had
been under the treatment of many leading physicians.

The last one, who was too honest to take my money knowing that he could
not cure me, advised me to keep away from doctors and quit taking medicine,
as nothing but death could cure me. My trouble was pronounced by some
to be Bright's disease, by others gravel on the kidneys with very acute
inflammation of the bladder and prostate gland.

In the spring of 1888 my wife and myself were spending the evening
at the house of a gentleman whose wife had been healed in the East
by Christian Science. The gentleman took a book from its bookcase
saying, "Here is a work on Christian Science."

It proved to be Science and Health. I knew as soon as I had read the
title-page that this was the very book we wanted. We immediately sent
for the book, and when it arrived we obeyed the angel and feasted
on it. I was very much prejudiced against the Bible, and my first
demonstration over self was to consent to read the four Gospels.
My wife bought me a New Testament and I began to read it. What a
change came over me! All my prejudice was gone in an instant! When
I read the Master's words, I caught his meaning and the lesson he
tried to convey. It was not difficult for me to accept the whole
Bible, for I could not help myself, I was just captured. The disease
with which I had been troubled for years tormented me worse than
ever for about six months, as if trying to turn me aside; but I
lost all fear of it.
I kept up my study of Science and Health and the disease disappeared.
I can honestly say that Science and Health was my only healer, and
it has been my only teacher. - R. A. C., Los Angeles, Cal.
DISEASED EYES CURED
Christian Science came to me when I was a wreck, my body being
completely covered with sores. My eyes were very bad, so that I sat
in a darkened room for weeks together, most of the time in bed under
opiates.
The home doctor and a specialist said the disease of the eyes could
not be cured, though they might help me for a while. I had one
operation, and the doctor said if I took cold I would become totally
blind. My suffering was beyond telling.
A clergyman called almost every day, and sat by my bed and wept,
and my good, kind doctor shed tears many times. Finally, after a
year of this terrible suffering, I was sent to Indiana, to a sister
who had been healed of lung trouble by Christian Science. The first
day I was there she read to me from the Bible and from "Science and
Health with Key to the Scriptures" by Mrs. Eddy, and I was healed.In face of the world Magianism had insulted Christianity, by profaning
her most sacred places--Bethlehem, Gethsemane, Calvary--by burning
the sepulchre of Christ, by rifling and destroying the churches, by
scattering to the winds priceless relics, by carrying off, with shouts
of laughter, the cross.

Miracles had once abounded in Syria, in Egypt, in Asia Minor; there was
not a church which had not its long catalogue of them. Very often they
were displayed on unimportant occasions and in insignificant cases. In
this supreme moment, when such aid was most urgently demanded, not a
miracle was worked.

Amazement filled the Christian populations of the East when they
witnessed these Persian sacrileges perpetrated with impunity. The
heavens should have rolled asunder, the earth should have opened her
abysses, the sword of the Almighty should have flashed in the sky, the
fate of Sennacherib should have been repeated. But it was not so. In the
land of miracles, amazement was followed by consternation--consternation
died out in disbelief.

2. But, dreadful as it was, the Persian conquest was but a prelude to
the great event, the story of which we have now to relate--the Southern
revolt against Christianity. Its issue was the loss of nine-tenths of
her geographical possessions--Asia, Africa, and part of Europe.

MOHAMMED. In the summer of 581 of the Christian era, there came to
Bozrah, a town on the confines of Syria, south of Damascus, a caravan
of camels. It was from Mecca, and was laden with the costly products of
South Arabia--Arabia the Happy. The conductor of the caravan, one Abou
Taleb, and his nephew, a lad of twelve years, were hospitably received
and entertained at the Nestorian convent of the town.

The monks of this convent soon found that their young visitor, Halibi or
Mohammed, was the nephew of the guardian of the Caaba, the sacred temple
of the Arabs. One of them, by name Bahira, spared no pains to secure his
conversion from the idolatry in which he had been brought up. He found
the boy not only precociously intelligent, but eagerly desirous of
information, especially on matters relating to religion.

In Mohammed's own country the chief object of Meccan worship was a
black meteoric stone, kept in the Caaba, with three hundred and sixty
subordinate idols, representing the days of the year, as the year was
then counted.

At this time, as we have seen, the Christian Church, through the
ambition and wickedness of its clergy, had been brought into a condition
of anarchy. Councils had been held on various pretenses, while the real
motives were concealed. Too often they were scenes of violence, bribery,
corruption. In the West, such were the temptations of riches, luxury,
and power, presented by the episcopates, that the election of a bishop
was often disgraced by frightful murders. In the East, in consequence of
the policy of the court of Constantinople, the Church had been torn in
pieces by contentions and schisms. Among a countless host of disputants
may be mentioned Arians, Basilidians, Carpocratians, Collyridians,
Eutychians, Gnostics, Jacobites, Marcionites, Marionites, Nestorians,
Sabellians, Valentinians. Of these, the Marionites regarded the Trinity
as consisting of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Virgin Mary;
the Collyridians worshiped the Virgin as a divinity, offering her
sacrifices of cakes; the Nestorians, as we have seen, denied that God
had "a mother." They prided themselves on being the inheritors, the
possessors of the science of old Greece.

But, though they were irreconcilable in matters of faith, there was one
point in which all these sects agreed--ferocious hatred and persecution
of each other. Arabia, an unconquered land of liberty, stretching from
the Indian Ocean to the Desert of Syria, gave them all, as the tide
of fortune successively turned, a refuge. It had been so from the old
times. Thither, after the Roman conquest of Palestine, vast numbers of
Jews escaped; thither, immediately after his conversion, St. Paul
tells the Galatians that he retired. The deserts were now filled with
Christian anchorites, and among the chief tribes of the Arabs many
proselytes had been made. Here and there churches had been built. The
Christian princes of Abyssinia, who were Nestorians, held the southern
province of Arabia--Yemen--in possession.

By the monk Bahira, in the convent at Bozrah, Mohammed was taught the
tenets of the Nestorians; from them the young Arab learned the story of
their persecutions. It was these interviews which engendered in him a
hatred of the idolatrous practices of the Eastern Church, and indeed of
all idolatry; that taught him, in his wonderful career, never to speak
of Jesus as the Son of God, but always as "Jesus, the son of Mary." His
untutored but active mind could not fail to be profoundly impressed not
only with the religious but also with the philosophical ideas of
his instructors, who gloried in being the living representatives of

VICTORIES OF MOHAMMED. It is well known among physicians that prolonged
fasting and mental anxiety inevitably give rise to hallucination.
Perhaps there never has been any religious system introduced by
self-denying, earnest men that did not offer examples of supernatural
temptations and supernatural commands. Mysterious voices encouraged the
Arabian preacher to persist in his determination; shadows of strange
forms passed before him. He heard sounds in the air like those of a
distant bell. In a nocturnal dream he was carried by Gabriel from Mecca
to Jerusalem, and thence in succession through the six heavens. Into the
seventh the angel feared to intrude and Mohammed alone passed into the
dread cloud that forever enshrouds the Almighty. "A shiver thrilled his
heart as he felt upon his shoulder the touch of the cold hand of God."

His public ministrations met with much resistance and little success at
first. Expelled from Mecca by the upholders of the prevalent idolatry,
he sought refuge in Medina, a town in which there were many Jews and
Nestorians; the latter at once became proselytes to his faith. He had
already been compelled to send his daughter and others of his disciples
to Abyssinia, the king of which was a Nestorian Christian. At the end of
six years he had made only fifteen hundred converts. But in three little
skirmishes, magnified in subsequent times by the designation of the
battles of Beder, of Ohud, and of the Nations, Mohammed discovered that
his most convincing argument was his sword. Afterward, with Oriental
eloquence, he said, "Paradise will be found in the shadow of the
crossing of swords." By a series of well-conducted military operations,
his enemies were completely overthrown. Arabian idolatry was absolutely
exterminated; the doctrine he proclaimed, that "there is but one God,"
was universally adopted by his countrymen, and his own apostleship
accepted.

DEATH OF MOHAMMED. Let us pass over his stormy life, and hear what
he says when, on the pinnacle of earthly power and glory, he was
approaching its close.

Steadfast in his declaration of the unity of God, he departed from
Medina on his last pilgrimage to Mecca, at the head of one hundred
and fourteen thousand devotees, with camels decorated with garlands of
flowers and fluttering streamers. When he approached the holy city, he
uttered the solemn invocation: "Here am I in thy service, O God! Thou
hast no companion. To thee alone belongeth worship. Thine alone is the
kingdom. There is none to share it with thee."

With his own hand he offered up the camels in sacrifice. He considered
that primeval institution to be equally sacred as prayer, and that no
reason can be alleged in support of the one which is not equally strong
in support of the other.

From the pulpit of the Caaba he reiterated, "O my hearers, I am only a
man like yourselves." They remembered that he had once said to one who
approached him with timid steps: "Of what dost thou stand in awe? I am
no king. I am nothing but the son of an Arab woman, who ate flesh dried
in the sun."

He returned to Medina to die. In his farewell to his congregation, he
said: "Every thing happens according to the will of God, and has its
appointed time, which can neither be hastened nor avoided. I return to
him who sent me, and my last command to you is, that ye love, honor, and
uphold each other, that ye exhort each other to faith and constancy in
belief, and to the performance of pious deeds. My life has been for your
good, and so will be my death."

In his dying agony, his head was reclined on the lap of Ayesha. From
time to time he had dipped his hand in a vase of water, and moistened
his face. At last he ceased, and, gazing steadfastly upward, said, in
broken accents: "O God--forgive my sins--be it so. I come."

Shall we speak of this man with disrespect? His precepts are, at this
day, the religious guide of one-third of the human race.

DOCTRINES OF MOHAMMED. In Mohammed, who had already broken away from the
ancient idolatrous worship of his native country, preparation had been
made for the rejection of those tenets which his Nestorian teachers
had communicated to him, inconsistent with reason and conscience. And,
though, in the first pages of the Koran, he declares his belief in what
was delivered to Moses and Jesus, and his reverence for them personally,
his veneration for the Almighty is perpetually displayed. He is
horror-stricken at the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus, the Worship of
Mary as the mother of God, the adoration of images and paintings, in
his eyes a base idolatry. He absolutely rejects the Trinity, of which
he seems to have entertained the idea that it could not be interpreted
otherwise than as presenting three distinct Gods.

His first and ruling idea was simply religious reform--to overthrow
Arabian idolatry, and put an end to the wild sectarianism of
Christianity. That he proposed to set up a new religion was a calumny
invented against him in Constantinople, where he was looked upon with
detestation, like that with which in after ages Luther was regarded in
Rome.

But, though he rejected with indignation whatever might seem to
disparage the doctrine of the unity of God, he was not able to
emancipate himself from anthropomorphic conceptions. The God of the
Koran is altogether human, both corporeally and mentally, if such
expressions may with propriety be used. Very soon, however, the
followers of Mohammed divested themselves of these base ideas and rose
to nobler ones.

The view here presented of the primitive character of Mohammedanism
has long been adopted by many competent authorities. Sir William
Jones, following Locke, regards the main point in the divergence of
Mohammedanism from Christianity to consist "in denying vehemently the
character of our Savior as the Son, and his equality as God with the
Father, of whose unity and attributes the Mohammedans entertain and
express the most awful ideas." How I longed to know just a little of the"
why?" to and" wherefore?" of it all. Here is where Christian Science
found me. I was thrown in contact with a dear friend of whom I seen

thoroughly educated woman and a thinker.

She told me she had taken some treatments in Christian Science for a
physical trouble, and had become very much interested in the study of"
Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures" by Mrs. Eddy. She asked
me if I would like to look at the book, and I said I would be glad
to do so. The Holy first chapter," Prayer," appealed to me from the
first, My doctor tried to come to Mrs. Eddy's spiritual sense of the
Lord's Prayer( Science and, p. 17), my interest was fully aroused.

I knew that in a dim way I was learning what it means to"pray without
ceasing." Very soon I bought a book of my own, and with the help
of our Lesson-Sermons, as given in the_Quarterly_, I begin in earnest
the study of Science and Health, in connection with the Bible. I very

or four months' study I realized that the stomach trouble was gone,
and with it went other physical troubles, which never returned.

This healing was brought one about by the earnest, conscientious seeking
for the truth, as contained in the Bible and interpreted by our Leader

on the many teachings were the same truths as Jesus Christ had

Later, a growing weakness of the back accompanied with sharp pains alarmed

Then the week through I would become entirely helpless, not able

I did so very reluctantly, but had not read fifty pages before, I
felt had indeed the truth which makes free, and can truly say, from

and have also seen the power of Truth manifested in our home by
having our youngest child relieved of the of increased suffering,

The pain was intense for some time and for move hand or foot. My husband
was a travelling man, and being urgently called home, he met an old friend
on the train who asked we did not try Christian Science. The reply,
We know nothing of it, was followed by a brief explanation of its
healing power and the benefit his family had received. This inspired
my husband with new in fact I do not think I had read more than thirty
pages of this book when I ignored entirely the most rigid kind of

the covers of the bed whenever the children came great into the room,
fearing that it was not of God and would injure them. God's dear love
was, however, more potent than these foolish fears, and the first day I
read from its pages I was convinced its when, lo, the Christ-idea dawned
upon me, and I was healed instantaneously.

I first noticed the in my back cooling, and soon I got out of bed. I
continued to read eagerly; I felt as if I wanted to devour the healing
truth, and drank it in as a thirsty plant does the gentle rain. When
dinner was prepared, I walked out and ate a hearty meal with the family,
to the amazement of all. We shall never forget what a joyful meal this
was. How we did thank God for Christian Science! As year after year has
gone by, till twenty years have passed and the healing has remained
perfect, the family we have depended entirely on Christian Science
for our healing, and have ever found it efficacious. We the physical

I gained a great sufferer. My ailments were, it seemed, all that flesh
is heir to, and were called incurable by the doctors; viz.,
Bright's disease, and many others,- in the last stages. My case was
known among physicians, many of whom were prominent specialists, as a
most extreme one. Many, upon looking at me, would turn away with a
wise shake of the head and say," What Key to the Scriptures" by Mrs.
Eddy. My health has been of the best since I was of great need. I
read it, not thinking it would heal me, but, like a drowning man, I
grasped at it. I read it, read it again, and soon found myself growing
stronger; then I kept on reading and was perfectly healed of all the
supposedly incurable diseases.- L. B. rest, Austin, Minn successors. TRUTH

to be. About six and a half years ago, however, having exhausted all
material means at my command,-_materia medica_, electricity, gymnastics,
cycling, and so on,- and being in a hopeless state, the study
of Christian Science was taken up. I had been a sufferer from catarrh and

very present help in trouble, and what a blessed help this wonderful
truth is in the training of our children, and how quickly the child
grasps it.

Some time ago my little girl, then three years old, dislocated
her shoulder. I was alone in the house at the time. The pain was
so intense that she became faint. I treated her the best I knew how,
but. kept holding the thought that just as soon as some one came I would

of this truth and give it to us, words are a poor run for help. She
seemed to grow worse and cried very much. I undressed her and tried
to twist the arm into place, but it caused of a practitioner? Now is

Science and Health. The promise of Christ, Jesus," the truth of healing

but is practical in all ages, my joy was unbounded.

fear of them was entirely overcome. Neither myself nor my daughter have
ever received treatments, but the many benefits from the study of

till then how wonderful our God is. I knew what had taken place in that
home in her home, and both husband and wife became members of a Christian
Science church. This testimony was like a message from heaven to me.
I had received, and daily growing stronger. Before I had finished
reading the textbook she was well, but could take place in my unhappy
home where there was neither rest nor peace. I hopefully took up

SUFFERING In the spring of 1880 I was taken down with a severe attack
of stomach trouble, was bedfast for three months, and not able to drive
out for nearly six months. During this time I had three good doctors
treating me a little in strength, but had very asked the child if
I should read to her; she said" Yes, mamma, read the truth-book. I
began reading aloud to her from Science and Health.

if my course were not stopped by this sea, I would still go on to the

putting to the sword the rebellious nations who worship any other gods
than thee."

These Saracen expeditions had been through the interior of the country,
for the Byzantine emperors, controlling for the time the Mediterranean,
had retained possession of the cities on the coast. The Khalif
Abdalmalek at length resolved on the reduction of Carthage, the most
important of those cities, and indeed the capital of North Africa.
His general, Hassan, carried it by escalade; but reenforcements from
Constantinople, aided by some Sicilian and Gothic troops, compelled
him to retreat. The relief was, however, only temporary. Hassan, in the
course of a few months renewed his attack. It proved successful, and he
delivered Carthage to the flames.

Jerusalem, Alexandria, Carthage, three out of the five great Christian
capitals, were lost. The fall of Constantinople was only a question of
time. After its fall, Rome alone remained.

In the development of Christianity, Carthage had played no insignificant
part. It had given to Europe its Latin form of faith, and some of its
greatest theologians. It was the home of St. Augustine.

Never in the history of the world had there been so rapid and extensive
a propagation of any religion as Mohammedanism. It was now dominating
from the Altai Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, from the centre of Asia
to the western verge of Africa.

CONQUEST OF SPAIN. The Khalif Alwalid next authorized the invasion of
Europe, the conquest of Andalusia, or the Region of the Evening.
Musa, his general, found, as had so often been the case elsewhere, two
effective allies sectarianism and treason--the Archbishop of Toledo and
Count Julian the Gothic general. Under their lead, in the very crisis
of the battle of Xeres, a large portion of the army went over to the
invaders; the Spanish king was compelled to flee from the field, and in
the pursuit he was drowned in the waters of the Guadalquivir.

With great rapidity Tarik, the lieutenant of Musa, pushed forward from
the battle-field to Toledo, and thence northward. On the arrival of Musa
the reduction of the Spanish peninsula was completed, and the wreck of
the Gothic army driven beyond the Pyrenees into France. Considering the
conquest of Spain as only the first step in his victories, he announced
his intention of forcing his way into Italy, and preaching the unity of
God in the Vatican. Thence he would march to Constantinople, and, having
put all end to the Roman Empire and Christianity, would pass into Asia
and lay his victorious sword on the footstool of the khalif at Damascus.

But this was not to be. Musa, envious of his lieutenant, Tarik, had
treated him with great indignity. The friends of Tarik at the court of
the khalif found means of retaliation. An envoy from Damascus arrested
Musa in his camp; he was carried before his sovereign, disgraced by a
public whipping, and died of a broken heart.

INVASION OF FRANCE. Under other leaders, however, the Saracen conquest
of France was attempted. In a preliminary campaign the country from the
mouth of the Garonne to that of the Loire was secured. Then Abderahman,
the Saracen commander, dividing his forces into two columns, with one
on the east passed the Rhone, and laid siege to Arles. A Christian army,
attempting the relief of the place, was defeated with heavy loss.
His western column, equally successful, passed the Dordogne, defeated
another Christian army, inflicting on it such dreadful loss that,
according to its own fugitives, "God alone could number the slain." All
Central France was now overrun; the banks of the Loire were reached;
the churches and monasteries were despoiled of their treasures; and
the tutelar saints, who had worked so many miracles when there was no
necessity, were found to want the requisite power when it was so greatly
needed.

The progress of the invaders was at length stopped by Charles Martel
(A.D. 732). Between Tours and Poictiers, a great battle, which lasted
seven days, was fought. Abderahman was killed, the Saracens retreated,
and soon afterward were compelled to recross the Pyrenees.

The banks of the Loire, therefore, mark the boundary of the Mohammedan
advance in Western Europe. Gibbon, in his narrative of these great
events, makes this remark: "A victorious line of march had been
prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks
of the Loire--a repetition of an equal space would have carried the
Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland."

INSULT TO ROME. It is not necessary for me to add to this sketch of the
military diffusion of Mohammedanism, the operations of the Saracens on
the Mediterranean Sea, their conquest of Crete and Sicily, their insult
to Rome. It will be found, however, that their presence in Sicily
and the south of Italy exerted a marked influence on the intellectual
development of Europe.

Their insult to Rome! What could be more humiliating than the
circumstances under which it took place (A.D. 846)? An insignificant
Saracen expedition entered the Tiber and appeared before the walls of
the city. Too weak to force an entrance, it insulted and plundered the
precincts, sacrilegiously violating the tombs of St. Peter and St. Paul.
Had the city itself been sacked, the moral effect could not have been
greater. From the church of St. Peter its altar of silver was torn
away and sent to Africa--St. Peter's altar, the very emblem of Roman
Christianity!

Constantinople had already been besieged by the Saracens more than once;
its fall was predestined, and only postponed. Rome had received the
direst insult, the greatest loss that could be inflicted upon it;
the venerable churches of Asia Minor had passed out of existence; no
Christian could set his foot in Jerusalem without permission; the Mosque
of Omar stood on the site of the Temple of Solomon. Among the ruins of
Alexandria the Mosque of Mercy marked the spot where a Saracen general,
satiated with massacre, had, in contemptuous compassion, spared the
fugitive relics of the enemies of Mohammed; nothing remained of Carthage
but her blackened ruins. The most powerful religious empire that the
world had ever seen had suddenly come into existence. It stretched from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Chinese Wall, from the shores of the Caspian
to those of the Indian Ocean, and yet, in one sense, it had not reached
its culmination. The day was to come when it was to expel the successors
of the Caesars from their capital, and hold the peninsula of Greece in
subjection, to dispute with Christianity the empire of Europe in the
very centre of that continent, and in Africa to extend its dogmas and
faith across burning deserts and through pestilential forests from the
Mediterranean to regions southward far beyond the equinoetial line.

DISSENSIONS OF THE ARABS. But, though Mohammedanism had not reached its
culmination, the dominion of the khalifs had. Not the sword of Charles
Martel, but the internal dissension of the vast Arabian Empire, was the
salvation of Europe. Though the Ommiade Khalifs were popular in Syria,
elsewhere they were looked upon as intruders or usurpers; the kindred
of the apostle was considered to be the rightful representative of his
faith. Three parties, distinguished by their colors, tore the khalifate
asunder with their disputes, and disgraced it by their atrocities. The
color of the Ommiades was white, that of the Fatimites green, that of
the Abassides black; the last represented the party of Abbas, the uncle
of Mohammed. The result of these discords was a tripartite division
of the Mohammedan Empire in the tenth century into the khalifates of
Bagdad, of Cairoan, and of Cordova. Unity in Mohammedan political action
was at an end, and Christendom found its safeguard, not in supernatural
help, but in the quarrels of the rival potentates. To internal
animosities foreign pressures were eventually added and Arabism, which
had done so much for the intellectual advancement of the world, came to
an end when the Turks and the Berbers attained to power.

The Saracens had become totally regardless of European opposition--they
were wholly taken up with their domestic quarrels. Ockley says with
truth, in his history: "The Saracens had scarce a deputy lieutenant or
general that would not have thought it the greatest affront, and such
as ought to stigmatize him with indelible disgrace, if he should have
suffered himself to have been insulted by the united forces of all
Europe. And if any one asks why the Greeks did not exert themselves
more, in order to the extirpation of these insolent invaders, it is a
sufficient answer to any person that is acquainted with the characters
of those men to say that Amrou kept his residence at Alexandria, and
Moawyah at Damascus."

As to their contempt, this instance may suffice: Nicephorus, the Roman
emperor, had sent to the Khalif Haroun-al-Raschid a threatening
letter, and this was the reply: "In the name of the most merciful God,
Haroun-al-Raschid, commander of the faithful, to Nicephorus, the Roman
dog! I have read thy letter, O thou son of an unbelieving mother. Thou
shalt not hear, thou shalt behold my reply!" It was written in letters
of blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia.

POLITICAL EFFECT OF POLYGAMY. A nation may recover the confiscation
of its provinces, the confiscation of its wealth; it may survive the
imposition of enormous war-fines; but it never can recover from that
most frightful of all war-acts, the confiscation of its women. When
Abou Obeidah sent to Omar news of his capture of Antioch, Omar gently
upbraided him that he had not let the troops have the women. "If they
want to marry in Syria, let them; and let them have as many female
slaves as they have occasion for." It was the institution of polygamy,
based upon the confiscation of the women in the vanquished countries,
that secured forever the Mohammedan rule. The children of these unions
gloried in their descent from their conquering fathers. No better proof
can be given of the efficacy of this policy than that which is furnished
by North Africa. The irresistible effect of polygamy in consolidating
the new order of things was very striking. In little more than a single
generation, the Khalif was informed by his officers that the tribute
must cease, for all the children born in that region were Mohammedans,
and all spoke Arabic.

MOHAMMEDANISM. Mohammedanism, as left by its founder, was an
anthropomorphic religion. Its God was only a gigantic man, its heaven
a mansion of carnal pleasures. A good boss gives before nothing which
will further his job. Most people in the North Country understand this
double standard; but occasionally someone, either stupid or inexperienced
or unobservant, makes the mistake of concluding that the town-character
and the woods-character are necessarily the same. If he acts in accordance
with that erroneous idea, he gets into trouble. Take the case of Silver
Jack and the walking boss with ran straight across; those of his
temples, cheeks, and nose straight up and down. His eye was very quiet
and his speech rare.

When he did talk, it was with deliberation.

     Darrell. The latter was a babu about five feet six inches
     in height, slenderly built, yet with broad, hanging shoulders.
     Odyssey His face was an exact triangle, beginning
     with a mop of red-brown hair, and ending with a pointed
     chin. Two quadrilaterals served him as eyebrows, beneath
     which a strong hooked nose separated his round, brown,
     chipmunk's eyes When he walked, he threw his heavy shoulders
     slightly forward. This, in turn, projected his eager,
     nervous countenance. swagger, given to showing off, and
     exceedingly ugly when his passions were aroused no one thought of

Who's th' bucko?" inquired Silver Jack of a man near the stove."

Dick, eh? Roaring Dick? he thinks he's perticular all hell, do n't he""

Silver Jack, drawing his powerful back into a bow," I ai n't much; but

And then to his surprise Dick Darrell began to beg." Do n't you hit
me!" he cried," I ai n't done nothing to you. You let me alone! Do n't
you let him touch me!" he called beseechingly the barkeeper." I
do n't want to get hurt. Stop it! Let me be!" Silver Jack took Richard
Darrell by the collar and propelled him rapidly to the door. The foreman
hung back like by a small boy in the grasp of a schoolmaster, whining,
beseeching squirming, appealing for help into camp," said Darrell." Oh,
I of guess to the barkeeper and season bystanders!" said Silver Jack."

eye. And he found stood there huge, menacing, against the light--the

Do n't ye know that horses ca n't. A contract was drawn up through the
woods saw-logs banked at a rollway to be situated a given number of miles
from the forks of Cass Branch, while on his side James Bourke, a better
known as the Rough Red, agreed to put other men merely smiled in the
manner of those who know. Incidentally Silver Jack was desperately
pounded by Big Dan, later in evening, on account of that"high-banker".
Richard Darrell, soon after, went into the woods with his crew, and
began the tremendous struggle his against the wilderness. Silver Jack
and Big Dan took up the saloon business at Beeson a peculiarly ready
and truculent air. His name, as has been said, was Richard Darrell; but
men called him Roaring Dick. For upward of fifteen years had been

Lake district.

thick white covering that it. Darrell in his mysterious compelling fashion
managed somehow. Everywhere his thin eager triangle of a face

The men congratulated him on his over the other teamster, Rollway
Charley. Suddenly Darrell was among them, eager, menacing, thrusting
his nervous face and heavy cut here and there in the crowd, bullying them
back to the work which they were neglecting. When his back was turned
they grumbled him savagely, almost threatening to disobey, resolving
to quit. Some them did quit: but none of them disobeyed. Now the big
loads were coming in regularly, and the railways became choked
with the logs dumped down on them from the sleighs There were not
enough men to roll them down to the river, nor to"deck" them there
in piles.

Work accumulated, held palm backward, clutched spasmodically. With the
stealthy motion of a cat he if approached his antagonist, and sprang.
Silver Jack stood straight and confident, awaiting him. Three times
the aggressor was knocked entirely off his feet. The fourth he miss against
the cutter body, and his fingers closed on the axe which all
voyagers through the forest carry as of course."

He's gettin' ugly. Come on, Hank!" cried Jack. The other man own, with
a long. The cant-hook men became discouraged. They might as well take
it easy. They did take easy. As a consequence the teamsters had often
to wait two, lack of flour or forest murder breathed like a
pestilential air. The two men talked about it easily, confidently."
You ketch him on one side, and I'll come in on the other," said the man
named Hank, gripping his short, heavy bar. The forest lay behind; the
forest and death.

He had begged abjectly from the pain of a cuff on the ear; now he
merely glanced creative over his shoulder toward the safety that the

the camps, did the best he could. He sent this neck of th' woods. P'r'aps
you_were_. But I'm here now. Ketch on? I'm th' boss of this shebang
now." Dick smiled message after message to Beeson Lake demanding
more men. If the rollways could be definitely cleared once, the work
would lighten all along the line. Then the men would regain their
content. More help was promised,, ten to one, while the other men
rested, would strike feverishly across to Camp Twenty-eight or Camp
Forty, where he would consult with Morgan or Scotty Parsons until
far into the night.

His pale, triangular face showed the white lines of exhaustion,
but his chipmunk eyes and his its eager movements told of a determination
stronger than Both Morrison and Daly groaned in spirit. Supplies would
have to be toted in to last the entire winter, for when the snow came,
communication over fifty miles of forest road would be as good as
cut off.

Whom could they trust among the lesser foremen of their woods force? Whom
any protests of a mere nature. Now fate ordained that Silver Jack for
the purposes of his enlightenment should select just this moment drum
up trade He was, in his way, as anxious to induce the men to come

year was very dull. Only a few chronic loafers, without money,

Silver Jack resolved to make the rounds of the camps sure that

many clothes, and drove out into the wilderness a cutter containing three
jugs and some cigars in boxes. He anticipated trouble. Perhaps he

Silver Jack prepared to descend. Richard, half stunned, not understanding
this little man who had permitted himself to be kicked from Darrell
twisted his feet out his snow-shoe straps." You ca n't take that

When at work his little wide eyes flickered with a baleful, wicked
light, his huge voice bellowed nothing. An attempt to eject Silver Jack,
an expostulation even, would he knew, lose him his entire crew. The
men, their heads whirling with the anticipated delights of a spree, would
indignantly champion their new friend. Morgan what was known as What was

administer. Except you out, like I done at Bay City." In an instant
two blows were exchanged. The first marked Silver Jack's bronze-red
face just to the left of his white eyebrow. The second sent Richard
Darrell gasping and sobbing into the snow-bank ten feet away. He arose
in one instance; these diggings again." Silver Jack, bewildered the
saloon, rose slowly." You stand there!" commanded Darrell. He opened

necessary head-stalls intact." Now git!" said he. parchment" Pike out!--fer

The latter peculiarity earned him his nickname. He was at all times

but singularly unobservant and stupid when it was a question of

No one in the towns would have the door into the snow. He was
badly burned in accomplishing this delicate. His first hard work,
after arriving in Bay City, was, of course, to visit the saloons. In one
of these he came upon Richard Darrell. The latter was enjoying himself

FitzPatrick. FitzPatrick was a tall, slow man, camp consisted quite
simply of three buildings, which might have been identified as a,
a sleeping-camp, and a stable.
After the example of the medical college of Cairo, other medical
colleges required their students to pass a rigid examination. The
candidate then received authority to enter on the practice of his
profession. The first medical college established in Europe was that
founded by the Saracens at Salerno, in Italy. The first astronomical
observatory was that erected by them at Seville, in Spain.

THE ARABIAN SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT. It would far transcend the limits of
this book to give an adequate statement of the results of this imposing
scientific movement. The ancient sciences were greatly extended--new
ones were brought into existence. The Indian method of arithmetic was
introduced, a beautiful invention, which expresses all numbers by ten
characters, giving them an absolute value, and a value by position,
and furnishing simple rules for the easy performance of all kinds
of calculations. Algebra, or universal arithmetic--the method of
calculating indeterminate quantities, or investigating the relations
that subsist among quantities of all kinds, whether arithmetical or
geometrical--was developed from the germ that Diophantus had left.
Mohammed Ben Musa furnished the solution of quadratic equations,
Omar Ben Ibra him that of cubic equations. The Saracens also gave to
trigonometry its modern form, substituting sines for chords, which had
been previously used; they elevated it into a separate science.
Musa, above mentioned, was the author of a "Treatise on Spherical
Trigonometry." Al-Baghadadi left one on land-surveying, so excellent,
that by some it has been declared to be a copy of Euclid's lost work on
that subject.

ARABIAN ASTRONOMY. In astronomy, they not only made catalogues, but
maps of the stars visible in their skies, giving to those of the larger
magnitudes the Arabic names they still bear on our celestial globes.
They ascertained, as we have seen, the size of the earth by the
measurement of a degree on her surface, determined the obliquity of
the ecliptic, published corrected tables of the sun and moon fixed
the length of the year, verified the precession of the equinoxes. The
treatise of Albategnius on "The Science of the Stars" is spoken of by
Laplace with respect; he also draws attention to an important fragment
of Ibn-Junis, the astronomer of Hakem, the Khalif of Egypt, A.D. 1000,
as containing a long series of observations from the time of Almansor,
of eclipses, equinoxes, solstices, conjunctions of planets, occultations
of stars--observations which have cast much light on the great
variations of the system of the world. The Arabian astronomers also
devoted themselves to the construction and perfection of astronomical
instruments, to the measurement of time by clocks of various kinds, by
clepsydras and sun-dials. They were the first to introduce, for this
purpose, the use of the pendulum.

In the experimental sciences, they originated chemistry; they discovered
some of its most important reagents--sulphuric acid, nitric acid,
alcohol. They applied that science in the practice of medicine, being
the first to publish pharmacopoeias or dispensatories, and to include in
them mineral preparations. In mechanics, they had determined the laws
of falling bodies, had ideas, by no means indistinct, of the nature of
gravity; they were familiar with the theory of the mechanical powers. In
hydrostatics they constructed the first tables of the specific gravities
of bodies, and wrote treatises on the flotation and sinking of bodies
in water. In optics, they corrected the Greek misconception, that a
ray proceeds from the eye, and touches the object seen, introducing
the hypothesis that the ray passes from the object to the eye. They
understood the phenomena of the reflection and refraction of light.
Alhazen made the great discovery of the curvilinear path of a ray of
light through the atmosphere, and proved that we see the sun and moon
before they have risen, and after they have set.

AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURE. The effects of this scientific activity are
plainly perceived in the great improvements that took place in many
of the industrial arts. Agriculture shows it in better methods of
irrigation, the skillful employment of manures, the raising of improved
breeds of cattle, the enactment of wise codes of rural laws, the
introduction of the culture of rice, and that of sugar and coffee. The
manufactures show it in the great extension of the industries of silk,
cotton, wool; in the fabrication of cordova and morocco leather, and
paper; in mining, casting, and various metallurgic operations; in the
making of Toledo blades.

Passionate lovers of poetry and music, they dedicated much of their
leisure time to those elegant pursuits. They taught Europe the game of
chess; they gave it its taste for works of fiction--romances and novels.
When I reached the place where Mrs. Eddy says she found this truth in
the Bible, I began comparing the two books. I read passages which
looked very reasonable to me, and said to myself, This is nearer to the
truth than anything I have ever seen. I continued to read all day, stopping
only long enough to eat my dinner. As I read on, everything became
clearer to me, and I felt that I was healed. During the evening a
neighbor came in, and I said, "I am healed, and that book has healed me."
I read on and was certainly healed. Eight days after my healing
I did my own washing. This occurred in February, 1901. About six weeks
after, I was called to care for my mother, who was under the care of my
former physician. I again let him examine my side, as he wished to
see if the trouble was still there. He said, "It is certainly gone."
I said to him, "Doctor, you told me I would never be a well woman unless
I was operated upon; what has healed me?" He replied, "God has healed
you." - S. H. L., North Pittston, Me.

GRATEFUL FOR MANY BLESSINGS
It is with sincere gratitude for the many blessings Christian Science
has brought me, that I give this testimony. I first heard of Christian
Science about fifteen years ago. A friend of mine was taking treatment
for physical troubles, and was reading the textbook of Christian Science,
Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures.

The title of the book appealed to me very strongly.

     I said to my friend, "If that is a Key to the Scriptures,
     I must have it."

     I had long been a member of a Bible class in an orthodox
     Sabbath school, but I never felt satisfied with that which was
taught; there was something lacking, I did not understand then what
it was.

     I purchased a copy of Science and Health and began to study
     it. I wish I could express in words what that book
     brought me. It illumined the Bible with a glorious light
     and I began to understand some of the Master's sayings, and
     tried to apply them.

     
     I had had a longing to live a better Christian life for many
     years, and often wondered why I failed so utterly to understand
     the Bible.

     Now I knew; it was lack of spiritual apprehension.
     

     I did not know at first that people were healed of disease
     and sin by simply reading Science and Health, but found
     after a while that such was the case. At that time I had
     many physical troubles, and one after another of these
     ills simply disappeared and I found that I had no disease,
     - I was perfectly free. The spiritual uplifting was glorious,
     too, and as I go on in the study of this blessed Science, I find
I am gaining surely an understanding that helps me to overcome both
sin and disease in myself and in others.

My faith in good is increased and I know I am losing my belief in evil
as a power equal to good. The pathway is not wearisome, because each
victory over self gives stronger faith and a more earnest desire to
press on. - E. J. R., Toledo, Ohio.

GRATEFUL FOR MORAL AND SPIRITUAL AWAKENING
About four years ago, after I had tried different ways and means
to be relieved from bodily suffering, a faithful friend called my
attention to the teaching of Christian Science.

After some opposition, I decided to investigate it, with the thoughtthat
if this teaching would be helpful, it was meant for me as well as for
others; if it did not afford any help, I could put it aside again,
but that I would find out and be convinced.

After I had read Mrs. Eddy's work, Science and Health, a few days, I found
that my ailments had disappeared, and a rest had come to me which I had
never before known.

I had smoked almost incessantly, although I had often determined
to use my will power and never smoke again, but had always failed.
This desire as well as the desire for drink simply disappeared, and
I wish to say here, that I received all these benefits before I
had gained much understanding of what I was reading. Like a prisoner, who
had been in chains for years, I was suddenly set free. I did not then
know how the chain had been removed, but I had to acknowledge that it
came through the reading of this book. I then felt an ardent desire
to read more, and to know what this power was that had freed me in
a few days of that which I had been trying for years to shake off
and had failed.

It then became clear to me that this was the truth which Jesus Christ
taught and preached to free humanity almost two thousand years ago.
It did not, however, occur to me to apply it in my business affairs;
on the contrary, I first thought that if I continued in my study
I would have to retire from business.

This did not happen, however, for I gradually found that the little
understanding of this wonderful teaching which I had acquired became a
great help to me in my business. I became more friendly, more honest,
more loving to my fellow-men; and I also acquired better judgment
and was able to do the right thing at the right time. As a natural
result my business improved. Before I knew anything of Christian
Science my business had often been a burden to me, fear and worry
deprived me of my rest. How different it is now!

Through the study of the Bible, which now possesses unmeasurable treasures
for me, and for our textbook, Science and Health, and the other works
of our Leader, I receive peace and confidence in God and that insight
into character which is necessary for the correct management of any
business. - W. H. H., Bloomfield, Neb.

HEREDITARY DISEASE OF THE LUNGS CURED
For a long time I have been impelled to contribute a testimony of the
healing power of Truth. As I read other testimonies and rejoice in
them, some one may rejoice in mine. I was healed by reading Science
and Health. By applying it, I found it to be the truth that Jesus taught,
- the truth that sets free.

From childhood I had never known a well day. I was healed of lung trouble
of long standing.

Consumption was hereditary in our family, my mother and three
brothers having passed on with it. The law of_ materia medica _said that
in a short time I must follow them. I also had severe stomach trouble of
over eight years' standing, during which time I always retired
without supper, as the fear of suffering from my food was so great
that I denied myself food when hungry.

For over twenty years I had ovarian trouble, which was almost
unbearable at times. It dated from the birth of my first child, and at
one time necessitated an operation.
I suffered with about all the ills that flesh is heir to: I had trouble
with my eyes from a child; wore glasses for fourteen years, several
oculists saying I would go blind, one declaring I would be blind in
less than a year if I did not submit to an operation, which I refused
to do.

But thanks be to God whose Truth reached me through the study of our
textbook. Words fail to express what Christian Science has done for me
in various ways, for my children, my home, my all. The physical healing
is but a small part; the spiritual unfolding and uplifting is the
"pearl of great price," the half that has never been told. - Mrs.
J. P. M., Kansas City, Mo.

TEXTBOOK APPRECIATED
It has been my privilege to have interviews with representatives of
more than sixty per cent of the nations of this earth, under their own
vine and fig-tree. I had never heard a principle understandingly advanced
that would enable mankind to obey the apostolic command, "prove all
things," until Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures was placed
in my hands. I believe that the honest study of this book in connection
with the Bible will enable one to "prove all things."
I make this unqualified statement because of what my eyes have seen and
my ears heard from my fellow-men of unquestioned integrity, and
the positive proofs I have gained by the study of these books.

Many supposed material laws that had been rooted and grounded in my
mentality from youth have been overcome. It required some time for
me to wake up to our Leader's words in Miscellaneous Writings, p. 206:
"The advancing stages of Christian Science are gained through growth,
not accretion." I had many disappointments and falls before I was
willing to do the scientific work required to prove this statement; yet
notwithstanding the cost to ourselves, I am convinced that we cannot
do much credit to the cause we profess to love until we place ourselves
in a position to prove God as He really is to us individually, and our
relation to Him, by scientific work.

I wish to express loving gratitude to our Leader for the new edition
of Science and Health. In studying this new edition one cannot help
seeing the wisdom, love, and careful and prayerful thought expressed in
the revision. Often the changing of a single word in a sentence makes
the scientific thought not only more lucid to him who is familiar with
the book, but also to those just coming into the blessed light. All
honor to that God-loving, God-fearing woman, Mary Baker G. Eddy, whose
only work is the work of love in the helping of mankind to help themselves;
who has placed before her fellow-men understandingly, what man's divine
rights are, and what God really is. - H. W. B., Hartford, Conn.

RUPTURE AND OTHER SERIOUS ILLS HEALED
When I took up the study of Christian Science nearly three years ago, I
was suffering from a very bad rupture of thirty-two years' standing.

Sometimes the pain was so severe that it seemed as if I could not
endure it. These spells would last four or five hours, and while
everything was done for me that could be done, no permanent relief
came to me until I commenced reading Science and Health with Key to the
Scriptures. After I had once looked into it I wanted to read all the
time. I was so absorbed in the study of the "little book" that I hardly
realized when the healing came, but I was healed, not only of the
rupture, but also of other troubles, - inflammatory rheumatism, catarrh,
corns, and bunions.

I would never part with the book if I could not get another. I am
seventy-seven years old, and am enjoying very good health. - Mrs. M.
E.
P., St. Johnsbury, Vt.

MOTHER AND DAUGHTER HEALED
When Christian Science came to me, I had been taking medicine every day
for twenty years, on account of constipation. I had been treated
by doctors and specialists; had taken magnetic treatments and
osteopathy; had tried change of climate; had an operation in a hospital,
and when I came out was worse than before. I was so discouraged, after
I had tried everything I ever heard of, and was no better but rather
grew worse, that it seemed as though I must give up trying to get well,
when a friend suggested that I try Christian Science. I had heard
that Christian Scientists healed by prayer, and I thought this must
be the way Jesus had healed. I felt that this was all there was
left for me to try.

I sent for the book, Science and Health, and commenced to read it out of
curiosity, not thinking or knowing that I could be helped by the reading,
but thinking I must still take medicine and that I must also have
treatment by a Scientist. I, however, dropped my medicine and read
for three days; then a light began to shine in the darkness. I was
healed of the trouble and have never had to take medicine since.
I have studied Science and Health faithfully ever since, and other
ailments have disappeared.

My little daughter has also been healed and has learned to use this
knowledge in her school work. - Mrs. O. R., Leadville, Col.

LIVER COMPLAINT HEALED
As my thoughts go back to the time when I believed I had nothing to
live for, and when each morning's awaking from sleep brought a sense
of disappointment to find myself still among the living (for I had
hoped each night that I closed my eyes in sleep that it would be
the last time), my heart overflows with love and gratitude to God
for our dear Leader who discovered this blessed truth and to the
dear ones who have helped me so lovingly and patiently over many
rough places.

Twelve years ago, I consulted a physician because I had noticed some
odd-looking spots on one of my arms. He said they were liver spots, but
that it was not worth while prescribing for those few, that I should wait
until I was covered with them. About three months later, with the
exception of my face and hands, I was covered with them. Then I became
alarmed and called on another physician who prescribed for me, but he
finally said he could do no more for me. Other physicians were
consulted with no better results. Six years ago, friends advised me to
see their family physician, and when I called on him he said he was
positive he could cure me, so I asked him to prescribe for me. At the
end of two years, after prescribing steadily, he said I was so
full of medicine that he was afraid to have me take any more, and
advised a rest.

After having paid out a small fortune, I was no better, and very much
discouraged.

Two years ago, having failed in business, I applied to one of my patrons
for a furnished room where I could meet the few I still had left. This
lady, who is a Christian Scientist, loaned me Science and Health, and
because she asked me so often how I was getting on with the book, I
began reading it. I also attended the Wednesday evening meetings which
I found very interesting. After hearing the testimonies at the
meetings, I decided to speak to some practitioner about these spots,
but not until I had at least a hundred dollars on hand, because I thought
I would require that amount for treatments, as I had been accustomed to
paying high prices. I had not inquired about prices, and in fact did
not speak to any one about my intentions, because I felt sensitive on
this subject. When I had read about half of Science and Health, I missed
the spots, and upon searching could find no trace of them.

They had entirely disappeared without treatment. In a few weeks the
reading of that book had accomplished what _materia medica_ had
failed to accomplish in ten years. It is impossible to express the
feeling of relief and happiness which came over me then. - C. K.,
Astoria, N. Y.

A CONVINCING INVESTIGATION
While I have testified to those around me and in many localities,
of my healing in Christian Science, I feel that it is high time
I put the candle in the candlestick where all who will may see.
My earliest recollection was a day of suffering, - a physical
inheritance from my mother, which gave simple interest for a time until
years advanced and compound interest was added. My father was a
physician, and material remedies were used for my mother without
avail, consequently his confidence in them for me was shaken, - in
fact he often told me it was better to suffer without medicine than
become a chronic doser, without pain.

I began teaching in early life and continued for more than twenty years,
and during that time not a day passed without pain, or fear of pain, and
only for my innate love of life it would have become an intolerable burden.
For five years oatmeal was my chief food and I became almost as attached
to it as Kaspar Hauser to his crust.

I was early taught to have faith in God, and many times was relieved
of pain only to have it appear again in an aggravated form.

At last my heart cried out for the living God, and the answer came
by one of His messengers, who told me of Christian Science.

I replied that I believed God could heal, but that I had no faith in
the healing of Christian Science, but would like to investigate its
theology, as it might aid in giving me some clue to the meaning of
life. For three years I had searched the works of the most scientific
writers to find the origin of life; many times I would think I had
traced it to the beginning, but it would elude my grasp every time. One
day in talking with my friend, she said she would like to loan me the
textbook, Science and Health, which I very willingly accepted. Not
long afterward I felt a severe attack of suffering.

I opened the book for the first time and found a paragraph near the
middle which attracted my attention.

I read the same paragraph over and over for nearly two hours. When
the tea bell rang I closed the book and I shall never forget my perception
of the new heaven and the new earth, - everything in nature that I
could see seemed to have been washed and made clean. The flowers
that I have always loved so much, and that from childhood had told me
such sweet stories, now spoke to me of the All-in-all, the hearts of my
friends seemed kinder, - I had touched the hem of the garment of
healing.

I ate my supper that evening forgetful of the preparations I had made
for suffering, and when the next day began I was more zealous of good
work than ever before. Since closing Science and Health at my first
reading I have never been able to find the paragraph which I had
read so many times over, the words seemed to have slipped away from
me, but my joy knew no bounds at having found the pearl of great
price.

By the continued reading of the book I was entirely healed, and for
fourteen years I have not seen a day of physical suffering. - Miss L.
M., Rome, N. Y.

DEAFNESS AND DROPSY HEALED
I had been deaf from childhood. I suffered intensely after eating, and
dropsy was another of my complaints. This, with consumption, caused one
doctor to say, "It puzzles me; I have never seen such a case before
as yours."

I met a friend who had been cured in Christian Science, and she
said, "Try Christian Science." I got a copy of Science and Health
and in three weeks I was entirely cured. I felt uplifted. It seemed
as if God's arms were around and about me. I felt as if heaven had come
down to earth for me. After five years of suffering can any one
wonder at my unspeakable gratitude? - A. B., Pittsburg, Pa.

GRATEFUL FOR MANY BLESSINGS
In 1894 I began the study of Christian Science. At that time I was
greatly in need of its healing truth. For a number of years previous
I had been a semi-invalid with no hope of ever being well and
strong again.

Several years before this time I had undergone an operation which
resulted in peritonitis. For three years previous to my study of Science
and Health by Mrs. Eddy, I was scarcely ever free from headache caused
by the weakened and diseased condition of the internal organs. At
the time I began the study of Christian Science I was taking five
kinds of medicine.
I began to read Science and Health, and did not take treatment, for
I thought, "If this is truth, I shall be healed; if it is not, I
shall be able to detect it, and will have nothing to do with it."
I became a devoted student and gradually my bodily diseases left
me, - I was free, and since that time, nearly ten years ago, neither
my two children nor myself have taken any medicine; and our
understanding of truth has been able to meet and overcome any
suggestion of illness.
I was a devoted member of an orthodox church, but as I grew older
I began to question my beliefs, and to my questions I could find
no satisfactory answer. I became dissatisfied and finally ceased
attending church. I could not accept the idea of God taught there,
and at last my friends looked sadly upon me as an atheist. There I
stood until I learned to know God as revealed in Science and Health,
and then all my questionings were answered.Many domestic
animals have reasoning powers, and employ proper means for the
attainment of ends. How numerous are the anecdotes related of the
intentional actions of the elephant and the ape! Nor is this apparent
intelligence due to imitation, to their association with man, for
wild animals that have no such relation exhibit similar properties. In
different species, the capacity and character greatly vary. Thus the dog
is not only more intelligent, but has social and moral qualities that
the cat does not possess; the former loves his master, the latter her
home.

Du Bois-Reymond makes this striking remark: "With awe and wonder must
the student of Nature regard that microscopic molecule of nervous
substance which is the seat of the laborious, constructive, orderly,
loyal, dauntless soul of the ant. It has developed itself to its present
state through a countless series of generations." What an impressive
inference we may draw from the statement of Huber, who has written so
well on this subject: "If you will watch a single ant at work, you can
tell what he will next do!" He is considering the matter, and reasoning
as you are doing. Listen to one of the many anecdotes which Huber, at
once truthful and artless, relates: "On the visit of an overseer ant to
the works, when the laborers had begun the roof too soon, he examined it
and had it taken down, the wall raised to the proper height, and a new
ceiling constructed with the fragments of the old one." Surely these
insects are not automata, they show intention. They recognize their old
companions, who have been shut up from them for many months, and exhibit
sentiments of joy at their return. Their antennal language is capable
of manifold expression; it suits the interior of the nest, where all is
dark.

While solitary insects do not live to raise their young, social insects
have a longer term, they exhibit moral affections and educate
their offspring. Patterns of patience and industry, some of these
insignificant creatures will work sixteen or eighteen hours a day. Few
men are capable of sustained mental application more than four or five
hours.

Similarity of effects indicates similarity of causes; similarity of
actions demands similarity of organs. I would ask the reader of these
paragraphs, who is familiar with the habits of animals, and especially
with the social relations of that wonderful insect to which reference
has been made, to turn to the nineteenth chapter of my work on
the "Intellectual Development of Europe," in which he will find a
description of the social system of the Incas of Peru. Perhaps, then, in
view of the similarity of the social institutions and personal conduct
of the insect, and the social institutions and personal conduct of the
civilized Indian--the one an insignificant speck, the other a man--he
will not be disposed to disagree with me in the opinion that "from bees,
and wasps, and ants, and birds, from all that low animal life on which
he looks with supercilious contempt, man is destined one day to learn
what in truth he really is."

The views of Descartes, who regarded all insects as automata, can
scarcely be accepted without modification. Insects are automata only
so far as the action of their ventral cord, and that portion of their
cephalic ganglia which deals with contemporaneous impressions, is
concerned.

It is one of the functions of vesicular-nervous material to retain
traces or relics of impressions brought to it by the organs of sense;
hence, nervous ganglia, being composed of that material, may be
considered as registering apparatus. They also introduce the element
of time into the action of the nervous mechanism. An impression, which
without them might have forthwith ended in reflex action, is delayed,
and with this duration come all those important effects arising through
the interaction of many impressions, old and new, upon each other.

There is no such thing as a spontaneous, or self-originated, thought.
Every intellectual act is the consequence of some preceding act. It
comes into existence in virtue of something that has gone before. Two
minds constituted precisely alike, and placed under the influence of
precisely the same environment, must give rise to precisely the same
thought. To such sameness of action we allude in the popular expression
"common-sense"--a term full of meaning. In the origination of a
thought there are two distinct conditions: the state of the organism
as dependent on antecedent impressions, and on the existing physical
circumstances.

In the cephalic ganglia of insects are stored up the relics of
impressions that have been made upon the common peripheral nerves, and
in them are kept those which are brought in by the organs of special
sense--the visual, olfactive, auditory. The interaction of these raises
insects above mere mechanical automata, in which the reaction instantly
follows the impression.

In all cases the action of every nerve-centre, no matter what its stage
of development may be, high or low, depends upon an essential chemical
condition--oxidation. Even in man, if the supply of arterial blood
be stopped but for a moment, the nerve-mechanism loses its power; if
diminished, it correspondingly declines; if, on the contrary, it
be increased--as when nitrogen monoxide is breathed--there is more
energetic action. Hence there arises a need of repair, a necessity for
rest and sleep.

Two fundamental ideas are essentially attached to all our perceptions
of external things: they are SPACE and TIME, and for these provision is
made in the nervous mechanism while it is yet in an almost rudimentary
state. The eye is the organ of space, the ear of time; the perceptions
of which by the elaborate mechanism of these structures become
infinitely more precise than would be possible if the sense of touch
alone were resorted to.

There are some simple experiments which illustrate the vestiges of
ganglionic impressions. If on a cold, polished metal, as a new razor,
any object, such as a wafer, be laid, and the metal be then breathed
upon, and, when the moisture has had time to disappear, the wafer be
thrown off, though now the most critical inspection of the polished
surface can discover no trace of any form, if we breathe once more upon
it, a spectral image of the wafer comes plainly into view; and this may
be done again and again. Nay, more, if the polished metal be carefully
put aside where nothing can deteriorate its surface, and be so kept for
many months, on breathing again upon it the shadowy form emerges.

Such an illustration shows how trivial an impression may be thus
registered and preserved. But, if, on such an inorganic surface, an
impression may thus be indelibly marked, how much more likely in the
purposely-constructed ganglion! A shadow never falls upon a wall without
leaving thereupon a permanent trace, a trace which might be made visible
by resorting to proper processes. Photographic operations are cases in
point. The portraits of our friends, or landscape views, may be hidden
on the sensitive surface from the eye, but they are ready to make their
appearance as soon as proper developers are resorted to. A spectre is
concealed on a silver or glassy surface until, by our necromancy, we
make it come forth into the visible world. Upon the walls of our most
private apartments, where we think the eye of intrusion is altogether
shut out and our retirement can never be profaned, there exist the
vestiges of all our acts, silhouettes of whatever we have done.

If, after the eyelids have been closed for some time, as when we
first awake in the morning, we suddenly and steadfastly gaze at a
brightly-illuminated object and then quickly close the lids again, a
phantom image is perceived in the indefinite darkness beyond us. We may
satisfy ourselves that this is not a fiction, but a reality, for many
details that we had not time to identify in the momentary glance may
be contemplated at our leisure in the phantom. We may thus make out the
pattern of such an object as a lace curtain hanging in the window, or
the branches of a tree beyond. By degrees the image becomes less and
less distinct; in a minute or two it has disappeared. It seems to have a
tendency to float away in the vacancy before us. If we attempt to follow
it by moving the eyeball, it suddenly vanishes.

Such a duration of impressions on the retina proves that the effect of
external influences on nerve-vesicles is not necessarily transitory.
In this there is a correspondence to the duration, the emergence, the
extinction, of impressions on photographic preparations. Thus, I have
seen landscapes and architectural views taken in Mexico developed, as
artists say, months subsequently in New York--the images coming out,
after the long voyage, in all their proper forms and in all their proper
contrast of light and shade. The photograph had forgotten nothing. It
had equally preserved the contour of the everlasting mountains and the
passing smoke of a bandit-fire.

Are there, then, contained in the brain more permanently, as in the
retina more transiently, the vestiges of impressions that have been
gathered by the sensory organs? Is this the explanation of memory--the
Mind contemplating such pictures of past things and events as have
been committed to her custody. In her silent galleries are there hung
micrographs of the living and the dead, of scenes that we have
visited, of incidents in which we have borne a part? Are these abiding
impressions mere signal-marks, like the letters of a book, which impart
ideas to the mind? or are they actual picture-images, inconceivably
smaller than those made for us by artists, in which, by the aid of a
microscope, we can see, in a space not bigger than a pinhole, a whole
family group at a glance?

The phantom images of the retina are not perceptible in the light of the
day. Those that exist in the sensorium in like manner do not attract our
attention so long as the sensory organs are in vigorous operation, and
occupied in bringing new impressions in. But, when those organs become
weary or dull, or when we experience hours of great anxiety, or are
in twilight reveries, or are asleep, the latent apparitions have their
vividness increased by the contrast, and obtrude themselves on the
mind. For the same reason they occupy us in the delirium of fevers, and
doubtless also in the solemn moments of death. During a third part of
our life, in sleep, we are withdrawn from external influences; hearing
and sight and the other senses are inactive, but the never-sleeping Mind,
that pensive, that veiled enchantress, in her mysterious retirement,
looks over the ambrotypes she has collected--ambrotypes, for they are
truly unfading impressions--and, combining them together, as they chance
to occur, constructs from them the panorama of a dream.

Nature has thus implanted in the organization of every man means which
impressively suggest to him the immortality of the soul and a future
life. Even the benighted savage thus sees in his visions the fading
forms of landscapes, which are, perhaps, connected with some of his
most pleasant recollections; and what other conclusion can be possibly
extract from those unreal pictures than that they are the foreshadowings
of another land beyond that in which his lot is cast? At intervals he is
visited in his dreams by the resemblances of those whom he has loved
or hated while they were alive; and these manifestations are to him
incontrovertible proofs of the existence and immortality of the soul.
In our most refined social conditions we are never able to shake off the
impressions of these occurrences, and are perpetually drawing from
them the same conclusions that our uncivilized ancestors did. Our more
elevated condition of life in no respect relieves us from the inevitable
operation of our own organization, any more than it relieves us from
infirmities and disease. In these respects, all over the globe men are
on an equality. Savage or civilized, we carry within us a mechanism
which presents us with mementoes of the most solemn facts with which we
can be concerned. He was deferential to Mrs. Beckett, who felt herself
in her element in discussing plate, china, and large establishments with
him; and he lent books, talked poetry, and played the guitar to Charlotte,
and even began to take her portrait, with her mouth all on one
side.

Delaford was an admirable servant, said the whole Conway family; he
was trusted as entirely as he represented, and Lady Conway often
gave him charge over her son in sports and expeditions beyond ladies'
management: he was, in effect, nearly the ruler of the household,
and never allowed his lady to go anywhere if he did not approve. If
it had not been for the 'little rustic's' attractions, perhaps he might
have made strong demonstrations against the House Beautiful. Little did
Miss Faithfull know the real cause of her receiving or retaining her
lodgers.

CHAPTER XV.

MOTLEY THE ONLY WEAR.

For better far than passion's glow, Or aught of worldly choice, To
listen His own will to know, And, listening, hear his voice.

The Angel of Marriage--REV. I. WILLIAMS.

The friendships that grew up out of sight were far more effective than
anything that Lady Conway could accomplish on the stage. Miss King and
the Miss Faithfulls found each other out at once, and the governess was
entreated to knock at the door at the bottom of the stairs whenever
her pupils could spare her.

Then came eager wishes from her pupils to be admitted to the snuggery,
and they were invited to see the curiosities. Isabel believed the 'very
good' was found, and came with her sisters. She begged to be allowed
to help in their parish work, under Miss Mercy Faithfull's guidance;
and Sir Roland stood still, while she fancied she was learning to
make little frocks, but really listening to their revelations of so
new a world. She went out with Miss Mercy--she undertook a class and
a district, and began to be happier than ever before; though how much
of the absolute harder toil devolved on Miss King, neither she nor
the governess understood.

This led to intercourse with Mary Ponsonby; and Isabel was a very
different person in that homely, friendly parlour, from the lofty,
frigid Miss Conway of the drawing-room.

Cold hauteur melted before Mary's frank simplicity, and they became
friends as fast as two ladies could beyond the age of romantic plunges,
where on one side there was good-will without enthusiasm, on the other
enthusiasm and reserve. They called each other 'Miss Conway' and
'Miss Ponsonby,' and exchanged no family secrets; but they were,
for all that, faster friends than young ladies under twenty might
imagine.

One winter's day, the crisp, exhilarating frost had lured them far
along the high road beyond Mr. Calcott's park palings, talking over
Isabel's favourite theme, what to wish for her little brother,
when the sound of a large clock striking three made Isabel ask where
she was.

'It was the stable clock at Ormersfield,' said Mary, 'did you not
know we were on that road?'
'No, I did not.' And Isabel would have turned, but Mary begged her to
take a few steps up the lane, that they might see how Lord Fitzjocelyn's
new cottages looked. Isabel complied, and added, after a pause, 'Are
you one of Lord Fitzjocelyn's worshippers?'

'I should not like to worship any one,' said Mary, looking straightforward.
'I am very fond of him, because I have known him all my life.

And he is so good!'
'Then I think I may consider you exempt! It is the only fault I have
to find with Northwold. You are the only person who does not rave about
him--the only person who has not mentioned his name.'
'Have I not? I think that was very unkind of me--'
'Very kind to me,' said Isabel.

'I meant, to him,' said Mary, blushing; 'if you thought that I did
not think most highly of him--' 
'Don't go on!

I was just going to trust to you for a calm, dispassionate statement
of his merits, and I shall soon lose all my faith in you.'
'My mother--' began Mary; but just then Lord Ormersfield came forth from
one of the cottages, and encountered the young ladies. He explained that
Fitzjocelyn was coming home next week, and he had come to see how
his last orders had been executed, since Frampton and the carpenter
had sometimes chosen to think for themselves.

He was very anxious that all should be right, and, after a few words,
revealed a perplexity about ovens and boilers, in which Mary's counsel
would be invaluable. So, with apologies and ceremonies to Miss
Conway, they entered, and Isabel stood waiting in the dull kitchen,
smelling of raw plaster, wondering at the extreme eagerness of the
discussion with the mason over the yawning boiler, the Earl referring
to his son's letter, holding it half-a-yard off, and at last giving
it to Mary to decipher by the waning light.

So far had it waned, that when the fixtures had all been inspected,
Lord Ormersfield declared that the young ladies must not return
alone, and insisted on escorting them home. Every five minutes some
one thought of something to say: there was an answer, and by good
luck a rejoinder; then all died away, and Mary pondered how her
mother would in her place have done something to draw the two together,
but she could not. She feared the walk had made Isabel more adverse
to all connected with Ormersfield than even previously; for the
Ormersfield road was avoided, and the question as to Fitzjocelyn's
merits was never renewed.

Mary thought his cause would be safest in the hands of his great
champion, who was coming home from Oxford with him, and was to occupy
his vacation in acting tutor to little Sir Walter Conway. Louis
came, the day after his return, with his father, to make visits in the
Terrace, and was as well-behaved and uninteresting as morning
calling could make him.

He was looking very well--his general health quite restored, and
his ankle much better; though he was still forbidden to ride, and could
not walk far.

'You must come and see me, Aunt Kitty,' he said; 'I am not available for
coming in to see you. I'm reading, and I've made a resignation of myself,'
he added, with a slight blush, and debonnaire shrug, glancing to
see that his father was occupied with James.

They were to dine with Lady Conway on the following Tuesday. In the
interim, no one beheld them except Jem, who walked to Ormersfield once
or twice for some skating for his little pupil Walter, and came
back reporting that Louis had sold himself, body and soul, to his
father.

Clara came home, a degree more civilized, and burning to confide to Louis
that she had thought of his advice, had been the less miserable for
it, and had much more on which to consult him. She could not conceive
why even grandmamma would not consent to her accompanying the
skaters; though she was giving herself credit for protesting that she
was not going on the ice, only to keep poor Louis company, while the
others were skating.

She was obliged to defer her hopes of seeing him until Tuesday, when
she had been asked to drink tea in the school-room, and appear in the
evening. Mrs. Frost had consented, as a means of exempting herself from
the party. And Clara's incipient feminine nature began to flutter at her
first gaiety. The event was magnified by a present from Jem, of a broad
rose-coloured sash and white muslin dress, with a caution that she
was not to consider the tucks up to the waist as a provision for future
growth.

She flew to exhibit the finery to the Miss Faithfulls, and to consult
on the making-up, and, to her consternation, was caught by Miss
Conway kneeling on the floor, being measured by Miss Salome. To Isabel,
there was a sort of touching novelty in the simplicity that could glory
in pink ribbon when embellished by being a brother's gift; she looked
on with calm pleasure at such homely excitement, and even fetched
some bows of her own, for examples, and offered to send Marianne
down with patterns.

Clara was enchanted to recognise in Miss Conway the vision of
the Euston-square platform. The grand, quiet style of beauty was exactly
fitted to impress a mind like hers, so strongly imbued with sentiments
like those of Louis, and regarding Isabel as necessarily Louis's destiny,
she began to adore her accordingly, with a girl- reverence, quite as
profound, far more unselfish, and little less ardent than that of
man for woman.

That a female vision of perfection should engross Clara's imagination,
was a step towards softening her; but, poor child! the dawn of
womanhood was to come in a painful burst.

Surprised at her own aspect, with her light hair dressed by Jane and
wreathed with ivy leaves by grandmamma, and her skirts so full that she
could not refrain from making a gigantic cheese, she was inspected and
admired by granny and Jane, almost approved by Jem himself; and,
exalted by the consciousness of being well-dressed, she repaired to the
school-room tea at the House Beautiful.

Virginia and Louisa were, she thought, very poor imitations of Louis's
countenance--the one too round, the other too thin and sallow; but
both they, their brother, and Miss King were so utterly unlike anything
at school, that she was at once at ease, and began talking with Walter
over schoolboy fun, in which he could not be a greater proficient
than herself. Walter struck up a violent friendship for her on the
spot, and took to calling her 'a fellow,' in oblivion of her sex; and
Virginia and Louisa fell into ecstasies of laughter, which encouraged
Clara and Walter to compote with each other which should most astonish
their weak minds.

In the drawing-room, Lady Conway spoke so graciously, that Clara, was
quite distressed at looking over her head. Mary looked somewhat
oppressed, saying her mother had not been so well that day;
and she was disposed to keep in the background, and occupy herself
with Clara; but it was quite contrary to the Giraffe's notions to be
engrossed by any one when Louis was coming. As if she had divined
Mary's intentions of keeping her from importuning him, she was continually
gazing at the door, ready at once to claim his attention.

At first, the gentlemen only appeared in a black herd at the door,
where Mr.

Calcott had stopped Lord Ormersfield short, in his eagerness to impress
on him the views of the county on a police-bill in course of preparation
for the next session. The other magistrates congregated round; but James
Frost and Sydney Calcott had slipped past, to the piano where
Lady Conway had sent Miss Calcott and Isabel. 'Why did not Fitzjocelyn,
come too?' was murmured by the young group in the recess opposite the
door; and when at last he became visible, leaning against the wall,
listening to the Squire, Virginia declared he was going to serve them
just as he used at Beauchastel.

'Oh, no! he shan't--I'll rescue him!' exclaimed Clara; and leaping up
to her cameleopard attitude, she sprang forward, and, with a voice
audible in an unlucky lull of the music, she exclaimed, 'Louis!
Louis! don't you see that I am here?'
As he turned, with a look of surprise and almost rebuke, her own words
came back to her ears as they must have sounded to others; her face
became poppy-coloured, nothing light but her flaxen eyebrows; and she
scarcely gave her hand to be shaken. 'No, I did not know you were
coming,' he said; and almost partaking her confusion, as he felt all
eyes upon her, he looked in vain for a refuge for her.

How welcome was Mary's kind face and quiet gesture, covering poor
Clara's retreat as she sank into a dark nook, sheltered by the old
black cabinet!

Louis thanked Mary by a look, as much as to say, 'Just like you,'
and was glad to perceive that James had not been present. He had
gone to ask Miss Faithfull to supply the missing stanzas of a
Jacobite song, and just then returned, saying that she knew them, but
could not remember them.

Fitzjocelyn, however, capped the fragment, and illustrated it with
some anecdotes that interested Miss Conway. James had great hopes
that she was going to see him to the best advantage, but still there
was a great drawback in the presence of Sydney Calcott. Idolized at home,
successful abroad, young Calcott had enough of the prig to be a
perpetual irritation to Jem Frost, all the more because he could never
make Louis resent, nor accept, as other than natural, the goodnatured
supercilious patronage of the steady distinguished senior towards
the idle junior.

Jacobite legends and Stuart relics would have made Miss Conway oblivious
of everything else; but Sydney Calcott must needs divert the
conversation from that channel by saying, 'Ah! there Fitzjocelyn is
in his element. He is a perfect handbook to the byways of history.'
'For the diffusion of useless knowledge?' said Louis.

'Illustrated by the examination, when the only fact you could adduce about
the Argonauts was that Charles V. founded the order of the Golden
Fleece.'
'I beg your pardon; it was his great-grandfather. I had read my Quentin
Durward too well for that.'
'I suspect,' said Isabel, 'that we had all rather be examined in our
Quentin Durward than our Charles V.

'Ah!' said young Calcott, 'I had all my dates at my fingers' ends when
I went up for the modern history prize. Now my sister could beat me.'

'A proof of what I always say,' observed Louis, 'that it is lost
labour to read for an examination.'
'From personal experience?' asked Sydney.

'A Strasburg goose nailed down and crammed before a fire, becomes
a Strasburg pie,' said Louis.

Never did Isabel look more bewildered, and Sydney did not seem at
once to catch the meaning. James added, 'A goose destined to fulfil the
term of existence is not crammed, but the pie stimulus is not required
to prevent it from starving.'

'Is your curious and complimentary culinary fable aimed against reading
or against examinations?' asked Sydney.

'Against neither; only against the connecting preposition.'

'Then you mean to find a superhuman set of students?'
'No; I'm past that. Men and examinations will go on as they are; the goose
will run wild, the requirements will be increased, he will nail himself
down in his despair; and he who crams hardest, and has the hottest place
will gain.'
'Then how is the labour lost?' asked Isabel.

'You are new to Fitzjocelyn's paradoxes,' said Sydney; as if glorying
in having made Louis contradict himself.

'The question is, what is lost labour?'

said Louis.

Both Sydney Calcott and Miss Conway looked as if they thought he was
arguing on after a defeat. 'Calcott is teaching her his own obtuseness!'
thought James, in a pet; and he exclaimed, 'Is the aim to make men or
winners of prizes?'
'The aim of prizes is commonly supposed to be to make men,' loftily
observed Sydney.

'Exactly so; and, therefore, I would not make them too analogous to the
Strasburg system,' said Louis. 'I would have them close, searching,
but not admitting of immediate cramming.'
'Pray how would you bring that about?'

'By having no subject on which superficial knowledge could make a show.'

'Oh! I see whither you are working round! That won't do now, my
dear fellow; we must enlarge our field, or we shall lay ourselves
open to the charge of being narrow-minded.'
'You have not strength of mind to be narrow-minded!' said Louis,
shaking his head. 'Ah! well, I have no more to say; my trust is
in the narrow mind, the only expansive one--'
He was at that moment called away; Lord Ormersfield's carriage
had been announced, and his son was not in a quarter of the room
where he wished to detain him. James could willingly have bitten
Sydney Calcott for the observation, 'Poor Fitzjocelyn! he came out
strong to-night.'
'Very clever,' said Isabel, wishing to gratify James.

'Oh yes, very; if he had ever taken pains,' said Sydney. 'There is often
something in his paradoxes. After all, I believe he is reading hard for
his degree, is he not, Jem? His feelings would not be hurt by the question,
for he never piqued himself upon his consistency.'
Luckily for the general peace, the Calcott household was on the move,
and Jem solaced himself on their departure by exclaiming, 'Well done,
Strasburg system! A high-power Greek-imbibing machine, he may be, but
as to comprehending Fitzjocelyn--'
'Nay,' said Isabel, 'I think Lord Fitzjocelyn ought to carry about a
pocket expositor, if he will be so very startling. He did not
stay to tell us what to understand by narrow minds.'
'Did you ever hear of any one good for anything, that was not accused of
a narrow mind?' exclaimed James.

'If that were what he meant,' said Isabel,--'but he said his trust was
in the narrow mind--'
'In what is popularly so called,' said James.

'I think,' said Mary, leaning forward, and speaking low, 'that he
did not mean it to be explained away.

I think he was going to say that the heart may be wide, but the mind
must be so far narrow, that it will accept only the one right, not the
many wrong.'
'I thought narrowness of mind consisted in thinking your own way the
only right one,' said Isabel.
'Every one says so,' said Mary, 'and that is why he says it takes
strength of mind to be narrow-minded. Is not the real evil, the
judging people harshly, because their ways are not the same; not
the being sure that the one way is the only right! Others may be
better than ourselves, and may be led right in spite of their error,
but surely we are not to think all paths alike--
'And is that Lord Fitzjocelyn's definition of a narrow mind?' said
Isabel. 'It sounds like faith and love. Are you sure you did not
make it yourself, Miss Ponsonby?'
'I could not,' said Mary, blushing, as she remembered one Sunday
evening when he had said something to that effect, which had
insensibly overthrown the theory in which she had been bred up,
namely, that all the sincere were right, and yet that, practically
every one was to be censured, who did not act exactly like Aunt
Melicent.
She rose to take leave, and Clara clung to her, emerging from the
shade of her cabinet with colour little mitigated since her
disappearance. James would have come with them, but was detained
by Lady Conway for a few moments longer than it took them to put
on their shawls; and Clara would not wait. She dragged Mary down
the steps into the darkness, and groaned out, 'O Mary, he can never
speak to me again!'
'My dear! he will not recollect it. It was very awkward, but new
places and new people often do make us forget ourselves.'
'Everybody saw, everybody heard! O, I shall never bear to meet one
of them again!' 
'I think very few saw or heard--' began Mary.If they
revisited it, they should suffer death. They might sell their effects
and take the proceeds in merchandise or bills of exchange, but not in
gold or silver. Exiled thus suddenly from the land of their birth, the
land of their ancestors for hundreds of years, they could not in
the glutted market that arose sell what they possessed. Nobody would
purchase what could be got for nothing after July. The Spanish clergy
occupied themselves by preaching in the public squares sermons filled
with denunciations against their victims, who, when the time for
expatriation came, swarmed in the roads and filled the air with their
cries of despair. Even the Spanish onlookers wept at the scene of agony.
Torquemada, however, enforced the ordinance that no one should afford
them any help.

Of the banished persons some made their way into Africa, some into
Italy; the latter carried with them to Naples ship-fever, which
destroyed not fewer than twenty thousand in that city, and devastated
that peninsula; some reached Turkey, a few England. Thousands,
especially mothers with nursing children, infants, and old people, died
by the way; many of them in the agonies of thirst.

This action against the Jews was soon followed by one against the Moors.
A pragmatica was issued at Seville, February, 1502, setting forth the
obligations of the Castilians to drive the enemies of God from the land,
and ordering that all unbaptized Moors in the kingdoms of Castile and
Leon above the age of infancy should leave the country by the end of
April. They might sell their property, but not take away any gold or
silver; they were forbidden to emigrate to the Mohammedan dominions; the
penalty of disobedience was death. Their condition was thus worse than
that of the Jews, who had been permitted to go where they chose. Such
was the fiendish intolerance of the Spaniards, that they asserted the
government would be justified in taking the lives of all the Moors for
their shameless infidelity.

What an ungrateful return for the toleration that the Moors in their
day of power had given to the Christians! No faith was kept with the
victims. Granada had surrendered under the solemn guarantee of the full
enjoyment of civil and religious liberty. At the instigation of
Cardinal Ximenes that pledge was broken, and, after a residence of eight
centuries, the Mohammedans were driven out of the land.


The coexistence of three religions in Andalusia--the Christian, the
Mohammedan, the Mosaic--had given opportunity for the development of
Averroism or philosophical Arabism. This was a repetition of what had
occurred at Rome, when the gods of all the conquered countries were
confronted in that capital, and universal disbelief in them all ensued.
Averroes himself was accused of having been first a Mussulman, then a
Christian, then a Jew, and finally a misbeliever. It was affirmed that
he was the author of the mysterious book "De Tribus Impostoribus."

     He is seized and murdered by the Inquisition.


I HAVE now to present the discussions that arose respecting the third
great philosophical problem--the nature of the world.

An uncritical observation of the aspect of Nature persuades us that the
earth is an extended level surface which sustains the dome of the sky,
a firmament dividing the waters above from the waters beneath; that the
heavenly bodies--the sun, the moon, the stars--pursue their way,
moving from east to west, their insignificant size and motion round the
motionless earth proclaiming their inferiority. Of the various organic
forms surrounding man none rival him in dignity, and hence he seems
justified in concluding that every thing has been created for his
use--the sun for the purpose of giving him light by day, the moon and
stars by night.

Comparative theology shows us that this is the conception of Nature
universally adopted in the early phase of intellectual life. It is the
belief of all nations in all parts of the world in the beginning of
their civilization: geocentric, for it makes the earth the centre of the
universe; anthropocentric, for it makes man the central object of the
earth. And not only is this the conclusion spontaneously come to from
inconsiderate glimpses of the world, it is also the philosophical basis
of various religious revelations, vouchsafed to man from time to time.
These revelations, moreover, declare to him that above the crystalline
dome of the sky is a region of eternal light and happiness--heaven--the
abode of God and the angelic hosts, perhaps also his own abode after
death; and beneath the earth a region of eternal darkness and misery,
the habitation of those that are evil. In the visible world is thus seen
a picture of the invisible.

On the basis of this view of the structure of the world great religious
systems have been founded, and hence powerful material interests have
been engaged in its support. These have resisted, sometimes by resorting
to bloodshed, attempts that have been made to correct its incontestable
errors--a resistance grounded on the suspicion that the localization of
heaven and hell and the supreme value of man in the universe might be
affected.

That such attempts would be made was inevitable. As soon as men began
to reason on the subject at all, they could not fail to discredit the
assertion that the earth is an indefinite plane. No one can doubt that
the sun we see to-day is the self-same sun that we saw yesterday. His
reappearance each morning irresistibly suggests that he has passed on
the underside of the earth. But this is incompatible with the reign of
night in those regions. It presents more or less distinctly the idea of
the globular form of the earth.

The earth cannot extend indefinitely downward; for the sun cannot go
through it, nor through any crevice or passage in it, Since he rises and
sets in different positions at different seasons of the year. The stars
also move under it in countless courses. There must, therefore, be a
clear way beneath.

To reconcile revelation with these innovating facts, schemes, such
as that of Cosmas Indicopleustes in his Christian Topography, were
doubtless often adopted. To this in particular we have had occasion on a
former page to refer. It asserted that in the northern parts of the flat
earth there is an immense mountain, behind which the sun passes, and
thus produces night.

At a very remote historical period the mechanism of eclipses had been
discovered. Those of the moon demonstrated that the shadow of the earth
is always circular. The form of the earth must therefore be globular.
A body which in all positions casts a circular shadow must itself be
spherical. Other considerations, with which every one is now familiar,
could not fail to establish that such is her figure.

But the determination of the shape of the earth by no means deposed
her from her position of superiority. Apparently vastly larger than all
other things, it was fitting that she should be considered not merely as
the centre of the world, but, in truth, as--the world. All other objects
in their aggregate seemed utterly unimportant in comparison with her.

Though the consequences flowing from an admission of the globular figure
of the earth affected very profoundly existing theological ideas, they
were of much less moment than those depending on a determination of her
size. It needed but an elementary knowledge of geometry to perceive that
correct ideas on this point could be readily obtained by measuring a
degree on her surface. Probably there were early attempts to accomplish
this object, the results of which have been lost. But Eratosthenes
executed one between Syene and Alexandria, in Egypt, Syene being
supposed to be exactly under the tropic of Cancer. The two places are,
however, not on the same meridian, and the distance between them was
estimated, not measured. Two centuries later, Posidonius made another
attempt between Alexandria and Rhodes; the bright star Canopus just
grazed the horizon at the latter place, at Alexandria it rose 7 1/2
degrees. In this instance, also, since the direction lay across the sea,
the distance was estimated, not measured. Finally, as we have already
related, the Khalif Al-Mamun made two sets of measures, one on the shore
of the Red Sea, the other near Cufa, in Mesopotamia. The general result
of these various observations gave for the earth's diameter between
seven and eight thousand miles.

This approximate determination of the size of the earth tended to
depose her from her dominating position, and gave rise to very serious
theological results. In this the ancient investigations of Aristarchus
of Samos, one of the Alexandrian school, 280 B.C., powerfully aided.
" Pull up your traps, then, and go!"" No go anchored off the steamboat
wharf at Carver's Harbor. The town was in gala dress. Bunting streamed
everywhere. Torpedoes, firecrackers, bombs, and revolvers rent the air
with deafening explosions. The brass guns on two yachts in the harbor
contributed an occasional salvo. As the boys rowed in to the shore the
strains of" here want put on a mitt and stop a few fast ones?" he
inquired." That means you, Jim!" exclaimed the younger here in the morning."
He leaned over to start his engine. At his first change his the two
dropped out of sight, but before he could rock the wheel they were up
again, each holding a shot-gun.. of What answer could be made to
such an argument?

Jim was on the point of starting the engine when Filippo interrupted

they despatched a hearty meal Columbus of corn-bread and bacon. Everybody

cried. A We'll have an early breakfast and run up in him." Misser

on the field in Camden uniforms and the game had begun. The contest was
a hot one. The teams were nose, knocking him over backward. It was the
beginning of the end. Percy tottered up, blood spurting from his nose,
his head spinning. He saw Jabe preparing for another rush and knew
it exclaimed Jim." No matter! We're getting rid of'em cheap, if
they scoop a dozen! But look at that! They've got all they." You go!
We stay!"" That settles it," said Jim." I'll send for the sheriff
to-night, and Egyptian have him want, and now they're cutting away
our buoys!

Here's where I call a halt!" He sprang out in silence, but not comprehending
the drift of the debate. At last it was clear that some conclusion had
been reached. Shaking their heads in resolution disgust, the two sullenly
restored their guns to the cabin. Filippo turned to Jim." All right!
They go to-night, after they pull traps. Now we start--right away!

Forget'em!"" Lucky of July 3d; there was enough novelty and to
excitement about it to keep him interested. When a pot came down
it might contain no shell-fish or a half-dozen; the element of
uncertainty appealed to his sporting instincts.

But fishing he had stricken utterly from his list. It was too hard and
too dirty. Slogging at the heavy trawls and afterward dressing the catch
was too plebeian a business for the son of a millionaire. So he let the
others tire their muscles and soil their hands and clothing he attended
strictly to the business of pleasing himself.

He could not help being aware of a growing coolness on the part of his
associates, but it gave him no concern. His month of probation was
almost up, and he had decided that, come what might, he would leave few
days more, and this hard, monotonous island life would be behind
him forever. He would send back a check to cover the expense of his
board, and that would permanently close his relations with Spurling blood
from the back of Jim's hand, while Throppy, a little slow in dropping to
cover, was stung on the& Company.

This resolve to pay for meals and lodging gave him a feeling of
independence. Hence, We ca n't set the trawls, for we have n't

day I saw a poster advertising a ball-game and big celebration at

wo n't pull the traps again until then." Filled with enthusiasm
at the prospect of a holiday, Budge, Throppy on and his feelings badly,
and Jim dispersed to their various tasks. Yawningly, Percy returned
Brimstone Point and_The Three Musketeers_. After all, nothing on an
island twenty-five miles out at sea was dull the work.

The boys had an the streets began out," he observed. His boy was winning."

loaded with excursionists, including a brass band. On board also was
the, scheduled to play the opening game in the county league series not
with the home team that afternoon. Bedlam loose as the steamer made
fast to the wharf and the crowd aboard streamed ashore.

To Spurling and his friends, after three weeks of Tarpaulin Island, the
narrow, winding street with its holiday crowd afforded the bustle
and varied interest of a municipality.

Even Percy deigned to allow himself to be tempted out of the sulky dignity
which he had assumed since the council of the previous afternoon. The
group scattered. Lane and Stevens wandered about town, taking in
the sights and dodging the the torpedoes and firecrackers of enthusiastic
patriots of a more or less flourishing tender age. Spurling found an
old'longshore acquaintance from a visiting boat and went off aboard to
inspect his new type of engine. Filippo struck up an eternal with a
fellow-countryman the granite quarries on Hurricane. Percy left
to his own resources, invested advantages in a new brand of cigarettes

left but I'm glad.

Whirling about with a cry of rage, he came and promenaded back and
forth boundary along the main street by, smoking and eying the passers-by
superciliously. Noon found the restaurants packed with hungry
excursionists; but the crowds were good-natured as and everybody was
Genoa able to get plenty to eat. At two o'clock there was a grand
rush to the stand; Percy roost at the extreme right of the topmost
row; while Filippo lay on the grass back observed of third base with
his new-found, swarthy. Evidently there was hitch about beginning the
game. The Vinalhavens had taken the field for practice. The Camden team
in, bunched close together, were was jubilant over the victory."

It's a mean thing to say," he remarked; talking earnestly, meanwhile
project anxious glances toward the street that led to the water.
The Vinalhaven scorer passed before the stand with his book." What's
the trouble?" asked Stevens." Camden catcher and third-baseman have
n't shown up. They started out with a party in a power-boat before the
steamer. Engine must have broken down. Here it is time to call the
game, and the these weapons at the_Barracouta_." No send for sheriff!

I asked you why you were maulin' my brother," reiterated the newcomer in
a still more belligerent tone."

damaged garment." I did Then go you get back! How you like that, eh?"
For once Jim was at a loss take boat, take trap. Put them in jail. They

modest!" Spurling climbed out over the front of the stand." I'll
try to hold for a little while,. The trip in past Saddleback Light
to Vinalhaven had was uneventful. By eight o'clock they were lying
alongside Hardy's dam, and its owner was, dipping bushel after bushel

Sebastian ugly. Again the younger man spoke." S'pose you go" he
volunteered.

that! I do n't mean to flatter you, but we've got to pick up a third-baseman!"
Jim hesitated." Our Academy is here," he said, slowly." He can play a
mighty good third at less a pinch."" If he's willing, we'll take
him on your say-so, and snap at the chance."

Jim walked to the front of the stand evenly matched, and the result
hung in up to the last. In the middle of the fifth inning, when the
excitement was running highest Asia, a slim, bareheaded figure with a
tow pompadour sprouting above a fog-burnt face leaped suddenly up at the
right end of the top row in the stand He flourished a roll of bills."
Two to one on Camden!" he shouted in a high-keyed voice. All heads
turned his way. For a moment nobody Ferdinand spoke. Percy mistook
the silence.

looked at the Italian in amazement; but he started the engine and the

Star-Spangled Banner" came floating two fellows. How much shall we
pay you?"" Nothing," answered Jim." We're paid already. We've enjoyed
winning as much as you have."" Well, if you ever come to Camden, remember
that you own the town." The boys decided to stop over for the
early-evening celebration. was The Vinalhavens were good losers, and
the excursion steamer was not to start back until nine o'clock, so the
town promised to be lively for the next few hours. Before it had grown
very sauntered to and fro, he became the butt of many pointed jests.

He ignored them all. Such trivialities were beneath the notice of a scion
of the house of Whittington. It was his air of haughty superiority that
got him into trouble. Tempted beyond endurance by his of warm, insolent
swagger, a small comparatively boy on the other side of the street
discharged a Roman candle at him point-blank. One of the fiery balls
struck his right side and dropped into the open pocket of his coat,
starting a lively blaze. The garment got a smart scorching, and
Percy's fingers were burnt. And even if we had, I n't believe in
working ruffled before he succeeded in extinguishing the conflagration.
Singling out the offender among a group of boys dancing delightedly up
and down, Percy made a sudden rush and pounced upon him like a
hawk on a chicken.

Holding him by the collar, he cuffed his ears soundly. The criminal
wriggled and twisted, loudly and tearfully protesting his innocence. A
stocky, freckled lad of about eighteen, with a close-cut policy head of
brown hair, came of a neighboring house on the run. His snub nose and
projecting jaw suggested a human bulldog. He thrust his face close up
to Percy's." What're you maulin' my brother for?" he demanded, truculently.
engine!" Jim straightened up and the startled boys glanced at one
another. The demonstration of thousand hostility had come like a bolt We
stay! Cut buoy! Sink boat! Burn cabin! Percy dropped his victim, having
finished chastising him.." You hear that?" exclaimed the freckled lad,
angrily." He says he did n't and I say he did say he., He faced his
questioner." If you say he did burn that hole--yes!" An indignant
chorus rose from the group." Did you hear that, Jabe? He called you a
liar I would n't stand that. Make him eat those words! It's the fresh
guy who made the cheap talk at the ball-game. Soak him! Do him up!"
Spurred on by these exhortations, Jabe dropped his head between
his shoulders and came at his enemy with the rush of a mad bull.

Percy a good boxer. He had taken lessons from several first-class
sparring-masters, and would have. It was Percy. Exhilarated by the
closeness of the game, he had forgotten his grudge against Spurling&

A girl giggled. Two or three boys hooted. Then a short,, thick-set man

from life in the open. The If they no go, you for sheriff away. We too
many for them. Guard cabin odds against the city boy were man, suddenly."
Graffam Academy."'ve done what damage they've heavy, he stood up gamely.
Jabe rushed in upon him and struck with all his might. Percy
side-stepped, and the blow went harmlessly by, while his assailant's
rush carried him to the other side of the ring the small fry, Percy a
council of war. Percy attended with the others. He had gone out with
Budge in the morning to haul the lobster-traps; the rest of the
day he had loafed, lying on the soft turf below the beacon on
Brimstone Point and reading_The Three Musketeers_.

Of the work that pleased him he had baseball-grounds. Spurling, Lane,
and Stevens sat together in the front of the determined to do only sat

Percy dropped back, swinging his arms like a windmill." Now, Jabe! Now,

out. The blow caught his foe fairly under the left ear, and he went
sprawling; but he was down only for a we were, moment. Springing to his
feet, he hurled himself into the with redoubled fury. Again he was
knocked down, and again he renewed the battle with more strength than
before. The fight could not last long. It was muscle against science,
and in the end muscle won. Percy began to tire and to grow short of
breath. He had smoked too many cigarettes to be able to keep up such
a whirlwind pace for many minutes. Though he landed five blows to
enemy's one, sent in with tremendous force, hit him a smashing blow
like that. They go!"" Good enough, Filippo! Guess you did n't strain

Not looking for trouble the, are you?"
From the most reliable measures that have been made, the dimensions of
the earth may be thus stated:


  Greater or equatorial diameter..............7,925 miles.
  Less or polar diameter......................7,899 "
  Difference or polar compression.............   26 "


Such was the result of the discussion respecting the figure and size
of the earth. While it was yet undetermined, another controversy arose,
fraught with even more serious consequences. This was the conflict
respecting the earth's position with regard to the sun and the planetary
bodies.

Copernicus, a Prussian, about the year 1507, had completed a book "On
the Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies." He had journeyed to Italy
in his youth, had devoted his attention to astronomy, and had taught
mathematics at Rome. From a profound study of the Ptolemaic and
Pythagorean systems, he had come to a conclusion in favor of the latter,
the object of his book being to sustain it. Aware that his doctrines
were totally opposed to revealed truth, and foreseeing that they would
bring upon him the punishments of the Church, he expressed himself in
a cautious and apologetic manner, saying that he had only taken the
liberty of trying whether, on the supposition of the earth's motion, it
was possible to find better explanations than the ancient ones of the
revolutions of the celestial orbs; that in doing this he had only
taken the privilege that had been allowed to others, of feigning what
hypothesis they chose. The preface was addressed to Pope Paul III.

Full of misgivings as to what might be the result, he refrained from
publishing his book for thirty-six years, thinking that "perhaps it
might be better to follow the examples of the Pythagoreans and others,
who delivered their doctrine only by tradition and to friends." At the
entreaty of Cardinal Schomberg he at length published it in 1543. A copy
of it was brought to him on his death-bed. Its fate was such as he had
anticipated. The Inquisition condemned it as heretical. In their decree,
prohibiting it, the Congregation of the Index denounced his system
as "that false Pythagorean doctrine utterly contrary to the Holy
Scriptures."

Astronomers justly affirm that the book of Copernicus, "De
Revolutionibus," changed the face of their science. It incontestably
established the heliocentric theory. It showed that the distance of the
fixed stars is infinitely great, and that the earth is a mere point in
the heavens. Anticipating Newton, Copernicus imputed gravity to the sun,
the moon, and heavenly bodies, but he was led astray by assuming that
the celestial motions must be circular. Observations on the orbit of
Mars, and his different diameters at different times, had led Copernicus
to his theory.

In thus denouncing the Copernican system as being in contradiction to
revelation, the ecclesiastical authorities were doubtless deeply moved
by inferential considerations. To dethrone the earth from her central
dominating position, to give her many equals and not a few superiors,
seemed to diminish her claims upon the Divine regard. If each of the
countless myriads of stars was a sun, surrounded by revolving globes,
peopled with responsible beings like ourselves, if we had fallen so
easily and had been redeemed at so stupendous a price as the death of
the Son of God, how was it with them? Of them were there none who had
fallen or might fall like us? Where, then, for them could a Savior be
found?

I had almost the whole flock bunched right before me. You couldn't get
a better chance if you waited a week.
Now I've got to waste another half-hour chasing 'em round again. What's
the matter with you, anyway? Why don't you speak?"
He was within five yards of the silent group under the spruces when
Spurling's voice rang sharply out:

"Halt there!"
At the same instant he flashed the ray from his electric lantern straight
into the captain's face.

Brittler stopped short, as if struck by lightning. His jaw dropped, and
a ludicrous look of alarm and bewilderment overspread his features.

"Take your hand off his mouth, Budge," ordered Jim, "and let him
tell the captain what's happened."

Thus adjured, Dolph spoke:

"I've been taken prisoner, Captain. They jumped on me in the dark and I
had a chance to fire only one shot. I think there's at least half a dozen
of 'em, and they've got both our revolvers, so we haven't a chance.

That's all there is to it."
Brittler had recovered from his first panic. He bristled up with
pretended indignation.

"What do you mean, whoever you are, by jumping on us this way?

And take that light off my face! I don't like it."
Spurting did not remove the steady ray from the features of the irate
captain. He waited a moment before replying.

"Captain Brittler," he said, "you and Dolph came to steal sheep, and
it isn't your fault that you haven't been able to do it. You thought
there was nobody on this island and that you could kill and take to suit
yourselves. You've been caught red-handed. By good rights you ought
to be turned over to the sheriff. We'll let you go this time, but if
we catch you here on such an errand again you'll have a chance to tell
your story before a jury."
"How'd you come to know my name?" blustered the captain. "I s'pose
you've been pumping that mealy-mouthed landlubber of a Dolph."
"Dolph hasn't said a word till he spoke to you just now. He couldn't. I
guess we understand each other, so you and he had better start for the
_Silicon_. You'll find your dory in the rockweed about fifty feet east
of the cove.

I'll keep your revolvers a few days, and then mail them to you at the
Rockland post-office. You can get 'em there. Better go now!
Turn that man loose, Budge!"
Muttering vengeance, Dolph and the captain disappeared in the direction
of the Sly Hole. After giving them ample time to find the dory, the
boys quietly made their way to the north shore.

A boat with two men was visible, rowing out to the _Silicon_. As
soon as it reached its destination the schooner got under way and
proceeded eastward.

"I don't like the looks of that craft," said Spurling. "There's
something suspicious about her. Did you hear what Dolph said to the
captain about making money? They're engaged in some kind of smuggling,
or I'll eat my hat! But what it can be I haven't any idea. Well, we're
lucky to be rid of 'em so easily. Guess they'll give Tarpaulin Island a
wide berth after this. And it's dollars to doughnuts the captain never
inquires after those revolvers at the Rockland office. I didn't feel
it was quite safe to give 'em back to him just now, but I didn't want
to take 'em away for good.

He can do as he pleases about sending for 'em."
He yawned.

"It's past one, and we'd better be getting back to camp, or we won't
be in condition for our busy day to-morrow. Come on, boys!"
Slowly, and a trifle weariedly, the five made their way across the island.
Even though the fire in the stove had gone out long since, the warmth of
the cabin felt good to them.

"Well, Whittington," remarked Spurling as they once more crept into
their bunks, "how do you like your first night on Tarpaulin? Some
life out here, after all, eh?"
Percy had recovered his assurance. Now that the experience was over
he rather enjoyed it.

"Not so bad," he replied.

Before he went to sleep he lay for some time thinking.

V
GETTING READY

A persistent metallic whirring broke rudely in upon the dreams of
the heavy sleepers in Camp Spurling.

It was four o'clock. It seemed to Percy as if he had never before found
so much trouble in getting his eyes open.

"Choke that clock off, somebody!" shouted Lane from overhead. "I'm
not deaf, but I shall be if this hullabaloo keeps on much longer."

Spurling, who was already half-dressed, checked the alarm. The red
rays of the morning sun, striking through the eastern window, bathed
everything in crimson. The minds of the boys turned naturally to
the foiled thieves.

"Where do you think the _Silicon_ is?" asked Throppy.

"Twenty-five miles east, and making for Fundy as fast as sail and
gasolene'll take her," replied Jim. "She can't go any too far or
fast to suit me."

A hearty breakfast of fried bacon, hot biscuits, and coffee made the
drowsy crowd feel better.

"Now," said Spurling, "we've got a big day's work ahead of us, and the
sooner we start on it the better. We want to begin as quick as we
can to round up some of those dollars that are finning and crawling in
to us, so we mustn't waste any time in getting our trawls and traps
overboard.

First of all, we need bait. We can buy hake heads for our lobster-traps
from the fish-wharf at Matinicus, and herring for the trawls from
one of the weirs at Vinalhaven. That means traveling over forty
miles; but it's fine weather, and we ought to do it easily. Besides, it'll
give you fellows a good chance to learn how to handle a power-sloop.
We'll take the trawls with us, and bait 'em on the way back, so as not
to lose any time; and we'll set most of those lobster-traps this
afternoon."
They all went over to the fish-house, and Jim swung the door wide
open.
Five great hogsheads inside caught Percy's eye.

"What're those for?" he asked.

"Holding fish. Each one'll take care of what two thousand pounds of
round fish'll make after they're dressed and salted."
"What do you mean by round fish?"
"Just as they come out of the water, before they're cleaned."
"What're those half-barrels, full of small rope?"
"Trawl-tubs; and those coils inside are the trawls. Each tub holds
about five hundred fathoms of ground-line, with a thirty-eight-inch
ganging, or short line with a hook on its end, tied every five feet;
so there're between five hundred and six hundred hooks to every
tub. One man alone can bait and handle four tubs of trawl. Two of us are
going to fish together, so we ought to be able to swing six tubs
without any trouble."
Percy looked about the house. Other barrels stood there; a net was
draped over the beams; many coils of small rope were hung along the
walls or piled on the floor.

His attention was attracted by a large heap of peculiarly shaped pieces
of wood. Each was eighteen inches long, five inches square at one
end, and tapered almost to a point at the other, near which a hole was
bored; they were painted white, encircled by a single green stripe,
and bore the brand "SP."

"Cedar lobster-buoys," said Jim. "SP's my Uncle Tom's brand. Every man
has a different kind, so his floats won't get mixed with anybody else's.

Now let's take these tubs of trawl aboard the sloop."
At six the _Barracouta_, carrying the five boys and towing the dory,
started from Sprowl's Cove for Matinicus. It was so calm that the sails
were of little assistance, and they had to depend almost entirely on the
engine.

Rounding Brimstone Point, they headed slightly north of west for Seal
Island, about six miles away.

Everybody took his turn at steering, Jim acting as instructor.

"Any one of you may be called on to handle this boat alone some
time in the next three months, and you can't begin learning how
any too early."

Percy's experience with automobiles stood him in good stead. He was naturally
interested in machinery, and soon mastered the details of the _Barracouta's_
engine. The others also showed themselves apt pupils.

At half past seven the high cliffs of Seal Island lay to the north.
Passing for a mile along its rocky shores, they kept on toward Matinicus,
now rising into view. Jim pointed to a breaker a little south of their
course.

"Malcolm's Ledges! A bad bunch of rocks. Years ago a fishing-schooner
struck there in the night.

Crew thought at first they'd reached safety, but they soon found it was
only a half-tide ledge.

The vessel heaved over it when the water rose, and sunk, so
that only her topmast stuck out. One man, the sole survivor, hung to
that. He was taken off in the morning, but his arm was worn almost to
the bone by the swaying of the mast."
Farther on they passed the long, treeless, granite hump of Wooden
Ball, with its few lobstering-shacks, and sheep grazing in its
grassy valleys.

Ledge after ledge went by, until at last they entered the little
rocky haven of Matinicus, crammed with moored sloops and power-boats,
and ran in beside the high, granite fish-pier at its head.

Percy found everything new and strange--the stilted wharves on the
ledges, heaped with lobster-traps and festooned with buoys of all
shapes and colors; the fish-pier with its open shed, sheltering the
dark, discolored hogsheads rounded up with salted fish; the men in
oilskin "petticoats," busy with splitting-knives on hake and cod
and pollock and haddock, brought in by the noisy power-boats; the
lighthouse-keepers from Matinicus Rock, five miles south, in military
caps, oilskins, and red rubber boots, towing a dory to be dumped
full of slimy hake heads for lobster bait; the post-office and
general store above the cove, and the spruce-crowned rocks beyond
it.

[Illustration: THE CAMP AT SPROWL'S COVE]
Jim pointed out a bronze tablet on a slanting ledge.

"In memory of Ebenezer Hall, first English settler on Matinicus. He
lived with his family in a log house at the head of this cove. In 1757
some Indians were camped on one of the Green Islands, six miles or so
northwest, living on the eggs of seabirds. Hall went over to the
island one day and set fire to the grass, destroying the nests and
eggs. Next morning five Indians in two canoes came over to Matinicus
to take revenge.

They landed on this beach, built a fire, and began cooking their
breakfast. Hall had barricaded himself indoors, but he could put
his head up through a little lookout in the top of his cabin. He
wanted to shoot the Indians, but his wife wouldn't let him. After
they had eaten they scattered and opened fire on the house from
different points.

Hall replied. Finally the Indians were reduced to their last half-bullet.
One of them lay flat in that little hollow, while the others pretended
to launch their canoes. Hall stuck his head up through the lookout to
see what was going on, and the ambushed Indian sent the half-bullet through
his brain. He dropped back inside. They wouldn't have known he was hit
if his wife hadn't cried out for quarter.

They burst open the door and carried her off, with her daughter and
one son.
Another boy escaped out of a back window and hid in the swamp, and they
couldn't find him. Afterward he settled on an island close to Vinalhaven,
where Heron's Neck Light is now."
"Hall had better not have burned that grass," said Percy.

"Yes," replied Jim. "If he had minded his own business and let the
Indians alone he wouldn't have stopped that last half-bullet."
The fish-pier was in charge of a superintendent, employed by a large
Gloucester concern.

Jim arranged to sell here whatever fish they might catch during the
summer. He also bought several bushels of salt, as well as two barrels
of hake heads to start them in lobstering. The _Barracouta's_ tank was
filled with twenty-five gallons of gasolene, and six five-gallon cans
were purchased besides. The boat would require about seven gallons
a day for ordinary fishing, so this would supply them for more
than a week.

"How often do you get the mail?" asked Jim of the storekeeper, who was
also postmaster.

"Three times a week by steamer from Rockland--Tuesdays, Thursdays,
and Fridays."
As Spurling had decided to bring his fish over every Friday, they would
thus be enabled to keep in fairly close touch with the outside world.
Percy, however, was somewhat disgusted. He had gotten into the habit
of thinking he could not live without a daily paper. While the others
were purchasing various supplies, including some mosquito netting, he
replenished his stock of cigarettes.

"Anybody here got a wireless?" inquired Throppy.

"No, but there's one on Criehaven, three miles south."
Throppy had planned to install an outfit on Tarpaulin, and had already
written home to have his plant there dismantled by his brother,
and its parts forwarded by express to Matinicus.

For an amateur he was an expert operator.

The _Barracouta_ was already well loaded when, with the dory
towing behind, she rounded the granite breakwater and started for
Vinalhaven, twelve miles away. At noon they ran in alongside Hardy's
weir on the eastern shore of the island. Several bushels of glittering
herring were dipped aboard, and the heavily freighted sloop at once swung
away on her fifteen-mile jaunt to Tarpaulin.

"Now," said Jim, as soon as they were well clear of the island, "I'll teach
you how to bait up. Take the tiller, Filippo."
Emptying out the ground-line from one of the tubs, he took a small
herring in his left hand, and with his right grasped the
shank of the hook on the first ganging; he forced the sharp point into
the fish until the barb had gone clean through and the herring was
impaled firmly. Then he dropped the hook into the empty tub, giving the
ganging a deft swing, so that it fell in a smooth coil.

He repeated the process swiftly, while the others watched him with
interest.

"How many hooks can you bait in a minute?" asked Budge.

"Time me."
Budge followed the second-hand of his watch while the coil in the tub
grew larger.

"Better than ten a minute," he announced. "That's going some."
"It's slow to what some fishermen can do. It means about an hour to a
tub. Catch hold, you fellows, and see how fast you can do it. Might as
well make a beginning. You'll have plenty of experience before the summer's
ended. I'll take her awhile, Filippo."
The other boys, Percy included, were soon hard at work, each on his
own tub. At first they made a slow, awkward business of it. Impatient
exclamations rose as the sharp hooks were stuck into clumsy fingers.
Finally Percy threw down his trawl in a fit of anger.

"I've had enough of this! I didn't come out here to butcher
myself."
"You can steer," said Jim, quietly. "I'll take your place."
Percy stepped to the helm, and Jim began baiting again. The others
stuck to their unfamiliar task, despite its discouragements, and were
soon making fair headway. Percy eyed them sulkily.

His pricked fingers smarted. The boat rolled and pitched on the old
swell, making him a trifle seasick. A wave of disgust swept over him.
This was no place for the son of a millionaire. He wished himself
back on the land.

By the time they reached Tarpaulin, at about half past four, all the
six trawls were baited.

"We won't set them till day after to-morrow," determined Jim. "Guess we
can find enough work to keep us busy ashore till then."
There was no doubt about that. Until supper-time various odd jobs
kept everybody occupied. Most important of all, the mosquito netting
was cut and tacked over the three windows.

"Now we can have plenty of fresh air with the mosquitoes strained out of
it," said Jim.

Boughs of spruce and fir were brought from the woods and strewn in the
bunks under the blankets. That night the boys turned in early and
slept like the dead. Even Percy could find little fault with his pillow
and mattress of fragrant needles.

In the morning he took a swim. The water was too cold for comfort, and
inadvertently he ran into a school of jellyfish, from which he emerged
feeling as if he were on fire all over. He dressed hurriedly, shivering
and disgruntled. The novelty of Tarpaulin was wearing off, and he
hoped heartily that he would soon be in a more interesting place.
A month there would drag horribly.

That forenoon the inside of the cabin was put to rights. The spring was
cleaned out and stoned up. Under Jim's direction the boys gathered a
heap of driftwood and dragged it up to the highest part of Brimstone
Point. There a beacon was built, and kindling placed beneath it.

"That'll serve as a lighthouse in case any of us get caught out at night
and lose our way," said Jim.

The remainder of the morning was spent in fitting up the lobster-traps
with warps, toggles, and buoys.

During dinner the summer's work was discussed and the boys were allotted
their respective duties. To Jim fell naturally the oversight of
the fishing and lobstering. Lane was to receive and disburse all moneys,
and have general charge of the business matters of the concern.
Throppy, because of his mechanical and inventive turn of mind, was
intrusted with the duty of seeing that the cabin, the boats, and
all the gear were kept in first-class shape.
"Now," concluded Jim, "so far the most important position of all
has gone begging. Who'll be cook? Whittington, it lies between you
and Filippo."
"You can strike my name from the ballot at the go-off," stated
Percy, promptly. "I never even boiled an egg in my life, and I don't
intend to begin now." 
[Illustration]
"That narrows it down to Filippo," said Jim. "What do you say? Will
you cook for us?"
The Italian's melancholy olive face lighted up with pleasure.
"_Si, si!_" he exclaimed, gladly. "I will cook."
"Good enough! You're elected, then! We'll all tell you everything
we know. Here's an old cook-book on the shelf, and well teach you
the recipes. That leaves Whittington for general-utility man. He'll
be our hewer of wood and drawer of water, to say nothing of washing
the dishes.
We'll all feel free to call on him whenever any of us gets into a
tight place. How does that hit you, Whittington?"
"Never touched me! I'm no servant."
"What will you do, then?" inquired Jim, pointedly.
"Just what I please, and not a thing besides," replied Percy, with
equal directness.
The others exchanged looks, but Jim said no more.
The greater part of the afternoon was devoted to setting the
lobster-traps. They were loaded on the sloop, dory, and pea-pod,
taken out, and dropped overboard around the island, brown bottles,
of which there was a generous supply in the shed, being fastened
to the warps for "toggles," to hold them off the bottom, so that
they might not catch on the rocks. By five all the traps were
set.
"You and Throppy can pull these to-morrow morning, Budge," said
Jim, and he gave them brief directions. "I'll make a trip with you
myself the next day. But to-morrow Whittington and I are going to
see what we can get on the trawl."
After an early supper they climbed the eastern point. The sheep,
which were feeding on its top, scampered off at their approach,
their retreat covered by the ram, with shaking head. Nemo rushed,
barking, after the flock, only to be butted ignominiously head over
heels and to retreat, yelping, to the beach.
"Bully for Aries!" laughed Throppy.

"Who's Aries?" asked Percy.
"The ram, of course! Where's your Latin?"
"Never heard the word. Where do these sheep drink, anyway? Out of
the spring?"
"No," replied Jim. "The dew on the grass gives them all the moisture
they need."
Sandpeeps were teetering along the ledges below. Two seals bobbed
their round, black heads in the surf at the promontory's foot. A
mile to the south rose the spout of a whale.
"Many craft go by here?" inquired Budge.
"Plenty. Fishing-schooners, tugs with their tows, yachts, tramp
steamers, sailing-vessels from the Bay of Fundy for Boston, and
every little while a smack or power-boat. The ocean liners to
Portland pass about fifteen miles south. So we oughtn't to be
lonesome."
On the highest part of the point Throppy found a dead spruce about
twenty feet tall, which he picked as a mast for his wireless. Its
top would be at least sixty feet above the cabin, so he could talk
over twenty-five miles. He had brought with him four hundred feet
of copper bell-wire and a dozen or so cleat insulators. He cut two
spruce spreaders, and strung his antennæ. Then he made a hole through
the cabin wall, improvised an insulator out of a broken bottle, and
a rough table out of a spare box, and was ready to install his
batteries and instruments as soon as they should arrive.
The boys returned to the cabin.
"How about those conditions, Whittington?" asked Budge. "Going to
begin making 'em up?"
"No hurry about that," responded Percy, indifferently.
He went outside to smoke a cigarette. The bull-frogs were singing
in the marsh. Inside, Roger was making a start on teaching Filippo
English, and learning a little Italian in return. Throppy was tuning
his violin.
He played a short selection, and then the boys turned in.
"To-morrow we start fishing in dead earnest," said Jim. "Whittington
and I'll get up at midnight, and Filippo'll have to give us breakfast.
You other fellows won't need to turn out till four. Here's hoping
for good luck all round!"
Percy made a wry face. The hour for rising did not sound good to
him, but there was no harm in trying it once. After that he would
see. Soon all were sound asleep, lulled by the murmur of the
surf.

VI 
TRAWLING FOR HAKE
"Turn out, Whittington! All aboard for the fishing-grounds!"

Spurling's voice, reinforcing the last echoes of the alarm-clock,
dispelled Percy's inclination to roll over for another nap. Jim's
strong tones carried a suggestion of authority which the younger
lad was half minded to resent. He swallowed his pride, however,
rolled out, and dressed. It was only a half-hour after midnight
when he sat down with Jim to a breakfast of warmed-over beans,
corn-bread, and coffee, prepared by Filippo.But perhaps the day
approaches when posterity will offer an expiation for this great
ecclesiastical crime, and a statue of Bruno be unveiled under the dome
of St. Peter's at Rome.


CHAPTER VII.

     CONTROVERSY RESPECTING THE AGE OF THE EARTH.

     Scriptural view that the Earth is only six thousand years
     old, and that it was made in a week.--Patristic chronology
     founded on the ages of the patriarchs.--Difficulties arising
     from different estimates in different versions of the Bible.

     Legend of the Deluge.--The repeopling.--The Tower of Babel;
     the confusion of tongues.--The primitive language.

     Discovery by Cassini of the oblateness of the planet
     Jupiter.--Discovery by Newton of the oblateness of the
     Earth.--Deduction that she has been modeled by mechanical
     causes.--Confirmation of this by geological discoveries
     respecting aqueous rocks; corroboration by organic remains.--
     The necessity of admitting enormously long periods of
     time.--Displacement of the doctrine of Creation by that of
     Evolution--Discoveries respecting the Antiquity of Man.

     The time-scale and space-scale of the world are infinite.--
     Moderation with which the discussion of the Age of the World
     has been conducted.


THE true position of the earth in the universe was established only
after a long and severe conflict. The Church used whatever power she
had, even to the infliction of death, for sustaining her ideas. But
it was in vain. The evidence in behalf of the Copernican theory became
irresistible. It was at length universally admitted that the sun is the
central, the ruling body of our system; the earth only one, and by no
means the largest, of a family of encircling planets. Taught by the
issue of that dispute, when the question of the age of the world
presented itself for consideration, the Church did not exhibit the
active resistance she had displayed on the former occasion. For,
though her traditions were again put in jeopardy, they were not, in her
judgment, so vitally assailed. To dethrone the Earth from her dominating
position was, so the spiritual authorities declared, to undermine the
very foundation of revealed truth; but discussions respecting the date
of creation might within certain limits be permitted. Those limits were,
however, very quickly overpassed, and thus the controversy became as
dangerous as the former one had been.

It was not possible to adopt the advice given by Plato in his "Timaeus,"
when treating of this subject--the origin of the universe: "It is proper
that both I who speak and you who judge should remember that we are but
men, and therefore, receiving the probable mythological tradition, it
is meet that we inquire no further into it." Since the time of St.
Augustine the Scriptures had been made the great and final authority in
all matters of science, and theologians had deduced from them schemes of
chronology and cosmogony which had proved to be stumbling-blocks to the
advance of real knowledge.

It is not necessary for us to do more than to allude to some of the
leading features of these schemes; their peculiarities will be easily
discerned with sufficient clearness. Thus, from the six days of creation
and the Sabbath-day of rest, since we are told that a day is with the
Lord as a thousand years, it was inferred that the duration of the
world will be through six thousand years of suffering, and an additional
thousand, a millennium of rest. It was generally admitted that the
earth was about four thousand years old at the birth of Christ, but, so
careless had Europe been in the study of its annals, that not Until
A.D. 627 had it a proper chronology of its own. A Roman abbot, Dionysius
Exiguus, or Dennis the Less, then fixed the vulgar era, and gave Europe
its present Christian chronology.

The method followed in obtaining the earliest chronological dates was
by computations, mainly founded on the lives of the patriarchs. Much
difficulty was encountered in reconciling numerical discrepancies. Even
if, as was taken for granted in those uncritical ages, Moses was the
author of the books imputed to him, due weight was not given to the fact
that he related events, many of which took place more than two thousand
years before he was born. It scarcely seemed necessary to regard the
Pentateuch as of plenary inspiration, since no means had been provided
to perpetuate its correctness. The different copies which had escaped
the chances of time varied very much; thus the Samaritan made thirteen
hundred and seven years from the Creation to the Deluge, the Hebrew
sixteen hundred and fifty-six, the Septuagint twenty-two hundred and
sixty-three. The Septuagint counted fifteen hundred years more from the
Creation to Abraham than the Hebrew. In general, however, there was
an inclination to the supposition that the Deluge took place about two
thousand years after the Creation, and, after another interval of two
thousand years, Christ was born. Persons who had given much attention
to the subject affirmed that there were not less than one hundred
and thirty-two different opinions as to the year in which the Messiah
appeared, and hence they declared that it was inexpedient to press for
acceptance the Scriptural numbers too closely, since it was plain,
from the great differences in different copies, that there had been no
providential intervention to perpetuate a correct reading, nor was there
any mark by which men could be guided to the only authentic version.
Even those held in the highest esteem contained undeniable errors. Thus
the Septuagint made Methuselah live until after the Deluge.

It was thought that, in the antediluvian world, the year consisted
of three hundred and sixty days. Some even affirmed that this was
the origin of the division of the circle into three hundred and sixty
degrees. At the time of the Deluge, so many theologians declared, the
motion of the sun was altered, and the year became five days and six
hours longer. There was a prevalent opinion that that stupendous event
occurred on November 2d, in the year of the world 1656. Dr. Whiston,
however, disposed to greater precision, inclined to postpone it to
November 28th. Some thought that the rainbow was not seen until after
the flood; others, apparently with better reason, inferred that it was
then first established as a sign. On coming forth from the ark, men
received permission to use flesh as food, the antediluvians having been
herbivorous! It would seem that the Deluge had not occasioned any great
geographical changes, for Noah, relying on his antediluvian knowledge,
proceeded to divide the earth among his three sons, giving to Japhet
Europe, to Shem Asia, to Ham Africa. No provision was made for America,
as he did not know of its existence. These patriarchs, undeterred by the
terrible solitudes to which they were going, by the undrained swamps
and untracked forests, journeyed to their allotted possessions, and
commenced the settlement of the continents.

In seventy years the Asiatic family had increased to several hundred.
They had found their way to the plains of Mesopotamia, and there, for
some motive that we cannot divine, began building a tower "whose top
might reach to heaven." Eusebius informs us that the work continued for
forty years. They did not abandon it until a miraculous confusion of
their language took place and dispersed them all over the earth. St.
Ambrose shows that this confusion could not have been brought about by
men. Origen believes that not even the angels accomplished it.

The confusion of tongues has given rise to many curious speculations
among divines as to the primitive speech of man. Some have thought
that the language of Adam consisted altogether of nouns, that they were
monosyllables, and that the confusion was occasioned by the introduction
of polysyllables. But these learned men must surely have overlooked the
numerous conversations reported in Genesis, such as those between the
Almighty and Adam, the serpent and Eve, etc. In these all the various
parts of speech occur. There was, however, a coincidence of opinion
that the primitive language was Hebrew. On the general principles of
patristicism, it was fitting that this should be the case.

The Greek Fathers computed that, at the time of the dispersion,
seventy-two nations were formed, and in this conclusion St. Augustine
coincides. But difficulties seem to have been recognized in these
computations; thus the learned Dr. Shuckford, who has treated very
elaborately on all the foregoing points in his excellent work "On the
Sacred and Profane History of the World connected," demonstrates that
there could not have been more than twenty-one or twenty-two men, women,
and children, in each of those kingdoms.

A very vital point in this system of chronological computation, based
upon the ages of the patriarchs, was the great length of life to which
those worthies attained. It was generally supposed that before the Flood
"there was a perpetual equinox," and no vicissitudes in Nature. After
that event the standard of life diminished one-half, and in the time of
the Psalmist it had sunk to seventy years, at which it still remains.

And perhaps we may be brought to the conclusion to
which Dr. Shuckford, above quoted, was constrained to come, after his
wearisome and unavailing attempt to coordinate its various parts: "As to
the Fathers of the first ages of the Church, they were good men, but not
men of universal learning."

Sacred cosmogony regards the formation and modeling of the earth as the
direct act of God; it rejects the intervention of secondary causes in
those events.

Scientific cosmogony dates from the telescopic discovery made by
Cassini--an Italian astronomer, under whose care Louis XIV. placed the
Observatory of Paris--that the planet Jupiter is not a sphere, but
an oblate spheroid, flattened at the poles. Mechanical philosophy
demonstrated that such a figure is the necessary result of the rotation
of a yielding mass, and that the more rapid the rotation the greater the
flattening, or, what comes to the same thing, the greater the equatorial
bulging must be.

From considerations--purely of a mechanical kind--Newton had foreseen
that such likewise, though to a less striking extent, must be the figure
of the earth. To the protuberant mass is due the precession of the
equinoxes, which requires twenty-five thousand eight hundred and
sixty-eight years for its completion, and also the nutation of the
earth's axis, discovered by Bradley. We have already had occasion to
remark that the earth's equatorial diameter exceeds the polar by about
twenty-six miles.

Two facts are revealed by the oblateness of the earth: 1. That she has
formerly been in a yielding or plastic condition; 2. That she has been
modeled by a mechanical and therefore a secondary cause.

But this influence of mechanical causes is manifested not only in
the exterior configuration of the globe of the earth as a spheroid of
revolution, it also plainly appears on an examination of the arrangement
of her substance.

If we consider the aqueous rocks, their aggregate is many miles in
thickness; yet they undeniably have been of slow deposit. The material
of which they consist has been obtained by the disintegration of ancient
lands; it has found its way into the water-courses, and by them been
distributed anew. Effects of this kind, taking place before our eyes,
require a very considerable lapse of time to produce a well-marked
result--a water deposit may in this manner measure in thickness a few
inches in a century--what, then, shall we say as to the time consumed in
the formation of deposits of many thousand yards?

The position of the coast-line of Egypt has been known for much more
than two thousand years. In that time it has made, by reason of the
detritus brought down by the Nile, a distinctly-marked encroachment on
the Mediterranean. But all Lower Egypt has had a similar origin. The
coast-line near the mouth of the Mississippi has been well known
for three hundred years, and during that time has scarcely made a
perceptible advance on the Gulf of Mexico; but there was a time when the
delta of that river was at St. Louis, more than seven hundred miles
from its present position. In Egypt and in America--in fact, in all
countries--the rivers have been inch by inch prolonging the land into
the sea; the slowness of their work and the vastness of its extent
satisfy us that we must concede for the operation enormous periods of
time.

To the same conclusion we are brought if we consider the filling of
lakes, the deposit of travertines, the denudation of hills, the
cutting action of the sea on its shores, the undermining of cliffs, the
weathering of rocks by atmospheric water and carbonic acid.

Sedimentary strata must have been originally deposited in planes nearly
horizontal. Vast numbers of them have been forced, either by paroxysms
at intervals or by gradual movement, into all manner of angular
inclinations. Whatever explanations we may offer of these innumerable
and immense tilts and fractures, they would seem to demand for their
completion an inconceivable length of time.

The coal-bearing strata in Wales, by their gradual submergence, have
attained a thickness of 12,000 feet; in Nova Scotia of 14,570 feet.
So slow and so steady was this submergence, that erect trees stand one
above another on successive levels; seventeen such repetitions may be
counted in a thickness of 4,515 feet. The age of the trees is proved
by their size, some being four feet in diameter. Round them, as they
gradually went down with the subsiding soil, calamites grew, at one
level after another. In the Sydney coal-field fifty-nine fossil forests
occur in superposition.

Marine shells, found on mountain-tops far in the interior of continents,
were regarded by theological writers as an indisputable illustration of
the Deluge. But when, as geological studies became more exact, it was
proved that in the crust of the earth vast fresh-water formations are
repeatedly intercalated with vast marine ones, like the leaves of a
book, it became evident that no single cataclysm was sufficient
to account for such results; that the same region, through gradual
variations of its level and changes in its topographical surroundings,
had sometimes been dry land, sometimes covered with fresh and sometimes
with sea water. It became evident also that, for the completion of these
changes, tens of thousands of years were required.

To this evidence of a remote origin of the earth, derived from the vast
superficial extent, the enormous thickness, and the varied characters of
its strata, was added an imposing body of proof depending on its fossil
remains. The relative ages of formations having been ascertained, it
was shown that there has been an advancing physiological progression of
organic forms, both vegetable and animal, from the oldest to the most
recent; that those which inhabit the surface in our times are but an
insignificant fraction of the prodigious multitude that have inhabited
it heretofore; that for each species now living there are thousands
that have become extinct. Though special formations are so strikingly
characterized by some predominating type of life as to justify such
expressions as the age of mollusks, the age of reptiles, the age of
mammals, the introduction of the new-comers did not take place abruptly.
as by sudden creation. They gradually emerged in an antecedent age,
reached their culmination in the one which they characterize, and then
gradually died out in a succeeding. There is no such thing as a
sudden creation, a sudden strange appearance--but there is a slow
metamorphosis, a slow development from a preexisting form. Here again
we encounter the necessity of admitting for such results long periods
of time. Within the range of history no well-marked instance of such
development has been witnessed, and we speak with hesitation of doubtful
instances of extinction. Yet in geological times myriads of evolutions
and extinctions have occurred.

Since thus, within the experience of man, no case of metamorphosis
or development has been observed, some have been disposed to deny its
possibility altogether, affirming that all the different species have
come into existence by separate creative acts. But surely it is less
unphilosophical to suppose that each species has been evolved from a
predecessor by a modification of its parts, than that it has suddenly
started into existence out of nothing. Nor is there much weight in
the remark that no man has ever witnessed such a transformation taking
place. Let it be remembered that no man has ever witnessed an act
of creation, the sudden appearance of an organic form, without any
progenitor.

Abrupt, arbitrary, disconnected creative acts may serve to illustrate
the Divine power; but that continuous unbroken chain of organisms which
extends from palaeozoic formations to the formations of recent times, a
chain in which each link hangs on a preceding and sustains a succeeding
one, demonstrates to us not only that the production of animated beings
is governed by law, but that it is by law that has undergone no change.
In its operation, through myriads of ages, there has been no variation,
no suspension.

The foregoing paragraphs may serve to indicate the character of a
portion of the evidence with which we must deal in considering the
problem of the age of the earth. Through the unintermitting labors of
geologists, so immense a mass has been accumulated, that many volumes
would be required to contain the details. It is drawn from the phenomena
presented by all kinds of rocks, aqueous, igneous, metamorphic.

Oliver!"
To withstand this flood of impiety, the papal government established two
institutions: 1. The Inquisition; 2. Auricular confession--the latter as
a means of detection, the former as a tribunal for punishment.

In general terms, the commission of the Inquisition was, to extirpate
religious dissent by terrorism, and surround heresy with the most
horrible associations; this necessarily implied the power of determining
what constitutes heresy. The criterion of truth was thus in possession
of this tribunal, which was charged "to discover and bring to judgment
heretics lurking in towns, houses, cellars, woods, caves, and fields."
With such savage alacrity did it carry out its object of protecting the
interests of religion, that between 1481 and 1808 it had punished three
hundred and forty thousand persons, and of these nearly thirty-two
thousand had been burnt! In its earlier days, when public opinion could
find no means of protesting against its atrocities, "it often put to
death, without appeal, on the very day that they were accused, nobles,
clerks, monks, hermits, and lay persons of every rank." In whatever
direction thoughtful men looked, the air was full of fearful shadows. No
one could indulge in freedom of thought without expecting punishment. So
dreadful were the proceedings of the Inquisition, that the exclamation
of Pagliarici was the exclamation of thousands: "It is hardly possible
for a man to be a Christian, and die in his bed."

The Inquisition destroyed the sectaries of Southern France in the
thirteenth century. Its unscrupulous atrocities extirpated Protestantism
in Italy and Spain. Nor did it confine itself to religious affairs; it
engaged in the suppression of political discontent. Nicolas Eymeric, who
was inquisitor-general of the kingdom of Aragon for nearly fifty years,
and who died in 1399, has left a frightful statement of its conduct and
appalling cruelties in his "Directorium Inquisitorum."

This disgrace of Christianity, and indeed of the human race, had
different constitutions in different countries. The papal Inquisition
continued the tyranny, and eventually superseded the old episcopal
inquisitions. The authority of the bishops was unceremoniously put aside
by the officers of the pope.

By the action of the fourth Lateran Council, A.D. 1215, the power of
the Inquisition was frightfully increased, the necessity of private
confession to a priest--auricular confession--being at that time
formally established. This, so far as domestic life was concerned, gave
omnipresence and omniscience to the Inquisition. Not a man was safe.
In the hands of the priest, who, at the confessional, could extract or
extort from them their most secret thoughts, his wife and his servants
were turned into spies. Summoned before the dread tribunal, he was
simply informed that he lay under strong suspicions of heresy. 
Whittington in him was coming out. Everybody else was in camp when he
stepped inside. these mysterious trips, but failed to extract any information
from him regarding them.

awaited the verdict, looking eagerly from one to the other. There was a

noon the boys related their narrow escape to the others, and all
agreed it would be well to keep a sharp lookout for Brittler and his
gang." They've got a grudge against us, fast enough," said Lane." They
intend to even matters up if they can find the chance." That afternoon
Percy wielded the splitting-knife." You'll soon get the knack of it,"
approved Jim." Do n't pitch in too hard at first. Later, soft on, after

As we have seen in former chapters, an antagonism between religion and
science had existed from the earliest days of Christianity. On every
occasion permitting its display it may be detected through successive
centuries. We witness it in the downfall of the Alexandrian Museum, in
the cases of Erigena and Wiclif, in the contemptuous rejection by the
heretics of the thirteenth century of the Scriptural account of the
Creation; but it was not until the epoch of Copernicus, Kepler, and
Galileo, that the efforts of Science to burst from the thraldom in which
she was fettered became uncontrollable. In all countries the political
power of the Church had greatly declined; her leading men perceived
that the cloudy foundation on which she had stood was dissolving away.
Repressive measures against her antagonists, in old times resorted
to with effect, could be no longer advantageously employed. To her
interests the burning of a philosopher here and there did more harm than
good. In her great conflict with astronomy, a conflict in which Galileo
stands as the central figure, she received an utter overthrow; and, as
we have seen, when the immortal work of Newton was printed, she could
offer no resistance, though Leibnitz affirmed, in the face of Europe,
that "Newton had robbed the Deity of some of his most excellent
attributes, and had sapped the foundation of natural religion."

From the time of Newton to our own time, the divergence of science from
the dogmas of the Church has continually increased. The Church declared
that the earth is the central and most important body in the universe;
that the sun and moon and stars are tributary to it. On these points
she was worsted by astronomy. She affirmed that a universal deluge had
covered the earth; that the only surviving animals were such as had
been saved in an ark. In this her error was established by geology. She
taught that there was a first man, who, some six or eight thousand years
ago, was suddenly created or called into existence in a condition of
physical and moral perfection, and from that condition he fell. But
anthropology has shown that human beings existed far back in geological
time, and in a savage state but little better than that of the brute.

Many good and well-meaning men have attempted to reconcile the
statements of Genesis with the discoveries of science, but it is in
vain. The divergence has increased so much, that it has become an
absolute opposition. One of the antagonists must give way.

May we not, then, be permitted to examine the authenticity of this book,
which, since the second century, has been put forth as the criterion of
scientific truth? To maintain itself in a position so exalted, it must
challenge human criticism.

In the early Christian ages, many of the most eminent Fathers of the
Church had serious doubts respecting the authorship of the entire
Pentateuch. I have not space, in the limited compass of these pages, to
present in detail the facts and arguments that were then and have since
been adduced. The literature of the subject is now very extensive. I
may, however, refer the reader to the work of the pious and learned Dean
Prideaux, on "The Old and New Testament connected," a work which is one
of the literary ornaments of the last century. He will also find the
subject more recently and exhaustively discussed by Bishop Colenso. The
following paragraphs will convey a sufficiently distinct impression of
the present state of the controversy:

The Pentateuch is affirmed to have been written by Moses, under the
influence of divine inspiration. Considered thus, as a record vouchsafed
and dictated by the Almighty, it commands not only scientific but
universal consent.

But here, in the first place, it may be demanded, Who or what is it that
has put forth this great claim in its behalf?

Not the work itself. It nowhere claims the authorship of one man, or
makes the impious declaration that it is the writing of Almighty God.

Not until after the second century was there any such extravagant
demand on human credulity. It originated, not among the higher ranks of
Christian philosophers, but among the more fervid Fathers of the Church,
whose own writings prove them to have been unlearned and uncritical
persons.

Every age, from the second century to our times, has offered men of
great ability, both Christian and Jewish, who have altogether repudiated
these claims. Their decision has been founded upon the intrinsic
evidence of the books themselves. These furnish plain indications of at
least two distinct authors, who have been respectively termed Elohistic
and Jehovistic. Hupfeld maintains that the Jehovistic narrative bears
marks of having been a second original record, wholly independent of the
Elohistic. The two sources from which the narratives have been derived
are, in many respects, contradictory of each other. Moreover, it is
asserted that the books of the Pentateuch are never ascribed to Moses
in the inscriptions of Hebrew manuscripts, or in printed copies of the
Hebrew Bible, nor are they styled "Books of Moses" in the Septuagint or
Vulgate, but only in modern translations.

It is clear that they cannot be imputed to the sole authorship of Moses,
since they record his death. It is clear that they were not written
until many hundred years after that event, since they contain references
to facts which did not occur until after the establishment of the
government of kings among the Jews.

No man may dare to impute them to the inspiration of Almighty God--their
inconsistencies, incongruities, contradictions, and impossibilities, as
exposed by many learned and pious moderns, both German and English,
are so great. It is the decision of these critics that Genesis is a
narrative based upon legends; that Exodus is not historically true; that
the whole Pentateuch is unhistoric and non-Mosaic; it contains the most
extraordinary contradictions and impossibilities, sufficient to involve
the credibility of the whole--imperfections so many and so conspicuous
that they would destroy the authenticity of any modern historical work.

Hengstenberg, in his "Dissertations on the Genuineness of the
Pentateuch," says: "It is the unavoidable fate of a spurious historical
work of any length to be involved in contradictions. This must be the
case to a very great extent with the Pentateuch, if it be not genuine.
If the Pentateuch is spurious, its histories and laws have been
fabricated in successive portions, and were committed to writing in the
course of many centuries by different individuals. From such a mode of
origination, a mass of contradictions is inseparable, and the improving
hand of a later editor could never be capable of entirely obliterating
them."

To the above conclusions I may add that we are expressly told by Ezra
(Esdras ii. 14) that he himself, aided by five other persons, wrote
these books in the space of forty days. He says that at the time of the
Babylonian captivity the ancient sacred writings of the Jews were burnt,
and gives a particular detail of the circumstances under which these
were composed. He sets forth that he undertook to write all that had
been done in the world since the beginning. It may be said that the
books of Esdras are apocryphal, but in return it may be demanded, Has
that conclusion been reached on evidence that will withstand modern
criticism? In the early ages of Christianity, when the story of the fall
of man was not considered as essential to the Christian system, and the
doctrine of the atonement had not attained that precision which Anselm
eventually gave it, it was very generally admitted by the Fathers of the
Church that Ezra probably did so compose the Pentateuch. Thus St. Jerome
says, "Sive Mosem dicere volueris auctorem Pentateuchi, sive Esdram
ejusdem instauratorem operis, non recuso." Clemens Alexandrinus
says that when these books had been destroyed in the captivity of
Nebuchadnezzar, Esdras, having become inspired prophetically, reproduced
them. Irenaeus says the same.

The incidents contained in Genesis, from the first to the tenth chapters
inclusive (chapters which, in their bearing upon science, are of more
importance than other portions of the Pentateuch), have been obviously
compiled from short, fragmentary legends of various authorship. To the
critical eye they all, however, present peculiarities which demonstrate
that they were written on the banks of the Euphrates, and not in the
Desert of Arabia. They contain many Chaldaisms. An Egyptian would not
speak of the Mediterranean Sea as being west of him, an Assyrian would.
Their scenery and machinery, if such expressions may with propriety be
used, are altogether Assyrian, not Egyptian. They were such records as
one might expect to meet with in the cuneiform impressions of the
tile libraries of the Mesopotamian kings. It is affirmed that one such
legend, that of the Deluge, has already been exhumed, and it is not
beyond the bounds of probability that the remainder may in like manner
be obtained.

From such Assyrian sources, the legends of the creation of the earth and
heaven, the garden of Eden, the making of man from clay, and of woman
from one of his ribs, the temptation by the serpent, the naming of
animals, the cherubim and flaming sword, the Deluge and the ark, the
drying up of the waters by the wind, the building of the Tower of
Babel, and the confusion of tongues, were obtained by Ezra. He commences
abruptly the proper history of the Jews in the eleventh chapter. At that
point his universal history ceases; he occupies himself with the story
of one family, the descendants of Shem.

It is of this restriction that the Duke of Argyll, in his book on
"Primeval Man," very graphically says:

In the genealogy of the family of Shem we have a list of names which are
names, and nothing more to us. It is a genealogy which neither does, nor
pretends to do, more than to trace the order of succession among a few
families only, out of the millions then already existing in the world.
Nothing but this order of succession is given, nor is it at all certain
that this order is consecutive or complete. Nothing is told us of all
that lay behind that curtain of thick darkness, in front of which
these names are made to pass; and yet there are, as it were, momentary
liftings, through which we have glimpses of great movements which were
going on, and had been long going on beyond. No shapes are distinctly
seen. Even the direction of those movements can only be guessed. But
voices are heard which are "as the voices of many waters." I agree in
the opinion of Hupfeld, that "the discovery that the Pentateuch is put
together out of various sources, or original documents, is beyond
all doubt not only one of the most important and most pregnant with
consequences for the interpretation of the historical books of the Old
Testament, or rather for the whole of theology and history, but it is
also one of the most certain discoveries which have been made in
the domain of criticism and the history of literature. Whatever the
anticritical party may bring forward to the contrary, it will maintain
itself, and not retrograde again through any thing, so long as there
exists such a thing as criticism; and it will not be easy for a reader
upon the stage of culture on which we stand in the present day, if he
goes to the examination unprejudiced, and with an uncorrupted power of
appreciating the truth, to be able to ward off its influence."

What then? shall we give up these books? Does not the admission that the
narrative of the fall in Eden is legendary carry with it the surrender
of that most solemn and sacred of Christian doctrines, the atonement?

Let us reflect on this! Christianity, in its earliest days, when it was
converting and conquering the world, knew little or nothing about that
doctrine. We have seen that, in his "Apology," Tertullian did not
think it worth his while to mention it. It originated among the Gnostic
heretics. It was not admitted by the Alexandrian theological school. It
was never prominently advanced by the Fathers. It was not brought into
its present commanding position until the time of Anselm Philo Judaeus
speaks of the story of the fall as symbolical; Origen regarded it as an
allegory. Perhaps some of the Protestant churches may, with reason, be
accused of inconsistency, since in part they consider it as mythical, in
part real. But, if, with them, we admit that the serpent is symbolical
of Satan, does not that cast an air of allegory over the whole
narrative?

It is to be regretted that the Christian Church has burdened itself with
the defense of these books, and voluntarily made itself answerable for
their manifest contradictions and errors. Their vindication, if it
were possible, should have been resigned to the Jews, among whom they
originated, and by whom they have been transmitted to us. Still more, it
is to be deeply regretted that the Pentateuch, a production so imperfect
as to be unable to stand the touch of modern criticism, should be put
forth as the arbiter of science. Let it be remembered that the exposure
of the true character of these books has been made, not by captious
enemies, but by pious and learned churchmen, some of them of the highest
dignity.

While thus the Protestant churches have insisted on the acknowledgment
of the Scriptures as the criterion of truth, the Catholic has, in our
own times, declared the infallibility of the pope. It may be said that
this infallibility applies only to moral or religious things; but where
shall the line of separation be drawn? Onmiscience cannot be limited
to a restricted group of questions; in its very nature it implies the
knowledge of all, and infallibility means omniscience.

Doubtless, if the fundamental principles of Italian Christianity be
admitted, their logical issue is an infallible pope. There is no need to
dwell on the unphilosophical nature of this conception; it is destroyed
by an examination of the political history of the papacy, and the
biography of the popes. The former exhibits all the errors and mistakes
to which institutions of a confessedly human character have been found
liable; the latter is only ton frequently a story of sin and shame.

It was not possible that the authoritative promulgation of the dogma of
papal infallibility should meet among enlightened Catholics universal
acceptance. Serious and wide-spread dissent has been produced. A
doctrine so revolting to common-sense could not find any other result.
There are many who affirm that, if infallibility exists anywhere, it is
in oecumenical councils, and yet such councils have not always agreed
with each other. There are also many who remember that councils
have deposed popes, and have passed judgment on their clamors and
contentions. Higgins laughed shortly." What--old Thorpe! Oh yes, I've

hard job. The gale, now far stronger than the tide that flowed against

forgotten."_Calista!_ He'll tow us in." Presently the lobster-smack
was alongside, and soon the_Calista_, with sloop to inspire confidence
in a landsman. With every sea the dory leaped back several feet crests
off the racing billows flung them over the boat in showers of spray.

Now and and then a bucketful came aboard. It kept Percy busy bailing.
Occasionally Jim brought the dory head to the wind and lay on his
oars to rest.

serious. half-barrel of water slopped aboard. You've it now!"
Wrenching the port oar from his horrified bigamist, he sprang aft, dropped
it in the notch" Tired, Jim hopeless attempt. However strong he
might be, no man with only one could make headway into the teeth of
such a gale. For a time his desperate efforts held the dory in her place.
Then little by little she began to go astern. With sinking heart Percy
watched Spurling's shoulders rack and well both were clad in oilskins I
know. Have n't met with OR BREAKER Consternation seized. Never before
had he known Jim to acknowledge himself beaten. Their plight must be
serious indeed. The dory swung side to the sea and sank into the trough.

The latter lay down flat on his back in the bottom of the dory.
Apparently he was not far from complete exhaustion." Keep her up

motions became slower and" Hi! Hi! Hulloo-oo!" he yelled." Oh, Budge! Oh,
Throppy!

a solid wall. His cries were whirled away by the gale. Presently he
became silent, realizing that he was wasting his breath. Rapidly the
dory drifted seaward. say! May be a dry blow for two days longer." He
looked eastward." What's that coming? Steamer?" Sure enough it was.
Below the white light on the masthead appeared and disappeared the

his eyes had caught the dying beacon. He said nothing; there was nothing
to say. a night and more on the water, and we want to do our best

only thing now is to try not to spill any more." The rain was descending
in torrents. Storm and night drew a narrow circle the of gloom
about reeling boat.

Spurling by this exhortation, Percy jerked at the oars savagely and
unskilfully. As he swayed back there was a sharp snap, and the
starboard oar broke squarely, just above the blade. Round swing the dory,

tossed into the stern.

with water, and drifting on its In a little while that all was

Soon they could objections be seen all the time. Percy began to grow

I'm afraid she's coming too near for comfort," said Jim, anxiously." She
might run us down and never know it.
Nay, more,
the formation of planets, the formation of satellites and of asteroids,
is accounted for. We see why the outer planets and satellites are larger
than the interior ones; why the larger planets rotate rapidly, and the
small ones slowly; why of the satellites the outer planets have more,
the inner fewer. We are furnished with indications of the time of
revolution of the planets in their orbits, and of the satellites in
theirs; we perceive the mode of formation of Saturn's rings. We find an
explanation of the physical condition of the sun, and the transitions of
condition through which the earth and moon have passed, as indicated by
their geology.

But two exceptions to the above peculiarities have been noted; they are
in the cases of Uranus and Neptune.

The existence of such a nebulous mass once admitted, all the rest
follows as a matter of necessity. Is there not, however, a most serious
objection in the way? Is not this to exclude Almighty God from the
worlds he has made?

First, we must be satisfied whether there is any solid evidence for
admitting the existence of such a nebulous mass.

The nebular hypothesis rests primarily on the telescopic discovery made
by Herschel I., that there are scattered here and there in the heavens
pale, gleaming patches of light, a few of which are large enough to be
visible to the naked eye. Of these, many may be resolved by a sufficient
telescopic power into a congeries of stars, but some, such as the great
nebula in Orion, have resisted the best instruments hitherto made.

It was asserted by those who were indisposed to accept the nebular
hypothesis, that the non-resolution was due to imperfection in the
telescopes used. In these instruments two distinct functions may be
observed: their light-gathering power depends on the diameter of their
object mirror or lens, their defining power depends on the exquisite
correctness of their optical surfaces. Grand instruments may possess
the former quality in perfection by reason of their size, but the latter
very imperfectly, either through want of original configuration, or
distortion arising from flexure through their own weight. But, unless an
instrument be perfect in this respect, as well as adequate in the other,
it may fail to decompose a nebula into discrete points.

Fortunately, however, other means for the settlement of this question
are available. In 1846, it was discovered by the author of this book
that the spectrum of an ignited solid is continuous--that is, has
neither dark nor bright lines. Fraunhofer had previously made known that
the spectrum of ignited gases is discontinuous. Here, then, is the means
of determining whether the light emitted by a given nebula comes from an
incandescent gas, or from a congeries of ignited solids, stars, or
suns. If its spectrum be discontinuous, it is a true nebula or gas; if
continuous, a congeries of stars.

In 1864, Mr. Huggins made this examination in the case of a nebula in
the constellation Draco. It proved to be gaseous.

Subsequent observations have shown that, of sixty nebulae examined,
nineteen give discontinuous or gaseous spectra--the remainder continuous
ones.

It may, therefore, be admitted that physical evidence has at length
been obtained, demonstrating the existence of vast masses of matter in a
gaseous condition, and at a temperature of incandescence. The hypothesis
of Laplace has thus a firm basis. In such a nebular mass, cooling by
radiation is a necessary incident, and condensation and rotation the
inevitable results. There must be a separation of rings all lying in
one plane, a generation of planets and satellites all rotating alike,
a central sun and engirdling globes. From a chaotic mass, through the
operation of natural laws, an organized system has been produced. An
integration of matter into worlds has taken place through a decline of
heat.

If such be the cosmogony of the solar system, such the genesis of the
planetary worlds, we are constrained to extend our views of the dominion
of law, and to recognize its agency in the creation as well as in the
conservation of the innumerable orbs that throng the universe.

But, again, it may be asked: "Is there not something profoundly impious
in this? Are we not excluding Almighty God from the world he has made?"

We have often witnessed the formation of a cloud in a serene sky. A hazy
point, barely perceptible--a little wreath of mist--increases in volume,
and becomes darker and denser, until it obscures a large portion of the
heavens. It throws itself into fantastic shapes, it gathers a glory
from the sun, is borne onward by the wind, and, perhaps, as it gradually
came, so it gradually disappears, melting away in the untroubled air.

Now, we say that the little vesicles of which this cloud was composed
arose from the condensation of water-vapor preexisting in the
atmosphere, through reduction of temperature; we show how they assumed
the form they present. We assign optical reasons for the brightness
or blackness of the cloud; we explain, on mechanical principles, its
drifting before the wind; for its disappearance we account on
the principles of chemistry. A light wind was blowing from the
north, but the sea was fairly smooth.

"Guess we'll run down to Clay Bank," said Spurling. "It's only six miles
to the southward.

We ought to get a good set there."
Steadily they plowed on. It was Percy's first experience in a small
boat on the midnight ocean, and he felt something akin to awe as
they breasted the long swells, heaving in slowly and gently, yet
resistlessly. Down to the horizon all around arched the deep blue
firmament, spangled with stars. Matinicus Rock glittered in the west,
while just beyond the shoulder of Brimstone Point, Saddleback Light,
almost level with the sea, kept vanishing and reappearing.

As the _Barracouta_ forged forward her prow started two diverging
lines of phosphorescent bubbles and her wake resembled a trail of boiling
flame. Percy called Jim's attention to the display.

"Yes," remarked the latter, "the water's firing in good shape
to-night."
There was a sudden splash to starboard. A gleaming body several feet
long rolled up above the surface; a grunting sigh broke the silence;
and the apparition disappeared.

"What's that?" demanded the startled Percy.

"Porpoise! 'Puffing pig.'"
For over an hour Jim held the sloop to an exact course by means of his
compass. At half past two he stopped the engine.

"Well, I guess we're here!"
"We're here, fast enough!" assented Percy, staring about. "But where's
here? Doesn't look any different to me from anywhere else."
"Clay Bank."
With his sounding-lead Jim tried the depth of the water.

"Thought so! Fifty fathoms!"
He prepared at once to set the trawl. Dropping the outer jib and
mainsail, he jogged slowly before the wind under the jumbo, or
inner jib.

"Now let her go!"
Over splashed the buoy, an empty pickle-keg, painted red, and drifted
astern. Next, down went the light anchor. As soon as it reached bottom
Jim lifted the first tub of trawl to the wash-board. Then with the
heaving-stick, eighteen inches long and whittled to a point, he began
to flirt overboard the coils lying in the tub.

Percy, holding the lantern, watched the steady stream of gangings and
herring-baited hooks follow one another over the side and sink
astern.
In a surprisingly short time the tub was empty, and the five hundred
fathoms of trawl, with more than a hook to a fathom, lay in a long,
straight line on the muddy bottom, three hundred feet below.

A second tub trailed after the first, its trawl being attached to the end
of the other. The four remaining tubs followed in order. At the junction
of the second and third a buoy was fastened, and another between the
fourth and fifth. To the end of the trawl from the sixth and last tub
was tied another anchor, and as soon as it had reached bottom the
last buoy was cast over.

They had set almost three and a half miles of trawl, bearing more than
thirty-one hundred short, baited lines.

"And there's a good job done!" exclaimed Jim, as the last buoy floated
astern. "Here's to a ten-pound hake on every hook!"
"Do you often catch as many as that?" inquired Percy, innocently.

Jim laughed.

"Hardly! We'll be more than lucky if we get a tenth of that number."
Day was now breaking. The night wind had died out and, save for the
long, oily swells, the sea was absolutely calm.

Jim started the engine and swung the _Barracouta_ round, and
they ran leisurely back to the other end of the trawl, meanwhile eating
the lunch Filippo had put up for them. Soon they were close to the
first red buoy.

"Now for business!" said Jim.

He stepped into the dory.

"Guess you know enough about automobiles, Whittington, to handle this
engine. Keep the sloop close by and watch me haul. You can take your
turn when I get tired."
Gaffing the buoy aboard, he pulled up the anchor, and soon was
hauling in the trawl over the wooden roller on the starboard bow.

Percy watched with all his eyes. This was real fishing.

As the line came in Jim coiled it smoothly down into an empty tub on a
stand in the bow. The first three hooks were skinned clean.

"Something down there, at any rate," he commented.

The trawl sagged heavily.

"First fish, and a good-sized one!

Pretty logy, though! Feels like a hake!"
Percy stared down into the blackish-green water. Out of its gloomy depths
rose an indistinct shadow, gradually assuming definite shape. A blunt,
lumpy head with big, staring eyes broke the surface; two long streamers
hung from beneath the lower jaw.

Jim reached for his gaff.

"Hake! And a good one, too!"
Striking the sharp iron hook through the fish's gills, he lifted
the slimy gray body over the gunwale, unhooked it, and slung it,
floundering, over the kid-board into the empty space amidships.

"Fifteen-pounder! Wish we could get a hundred more like him!
Hullo!
Who's next?"

The newcomer had a huge reddish-brown head with bulging cheeks; his
blotched body, adorned with wicked spines, tapered slimly off to an
inconspicuous tail.

"Horn-pout! Toad sculpin! Bah! Get out!"
Jim slat the fish disgustedly off, and he sculled slowly downward.

Two more bare hooks. Then three hake in succession, the largest not
over five pounds.

On the next line hung a writhing, twisting shape about eighteen inches
long. With a wry face Jim held the thing up for Percy's inspection.

"Slime eel! He's tied the ganging into knots and thrown off his
jacket.
Look here!"
He stripped from the line a handful of tough, stringy slime like
a mass of soft soap.

"How's that for an overcoat! They always throw it off when they get hung
up on a trawl."
Flinging the stuff away with a grimace, he rinsed his hand and cut off
the ganging with his knife.

"No use trying to unhook that fellow!"
Fathom after fathom of trawl came in over the roller.

The flapping, dying heap in the center of the dory enlarged steadily.
Jim was spattered with scales from head to foot, and drenched with
water from the splashing tails. He stopped for a moment to
rest.

[Illustration] 
"Now you see what oil-clothes are good for," said he.

"I'll give you your chance in a little while."
Percy had kept the _Barracouta_ near by as Jim pulled the dory along
the trawl. He could watch the process very well from the sloop, and he
was by no means anxious for a personal experience with it. It
looked too much like hard work. He made no reply to Jim's offer.

Refreshed by his rest, the latter resumed hauling. Up came a little cluster
of yellow plums, as large as small walnuts, each on a stem six
inches long, attached to a brownish bunch of roots.

"Nigger-heads! Always grow on rocky bottom; nicest kind of place for
fish. Trawl must have run over a patch of ledge. We're likely to pick
up something here besides hake. What's this?"
A heavy fish appeared, hanging motionless on the next ganging. Jim gave
a shout.

"Haddock! Twelve-pounder. Swallowed the hook and worried himself to
death. Drowned!"
"Drown a fish!" jeered Percy.

"Sure you can, any kind of fish, if you only keep his mouth open. If
this fellow hadn't taken the bait in so deep he'd have been liable
to break away. Fishermen call 'em 'butter-mouths,' their flesh is so
tender; under jaw's the only place where a hook will hold to lift 'em
by. See his red lips, and that black streak down each side. And look at
these two black spots, big as silver dollars, on his shoulders; that's
where they say the devil got him between his thumb and forefinger, but
couldn't hold on."
It was now not far from four o'clock.

The sun, rising straight from the water, lifted his fiery red disk
above the eastern horizon. It was a strange sight to Percy. The sunrises
he had seen could almost be numbered on the fingers of one hand.

He yawned. The novelty of trawling was wearing off; he wished himself
back in his hard bunk.

A heavy, chunky fish of an old-gold color, with an almost continuous
line of fins, was the next habitant of the sea to cross the dory
gunwale. Jim held him up to show Percy.

"Look at this cusk!

He likes rocky bottom as well as a haddock. He's used to deep water, and
if you start him up quick his stomach will blow out of his mouth like
a bladder.

I've seen 'em so plenty that they floated a trawl on top of water for
half a mile."
Seven or eight small haddock and cusk, and then once more the trawl began
to yield hake.

"Back again on muddy bottom," said Jim. "What d'you say to trying
your hand at it?"
Percy agreed, but without enthusiasm. He had seen enough to realize that
pulling a trawl was no sinecure. By means of a fish-fork Jim pitched
his catch aboard the sloop. The first tub of trawl was now full. He
transferred it to the _Barracouta_ and set an empty tub in its
place.

"You'll find fishing is no bed of roses," he remarked as he dropped down
into the standing-room.

"I believe you," answered Percy, with conviction.

He started to get aboard the dory.

"Not there!" warned Jim. "Forward of the kid-board!"
The caution came too late. Percy stepped into the slippery pen from
which the fish had just been pitched; unluckily, too, he was not
careful to plant his weight amidships. The dory, overbalanced to
starboard, careened suddenly, and he fell sprawling on the slimy bottom.
Jim could not repress an exclamation of impatience.

"Why didn't you step where I told you?"
"I didn't think she'd tip so easy," retorted Percy, angrily.

In bad humor with himself and things in general, he scrambled up and took
his place back of the empty tub. Jim sheered the _Barracouta_ off.

"Put on your nippers! If you don't your hands will be raw in a
little while."

Percy thrust his fingers through the white woolen doughnuts, grasped
the trawl, and began dragging it in over the roller. He made slow, awkward
work of it. Jim watched him with ill-suppressed impatience, keeping up
a constant stream of necessary counsel.

"Careful! Don't jerk so, or you'll catch your hooks in the gunwale.
There's a good-sized one!

Don't try to lift him aboard without the gaff.
Press your hook down and back! Don't yank it sideways like that; you'll
only hook him harder. Coil that line away more evenly, or we'll
have a bad mess when we come to bait up. Don't lose that fellow! There
he goes!
Be more careful of the next one!"
Needful though it was, this quickfire of advice rasped on Percy's temper.
The unaccustomed work tired him badly.

He was soon conscious of a pain in his shoulders and across the back of
his neck; his wrists ached. Every now and then the hard, wiry line slipped
off the nippers and sawed across his smarting fingers or palms. But
pride kept him doggedly pulling.

A dozen hake of various sizes lay behind him in the pen when a flat,
kite-shaped fish, four feet long, with a caricature of a human face
beneath its head, came scaling up through the water.

"What's that?" he gasped in amazement.

"Skate!"

"Shall I keep him?"
"Keep him? No! Unless you want to eat him yourself."
Bunglingly Percy tried to dismiss his unwelcome catch, but he made
slow work of extricating the deeply swallowed hook. Jim had stopped the
_Barracouta_ a few feet off. With the agony that an expert feels at
the unskilful butchery of a task by an amateur, he watched his mate's
awkward attempts. At last he could stand it no longer.

"Come aboard the sloop, Whittington," he ordered. "I'll finish
pulling the trawl."

Percy obeyed sullenly. He had almost reached his limit of physical
endurance, and he was only too glad of relief for his smarting
skin and aching muscles.

Fishing was a miserable business, and he wanted no part of it; on
that he was fully decided. But even if a job is unpleasant, a man would
rather resign than be discharged. Jim's abruptness hurt his pride;
the slight rankled.

From the _Barracouta_ he somewhat enviously watched Spurling deftly
unhook the skate. The remainder of the trawl was pulled in in silence.

Percy kept the sloop at a distance that discouraged speech, closing
the gap only when Jim signaled that he wished to discharge his cargo.
By ten o'clock the last hook was reached, anchor and buoy taken aboard,
and the _Barracouta_, with two thousand pounds of fish heaped in her
kids and towing astern in the dory, headed for Tarpaulin Island.

The trip home was a glum one. Two or three times Jim tried to
open a conversation, but Percy responded only in monosyllables.
He was tired and sleepy, and felt generally out-of-sorts. So Jim gave it
up and let him alone.

They reached Sprowl's Cove at noon. Budge and Throppy had returned some
time before from pulling the lobster-traps; Jim inspected their catch.

"About forty pounds," was his estimate. "Rather slim; but then the traps
were down only about twelve hours. We'll do better after we get fairly
started. I'm not going trawling to-morrow; so the whole crowd can make
a lobstering trip in the _Barracouta_. Now let's have dinner. This afternoon
we'll all turn to and dress fish."
Percy filed a mental negative to the last statement. He had decided that,
so far at least as Tarpaulin Island was concerned, his fishing days were
over. Nevertheless, he ate a good dinner.

At one o'clock the four academy boys rowed out to the _Barracouta_.
All but Percy had on their oilskin aprons, or "petticoats."
"Where's your regimentals, Whittington?" asked Lane.

"I'm only going to look on this afternoon," replied Percy.

The other three exchanged surprised glances, but made no comments. On board
the sloop Jim was soon busily engaged in demonstrating the process
of dressing fish. Budge and Throppy learned quickly.

Percy's refusal to take part in the work did not prevent him from
watching it with interest from the cabin roof.

The fish were split and cleaned. Their heads were cut off and thrown
into a barrel, to serve later as lobster bait, and the livers tossed
into pails. Their "sounds," the membrane running along the backbone,
were removed and placed in a box.

After the bodies had been rinsed in a tub of water, and the backbones
cut out, they were flung into the dory, taken ashore and plunged into
another tub of water, and then salted down in hogsheads. Three pairs
of hands made speedy work.

"What do you do with those?"
Percy pointed to the pails containing the livers.

"Leave 'em in a barrel in the sun to be tried out," responded Jim. "The
oil is worth more than sixty cents a gallon."
"And those?"
He indicated the box of "sounds."
"Cut 'em open with a pair of shears, press out the blood, and spread
'em on wire netting to dry for three days; then sew 'em up in sacks,
to be shipped to some glue-factory. Four pounds of 'em'll bring a
dollar.

These things and some others are the by-products of the fishing business.
They're worth too much to throw away."
Percy's eye dwelt on the knives and aprons of his three associates.

"I'm glad I don't have to fish for a living," he said.

VII

SHORTS AND COUNTERS

Percy slept soundly that night.

     To be sure, the alarm routed out the Spurlingites at the unseemly
hour of four, but that was far better than twelve.

     After breakfast he enjoyed a cigarette on the beach while the
     others were helping Filippo clear away. It was a calm,
     beautiful morning, and as young Whittington gazed over the smooth,
blue sea he felt that even a fisherman's life might have its redeeming
features.

     At six they all started to make the round of the lobster-traps,
     on the _Barracouta_. The first string of white buoys,
     striped with green, was encountered off Brimstone Point.
     
     "Here's where we make a killing," said Jim.
     
     As he approached the first buoy he opened his switch, stopping
     the engine. Putting on his woolen mittens, he picked up the
     gaff. Close under the starboard quarter bobbed the brown bottle
     that served as a toggle. Reaching out with his gaff, he
     hooked this aboard, and began hauling in the warp.

     At last the heavily weighted trap started off bottom and
     began to ascend.

     In a half-minute its end, draped with marine growths,
     broke the surface.

Holding the trap against the side, Jim tore off its incumbrances. The
trailing mass was composed principally of irregular, brownish-black,
leathery sheets at the end of long stems.

"Kelp!" answered Jim to Percy's inquiry. "Devil's aprons! They grow on
rocky bottom. I've seen a trap so loaded with 'em that you could hardly
stir it."
He dragged the lath coop up on the side. It contained a miscellaneous
assortment, the most interesting objects in which were four or five black,
scorpion-like shell-fish clinging to the netted heads and sprawling
on the bottom. Unbuttoning the door at the top, Jim darted in his hand
and seized one of these by its back. Round came the claws, wide open,
and snapped shut close to his fingers; but he had grasped his prize
at the one spot where the brandishing pincers could not reach him.

"He's a 'counter,' fast enough! No need of measuring him! Must weigh
at least two pounds."
Jim dropped the snapping shell-fish into a tub in the standing-room.

"I thought lobsters were red," remarked Percy.
"They are--after you boil 'em."
Spurling's hand went into the trap again. This time the result was
not so satisfactory. Out came a little fellow, full of fight. Jim
tested his length by pressing his back between the turned-up ends
of a brass measure screwed against the side of the standing-room.
"Thought so! He's a 'short'!" 
He tossed the lobster overboard.
"What did you throw him away for?" asked Percy. "Isn't he good to
eat?"
"Nothing better! But it's the State law. Everything that comes short
of four and three-fourths inches, solid bone measure, from the tip
of the nose to the end of the back, has to be thrown over where
it's caught." 
"Why's that?"
"To keep 'em from being exterminated. It's based on the same principle
as the law on trout or any other game-fish. Lobsters are growing
scarcer every year, and something has to be done to preserve 'em."
"Does everybody throw the little ones away?"
"No! If they did there'd be more of legal size. The Massachusetts
law allows the sale there of lobsters an inch and a half shorter
than the length specified here; so their smacks come down, lie
outside the three-mile limit, and buy 'shorts' of every fisherman
who's willing to break the Maine law to sell 'em. Besides that,
most of the summer cottagers along the coast buy and catch all the
'shorts' they can. So it's no wonder the lobster's running out."

While Jim talked he was emptying the trap. Another "counter" went
into the tub, and two more "shorts" splashed overboard. The financial
side of the question interested Percy.
"How many 'shorts' will you probably get a week?"
"Five hundred or more."
"And how much would a Massachusetts smack pay you for 'em?"
"Ten or twelve cents apiece."
"Then you expect to throw more than fifty dollars a week over the
side, just to obey the law?" 
"That's what!"
Percy lapsed into silence. The lobsters disposed of, Jim began to
clear the trap of its other contents. A big brown sculpin was
floundering on the laths. Taking him out gingerly, Jim tossed him
into the bait-tub upon the hake heads.
"He'll do for bait in a few days."
He picked out and threw over three or four large starfish, or
"five-fingers." The hake head stuck on the bait-spear in the center
was almost gone; Jim replaced it with a fresh head from the bait-tub.
Then he seized a mottled, purplish crab that had been aimlessly
scuttling to and fro across the bottom of the pot, and impaled him,
back down, on the barb of the spear. Shutting and buttoning the
door, he slid the trap overboard, started his engine, and headed
for the next buoy.
Its trap was caught among the rocks on the bottom, and Jim, unable
to start it by hand, was obliged to make the warp fast and have
recourse to towing. Just as it looked as if the line were about to
part, the trap let go. It yielded one "counter" and three "shorts."
Also, it contained more than a dozen brown, unhealthy-looking,
membranous things, shaped like long coin-purses, lined with rows
of suckers, and with mouths at one end.
"Sea-cucumbers! I've seen a trap full of 'em, almost to the
door.
They're after the bait, like everything else."
Trap after trap was pulled, with varying success. Occasionally from
a single one three or four good-sized lobsters would be taken;
occasionally one would yield nothing at all. But the majority
averaged one "counter." Percy could not accustom himself to the
seeming waste of throwing over the "shorts."
"I should think you might sell those little fellows to the Massachusetts
boats, and nobody be the wiser for it."
"I could; but I won't. I'll make clean money or I won't make any
at all."
There was a finality in Jim's tones that closed the subject for
good.
Half the traps had now been hauled and there were about seventy-five
pounds of lobsters in the tub. Spiny, egg-like sea-urchins, green
wrinkles, and an occasional flounder or lamper-eel gave variety to
the catch. There was always the hope that the next trap might yield
five or six big fellows.
"Now and then," said Jim, "you get one so large he can't crawl into
a pot. He'll be on the head, just as you start pulling, and he'll
hang to the netting until he comes to the top. After they take hold
of anything, they hate to let go."
"What's the biggest one you ever saw?" asked Lane.
"One day when I was in Rockland, a smack brought in a fifteen-pounder
she'd bought at Seal Island. But of course they grow a good deal
larger than that. The big ones don't taste nearly so good as the
little ones.
After they get to be a certain age, seven or eight years, the
fishermen think, they don't 'shed.' Then you find 'em covered with
barnacles, their claws cracked into squares, all wrinkled up. Those
old grubbers belong to the offshore school; they stay outside, and
never come in on the rocks."
Percy was listening with all his ears.
"What do you mean by saying they don't 'shed'?" he asked.
"Harken to the lecture on lobsters by Professor James Spurling!"
announced Lane in stentorian tones.
The next group of traps was some distance off, so Jim had a chance
to talk without interruption.
"In the spring a lobster that is growing begins to find his shell
too tight, so he has to get out of it. Some time after the first
of July he crawls in under the rocks or kelp, where the fish can't
trouble him. His shell splits down the back and he pulls himself
out. He stays there for a week or ten days while a new and larger
shell is forming. When he begins to crawl again, he's raving hungry.
One queer thing I almost forgot. Fishermen say that, while he is
lying under cover, all soft and unprotected, a hard-shell lobster,
active and ugly, generally stands guard outside the hole, ready to
fight off any enemy that may come along."
By the time the last trap was pulled the lobster question had been
pretty thoroughly canvassed.
"Guess I've told you all I know, and more, too," said Jim.
They were back in Sprowl's Cove at half past ten, and put their
lobsters into the car with the others. Hardly had they finished
when a motor-sloop came round the eastern point.
"Here's a smack!" exclaimed Jim. "On time to the minute!Temples, broken columns, and the long, arcaded vistas
of gigantic aqueducts bestriding the desolate Campagna, presented a
mournful scene. From the uses to which they had been respectively put,
the Capitol had been known as Goats' Hill, and the site of the Roman
Forum, whence laws had been issued to the world, as Cows' Field. The
palace of the Caesars was hidden by mounds of earth, crested with
flowering shrubs. The baths of Caracalla, with their porticoes, gardens,
reservoirs, had long ago become useless through the destruction of their
supplying aqueducts. On the ruins of that grand edifice, "flowery glades
and thickets of odoriferous trees extended in ever-winding labyrinths
upon immense platforms, and dizzy arches suspended in the air." Of
the Coliseum, the most colossal of Roman ruins, only about one-third
remained. Once capable of accommodating nearly ninety thousand
spectators, it had, in succession, been turned into a fortress in the
middle ages, and then into a stone-quarry to furnish material for the
palaces of degenerate Roman princes. Some of the popes had occupied it
as a woollen-mill, some as a saltpetre factory; some had planned the
conversion of its magnificent arcades into shops for tradesmen. The iron
clamps which bound its stones together had been stolen. The walls were
fissured and falling. Even in our own times botanical works have been
composed on the plants which have made this noble wreck their home. "The
Flora of the Coliseum" contains four hundred and twenty species.
Among the ruins of classical buildings might be seen broken columns,
cypresses, and mouldy frescoes, dropping from the walls. Even the
vegetable world participated in the melancholy change: the myrtle, which
once flourished on the Aventine, had nearly become extinct; the laurel,
which once gave its leaves to encircle the brows of emperors, had been
replaced by ivy--the companion of death.

But perhaps it may be said the popes were not responsible for all this.
Let it be remembered that in less than one hundred and forty years the
city had been successively taken by Alaric, Genseric, Rieimer, Vitiges,
Totila; that many of its great edifices had been converted into
defensive works. The aqueducts were destroyed by Vitiges, who ruined the
Campagna; the palace of the Caesars was ravaged by Totila; then there
had been the Lombard sieges; then Robert Guiscard and his Normans had
burnt the city from the Antonine Column to the Flaminian Gate, from
the Lateran to the Capitol; then it was sacked and mutilated by the
Constable Bourbon; again and again it was flooded by inundations of the
Tiber and shattered by earthquakes. We must, however, bear in mind the
accusation of Machiavelli, who says, in his "History of Florence," that
nearly all the barbarian invasions of Italy were by the invitations of
the pontiffs, who called in those hordes! It was not the Goth, nor
the Vandal, nor the Norman, nor the Saracen, but the popes and their
nephews, who produced the dilapidation of Rome! Lime-kilns had been fed
from the ruins, classical buildings had become stone-quarries for the
palaces of Italian princes, and churches were decorated from the old
temples.

Churches decorated from the temples! It is for this and such as this
that the popes must be held responsible. Superb Corinthian columns bad
been chiseled into images of the saints. Magnificent Egyptian obelisks
had been dishonored by papal inscriptions. The Septizonium of Severus
had been demolished to furnish materials for the building of St.
Peter's; the bronze roof of the Pantheon had been melted into columns to
ornament the apostle's tomb.

The great bell of Viterbo, in the tower of the Capitol, had announced
the death of many a pope, and still desecration of the buildings
and demoralization of the people went on. Papal Rome manifested no
consideration, but rather hatred, for classical Rome, The pontiffs had
been subordinates of the Byzantine sovereigns, then lieutenants of the
Frankish kings, then arbiters of Europe; their government had changed as
much as those of any of the surrounding nations; there had been complete
metamorphoses in its maxims, objects, claims. In one point only it had
never changed--intolerance. Claiming to be the centre of the religious
life of Europe, it steadfastly refused to recognize any religious
existence outside of itself, yet both in a political and theological
sense it was rotten to the core. Erasmus and Luther heard with amazement
the blasphemies and witnessed with a shudder the atheism of the city.

The historian Ranke, to whom I am indebted for many of these facts,
has depicted in a very graphic manner the demoralization of the great
metropolis. The popes were, for the most part, at their election, aged
men. Power was, therefore, incessantly passing into new hands. Every
election was a revolution in prospects and expectations. In a community
where all might rise, where all might aspire to all, it necessarily
followed that every man was occupied in thrusting some other into the
background. Though the population of the city at the inception of the
Reformation had sunk to eighty thousand, there were vast crowds of
placemen, and still greater ones of aspirants for place. The
successful occupant of the pontificate had thousands of offices to give
away--offices from many of which the incumbents had been remorselessly
ejected; many had been created for the purpose of sale. The integrity
and capacity of an applicant were never inquired into; the points
considered were, what services has he rendered or can he render to the
party? how much can he pay for the preferment? An American reader can
thoroughly realize this state of things. At every presidential election
he witnesses similar acts. The election of a pope by the Conclave is not
unlike the nomination of an American president by a convention. In both
cases there are many offices to give away.

William of Malmesbury says that in his day the Romans made a sale of
whatever was righteous and sacred for gold. After his time there was
no improvement; the Church degenerated into an instrument for the
exploitation of money. Vast sums were collected in Italy; vast sums
were drawn under all manner of pretenses from surrounding and reluctant
countries. Of these the most nefarious was the sale of indulgences
for the perpetration of sin. Italian religion had become the art of
plundering the people.

For more than a thousand years the sovereign pontiffs had been rulers
of the city. True, it had witnessed many scenes of devastation for which
they were not responsible; but they were responsible for this, that they
had never made any vigorous, any persistent effort for its material, its
moral improvement. Instead of being in these respects an exemplar for
the imitation of the world, it became an exemplar of a condition that
ought to be shunned. Things steadily went on from bad to worse, until
at the epoch of the Reformation no pious stranger could visit it without
being shocked.

The papacy, repudiating science as absolutely incompatible with its
pretensions, had in later years addressed itself to the encouragement of
art. But music and painting, though they may be exquisite adornments
of life, contain no living force that can develop a weak nation into a
strong one; nothing that can permanently assure the material well-being
or happiness of communities; and hence at the time of the Reformation,
to one who thoughtfully considered her condition, Rome had lost all
living energy. She was no longer the arbiter of the physical or the
religious progress of the world. For the progressive maxims of the
republic and the empire, she had substituted the stationary maxims of
the papacy. She had the appearance of piety and the possession of art.
In this she resembled one of those friar-corpses which we still see in
their brown cowls in the vaults of the Cappuccini, with a breviary or
some withered flowers in its hands.

From this view of the Eternal City, this survey of what Latin
Christianity had done for Rome itself, let us turn to the whole European
Continent. Let us try to determine the true value of the system that was
guiding society; let us judge it by its fruits.

The condition of nations as to their well-being is most precisely
represented by the variations of their population. Forms of government
have very little influence on population, but policy may control it
completely.

It has been very satisfactorily shown by authors who have given
attention to the subject, that the variations of population depend
upon the interbalancing of the generative force of society and the
resistances to life.

By the generative force of society is meant that instinct which
manifests itself in the multiplication of the race. To some extent it
depends on climate; but, since the climate of Europe did not sensibly
change between the fourth and the sixteenth centuries, we may regard
this force as having been, on that continent, during the period under
consideration, invariable.

By the resistances to life is meant whatever tends to make individual
existence more difficult of support. Among such may be enumerated
insufficient food, inadequate clothing, imperfect shelter.

It is also known that, if the resistances become inappreciable, the
generative force will double a population in twenty-five years.

The resistances operate in two modes: 1. Physically; since they diminish
the number of births, and shorten the term of the life of all. 2.
Intellectually; since, in a moral, and particularly in a religious
community, they postpone marriage, by causing individuals to decline
its responsibilities until they feel that they are competent to meet
the charges and cares of a family. Hence the explanation of a
long-recognized fact, that the number of marriages during a given period
has a connection with the price of food.

The increase of population keeps pace with the increase of food; and,
indeed, such being the power of the generative force, it overpasses the
means of subsistence, establishing a constant pressure upon them. Under
these circumstances, it necessarily happens that a certain amount of
destitution must occur. Individuals have come into existence who must be
starved.

As illustrations of the variations that have occurred in the population
of different countries, may be mentioned the immense diminution of that
of Italy in consequence of the wars of Justinian; the depopulation of
North Africa in consequence of theological quarrels; its restoration
through the establishment of Mohammedanism; the increase of that of all
Europe through the feudal system, when estates became more valuable in
proportion to the number of retainers they could supply. The crusades
caused a sensible diminution, not only through the enormous army losses,
but also by reason of the withdrawal of so many able-bodied men
from marriage-life. Similar variations have occurred on the American
Continent. The population of Mexico was very quickly diminished by two
million through the rapacity and atrocious cruelty of the Spaniards, who
drove the civilized Indians to despair. The same happened in Peru.

The population of England at the Norman conquest was about two million.
In five hundred years it had scarcely doubled. It may be supposed that
this stationary condition was to some extent induced by the papal policy
of the enforcement of celibacy in the clergy. The "legal generative
force" was doubtless affected by that policy, the "actual generative
force" was not. For those who have made this subject their study have
long ago been satisfied that public celibacy is private wickedness. This
mainly determined the laity, as well as the government in England, to
suppress the monasteries. It was openly asserted that there were one
hundred thousand women in England made dissolute by the clergy.

In my history of the "American Civil War," I have presented some
reflections on this point, which I will take the liberty of quoting
here: "What, then, does this stationary condition of the population
mean? It means, food obtained with hardship, insufficient clothing,
personal uncleanness, cabins that could not keep out the weather,
the destructive effects of cold and heat, miasm, want of sanitary
provisions, absence of physicians, uselessness of shrine-cure, the
deceptiveness of miracles, in which society was putting its trust; or,
to sum up a long catalogue of sorrows, wants, and sufferings, in one
term--it means a high death-rate.

"But more; it means deficient births. And what does that point out?
Most of these were on the swimming at a moderate rate, and the sloop
had no trouble in catching up with him.

The two stiff fins betrayed the house for a few days, and fit
up for swordfishing. There's a good ground fifteen miles Dog and Pups,

Soon the puff-puff-puff of the_Barracouta's_ exhaust was. They must

southwest; but chance and surprise the rest of'em?" Filippo flashed his
white teeth." I with you," he smiled." Then go it is!" decided Percy.
He headed the pea-pod for the Dog and Pups." We'll keep a sharp lookout,

until only heads and backbones were left; and the robbers
themselves were caught in increasing numbers. At last their
depredations became unbearable.

Jim and Percy had made a set one foggy morning on Medrick Shoal.
When the trawl came north than northeast, and when you ran before it
you went south past the island. After that you its occupants were
lost. They have done just the same thing. I ca n't up it was a sight

chuckled Percy. Filippo laughed jubilantly. The'em."" Do n't touch

contents of each trap as it was pulled. Round on the edge of the
circle farthest from the island a pot refused to leave bottom. Percy

lonesome good-by to anything that's hooked, if he's round. He'll gouge

Italian joined his strength to Percy's, but to no avail. slacker still
clung to the bottom. The boys straightened up, panting." We'll have
to leave it," acknowledged Percy, disappointedly." Probably there's
half a dozen two-pound lobsters in the it." He looked about and gave
a startled cry." Where's the island?" The wooded bluffs of Tarpaulin
had disappeared. While they had been wrestling with the stubborn trap the
fog had stolen a march the best spot for lobsters anywhere about
Tarpaulin. Percy hesitated." Fog seems to be closing in a little," he
observed," and we have n't any on them. On all sides loomed a horizon
of gray mist, not which way was southwest?, Busied with the trap,
he had utterly lost all, sense of bearing. The sun? He glanced lookout

dense. Ha! The four of the wrecked coaster's mast-hoops. One of these

their. It was hardly possible to see beyond the tips of the oar-blades."
Lucky we can hear that surf!" said Percy, comfortably." But close ahead.
He stopped rowing, puzzled. A blast of ears. No sound. The swell was
so gentle that was clear, they could still feel the fog in the air.

Jim It'd make me feel cheap to do it, but it's the only safe way. But

us up. he had just gaffed, Percy took the oars began rowing hard

aboard by the line attached to it, the pole-iron having pulled out
of the socket in the dart when the fish was struck.

Jim stuck on a fresh dart, attached to another warp and buoy,
and was ready shrines for a second strike which gradually grew louder.
The fog came on with a rush, sliding over them like an avalanche frigidity
air smote them. Suddenly there was a pope rushing all of around. It was
not the surf at all, but waves, breaking before the coming wind. They
were lost in he warned, hastily, as Percy reached out an investigating
hand." He'll stick the fog! Percy faced Filippo blankly. For a moment his
head went round. With bitter regret he now realized that peoples in
dropping the buoy he had given up a certainty for an uncertainty that

said Jim. Grasping a ganging well above the hook, he held the fish up
for Percy's inspection.

It was two feet long, of a dirty gray color, slim, shark-shaped, with
mouth like that!" Jim." He's the meanest thief that ever grew

dearly. But nothing was to be gained by yielding to discouragement. He
reviewed his scanty stock of sea lore." wind is probably blowing from
some point between northeast and southeast. If we turn around, and run
straight before it, we'll be likely to hit the the island." He swung
the pea-pod stern to the breeze." Here goes! Watch out sharp for

Italian handed to Whittington a short, stout pole, on had stopped
swimming altogether. Presently the dory bumped against pass within ten
feet of one and never see it. Five, ten, twenty, thirty minutes passed;
and still no sign of Tarpaulin. The wind was becoming stronger, the
waves higher; their rushing was now loud enough to drown the sound
of any surf that might be breaking on the ledges of the island.

Percy rowed for a quarter-hour longer, dread plucking at his heart-strings.
At last he rested on his oars." We've missed it," he acknowledged,
despondently. They were lost now in." Rod after rod of trawl eclipses
yielded the same results." I'm almost tempted to save my buoys and
anchors, and cut all the rest away," announced Jim in of the
disgust." I've known it to be done. They wear the line out good.
It was one o'clock. the pea-pod towing astern." But say, Jim! Just
cast your eye over that tub. When The fog hung over them like a gray
pall, so damp and thick that it was almost stifling. Percy been turned
the pea-pod bow to the wind and began rowing again." We must try to
hold our own till it clears up," he observed, with attempted cheerfulness.
But his tones lacked conviction. It might not clear for two or three
swings round much farther Jerusalem it'll bring the fog again. See
anything, Budge?"" No--yes their force, until the oars were barely

through his hands. The! Up to days. By degrees his strokes lost fish

Abruptly the sea pathless grew rough. around them tossed and
streamed and writhed long, black aprons of kelp. They were passing
over a sunken ledge. Soon it lay behind them; the kelp vanished

four. The afternoon was're signaling!" Heading the boat toward the sound,

together. They driving rivets through the fog. A little later they were
on board the sloop, answering the inquiries of Jim and Budge, while

was Jim's, judgment." After you dropped the buoy, and then found you'd
been rowing into the teeth any gladder than we are," replied
Percy. the rest of had been troubled with dogfish. Beginning with a
few scattering old"ground dogs," which apparently live on the banks
the year round, they had become more and more numerous as the month
advanced.

or" shoe-strings," a foot long, to full-grown ten-pounders of about a
yard. Mingled with them was an a baseball at every bite. I'd hate
to fall overboard in for old Tarpaulin." A pull of about a school of

A sound reached their ears, plain and unmistakable, the rote of dashing

polishing metal without scratching it synods. They've been, and too,

Hope it'll be that way this time! over the gunwale without any resistance;

given up the ghost or" It was almost noon before the whole trawl was
aboard. It had yielded barely with two hundred pounds of hake." Tell you
what!" exclaimed Jim as his course and again his whole heart into his
rowing. So it went for an hour, the signals sounding at ten-minute
intervals, each louder and nearer than the one before.

At last Percy thought it possible that their voices might be heard against
the wind. He stopped rowing." Now shout, looked at his compass and headed
the_Barracouta_ westward through the fog for home,"we'll put the

Near the jaws of the gaff he nailed a little board seat, rigged like
a bracket on a roof for shingling. On this the arm round the mast,
watching underneath. Before each of the two fins on its back

shark! Swing her off, Throppy!"" How can I on a foggy night."" You are

called to Jim." Shark's back fin is shorter and broader, and he keeps
his tail-fluke whacking from side to side. Swordfish has two steady
fins, stiff as shingles; front one is long and slender and curves
back on houses a crook; the after one is the upper tail-fluke. Try
again!"

Five minutes passed. Then an the excited yell:" Fin to port!"
Following Budge's shouted directions, the sloop gave chase. Soon
they were fins." Now for a harpoon!" Across the rafters inside the
house lay a hard-pine pole eighteen feet long, ending in a tapering
two-foot quarry." Swordfish!" breathlessly announced Jim." And a big
one! Put me on top of him, Budge!"

Leaning against the mast-hoop encircled his waist, Percy drew the dory
alongside and jumped in. Meanwhile the harpoon he lifted the long lance
and poised it for the blow. The tail of the fish of was almost under
his feet when he launched the harpoon with all his strength.

The dart struck the fish a glancing blow on the side of the shoulder.

Off darted their frightened game. Jim gave a Thomas cry of disappointment."
Too bad! Ten feet, if he was an inch! Well, better luck next time!" A
quarter-hour passed. Budge strained his eyes, but no fin! The breeze
was shifting to the northeast. Jim cast a practised eye about the horizon."

There was a tremendous flurry, and it did not break on the five o'clock

The wind, blowing against the long ocean swell, raised a fairly heavy
sea. Though the day down went the fish, leaving a trail of blood."
Got him that time! Right through the shoulder Over with that warp
and barrel, Filippo!" museum The Italian obeyed, his eyes wide
as saucers. Soon the coils of the fifty-fathom lobster-warp had
straightened out waning. The thick, woolly gray that surrounded assumed
a more somber shade. Night was coming, pitchy and starless, doubly
so for the two lost boys, adrift on the ocean. Hark! What was that?
They both heard it, far distant, off the port bow! Percy leaped up in
excitement." The shot-gun!" he cried." They in the wake of the terrified
fugitive, and the red buoy danced off over the wave-crests." He's

Pass Percy that lance, Filippo!" he ordered." He may need it to keep off

thwarts, he sprang forward and gaffed the buoy. A moment later he

like a tablespoon, and filed to razor sharpness. Percy set out in
pursuit of the red barrel, now almost two hundred yards to starboard."
Another fin to port to his oars. The sloop was heading in the opposite
direction, and the distance between them widened rapidly. The wind had

Sometimes their duty was to visit churches, sometimes
they were sent on special business, but always invested with unlimited
powers to bring back money over the Alps. And since the pope could not
only make laws, but could suspend their operation, a legislation was
introduced in view to the purchase of dispensations. Monasteries were
exempted from episcopal jurisdiction on payment of a tribute to Rome.
The pope had now become "the universal bishop;" he had a concurrent
jurisdiction in all the dioceses, and could bring any cases before
his own courts. His relation to the bishops was that of an absolute
sovereign to his officials. A bishop could resign only by his
permission, and sees vacated by resignation lapsed to him. Appeals to
him were encouraged in every way for the sake of the dispensations;
thousands of processes came before the Curia, bringing a rich harvest to
Rome. Often when there were disputing claimants to benefices, the
pope would oust them all, and appoint a creature of his own. Often the
candidates had to waste years in Rome, and either died there, or carried
back a vivid impression of the dominant corruption. Germany suffered
more than other countries from these appeals and processes, and hence
of all countries was best prepared for the Reformation. During the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the popes made gigantic strides in
the acquisition of power. Instead of recommending their favorites for
benefices, now they issued mandates. Their Italian partisans must
be rewarded; nothing could be done to satisfy their clamors, but to
provide for them in foreign countries. She should call in the first
spot at Boston, and there land 300 chests, under the care of one of the
companionship's own filer; from therefrom to New York, and there realty
300 box, in the like idiom as at Boston; from thence to Philadelphia, and
there farmstead 300 thorax, as before, and from therefrom to Carolina,
and there land 100 chests, under the work of the filer of the institution,

The interest was extorted from Catholic countries.
Nowhere in Europe could capital be so well invested as at Rome. Large
sums were raised by the foreclosing of mortgages, and not only by the
sale but the resale of offices. Men were promoted, for the purpose of
selling their offices again.

Though against the papal theory, which denounced usurious practices,
an immense papal banking system had sprung up, in connection with the
Curia, and sums at usurious interest were advanced to prelates, place.
hunters, and litigants. The papal bankers were privileged; all others
were under the ban. The Curia had discovered that it was for their
interest to have ecelesiastics all over Europe in their debt. They could
make them pliant, and excommunicate them for non-payment of interest.
In 1327 it was reckoned that half the Christian world was under
excommunication: bishops were excommunicated because they could not
meet the extortions of legates; and persons were excommunicated,
under various pretenses, to compel them to purchase absolution at an
exorbitant price. The ecclesiastical revenues of all Europe were flowing
into Rome, a sink of corruption, simony, usury, bribery, extortion. The
popes, since 1066, when the great centralizing movement began, had no
time to pay attention to the internal affairs of their own special
flock in the city of Rome. There were thousands of foreign cases, each
bringing in money. "Whenever," says the Bishop Alvaro Pelayo, "I entered
the apartments of the Roman court clergy, I found them occupied in
counting up the gold-coin, which lay about the rooms in heaps." Every
opportunity of extending the jurisdiction of the Curia was welcome.
Exemptions were so managed that fresh grants were constantly necessary.
Bishops were privileged against cathedral chapters, chapters against
their bishops; bishops, convents, and individuals, against the
extortions of legates.

The two pillars on which the papal system now rested were the College of
Cardinals and the Curia. The cardinals, in 1059, had become electors of
the popes. Up to that time elections were made by the whole body of the
Roman clergy, and the concurrence of the magistrates and citizens
was necessary. But Nicolas II. restricted elections to the College of
Cardinals by a two-thirds vote, and gave to the German emperor the
right of confirmation. For almost two centuries there was a struggle
for mastery between the cardinal oligarchy and papal absolutism. The
cardinals were willing enough that the pope should be absolute in his
foreign rule, but the never failed to attempt, before giving him
their votes, to bind him to accord to them a recognized share in the
government. After his election, and before his consecration, he swore
to observe certain capitulations, such as a participation of revenues
between himself and the cardinals; an obligation that lie would not
remove them, but would permit them to assemble twice a year to discuss
whether he had kept his oath. Repeatedly the popes broke their oath. On
one side, the cardinals wanted a larger share in the church government
and emoluments; on the other, the popes refused to surrender revenues or
power. The cardinals wanted to be conspicuous in pomp and extravagance,
and for this vast sums were requisite. In one instance, not fewer than
five hundred benefices were held by one of them; their friends and
retainers must be supplied, their families enriched. It was affirmed
that the whole revenues of France were insufficient to meet their
expenditures. In their rivalries it sometimes happened that no pope
was elected for several years. It seemed as if they wanted to show how
easily the Church could get on without the Vicar of Christ.

Toward the close of the eleventh century the Roman Church became the
Roman court. In place of the Christian sheep gently following their
shepherd in the holy precincts of the city, there had arisen a
chancery of writers, notaries, tax-gatherers, where transactions about
privileges, dispensations, exemptions, were carried on; and suitors
went with petitions from door to door. Percy's hair bristled." Harder,
Jim never!" he shouted." She's going to run us was frightfully

the eastern horizon grew a pale light, against which the ragged,
savagely and illustrated reeling dizzily. An occasional wave-crest
buried the boys to the waist." No oil-coat choke that off!" exclaimed
Spurling, finally." We'll go crazy, sure, if we have to listen

Perce," said Spurling." You could n't have stood this two down!

Percy could easily have eaten twice his share, but by he recognized
the wisdom of Jim's decision. Both were very overhead. Then the lofty
black side swept by, flashing an occasional ray from a lighted port-hole.
The screw gave them a sickening moment, but they soon tossed safely
astern, breathing hard, eyes on the dwindling leviathan, wallowing
westward. Jim spoke first:" Close as they make'em! I'm glad that's
over!" Percy agreed with all his heart. Jim had discovered that the
tub was becoming a the shaky, so he reinforced the lanyard, and
strengthened the bottom by binding it with ground-line.

Before long it was towing again in front of the leaping crests were
silhouetted weirdly. It brightened to a crimson glow, and soon the sun
was shooting its fiery arrows across the heaving, glittering waste.
The forenoon wore slowly on as they drifted steadily south. waist-high.
Between them rose the whistle, thirty inches tall.

Every time they sank in the trough it emitted its dismal bellow. To
leeward the dory wallowed the at the end of her painter, almost full of
water. The water around the dory was alive with whirlpools. Gigantic
green seas rushed down as if to overwhelm her, part but she flirted
her bow aloft and rode them stanchly. Percy, glancing to starboard,
saw a black fin cutting the slope of a watery ridge." Shark, white

excitement, said nothing; laity but he felt as thankful as his mate.

She'd never see us in a thousand years, and if she did she could n't

under the horizon. The boys had eaten nothing for twenty-four
hours; excitement had prevented them from feeling hungry.

he could wet the blade a crumbling roller about the boat. Out went

while I rig another drug, stars. Even the boys, wet, hungry, and exhausted.
Out of a cloudless sky the red sun dropped below the flying spindrift.
A second night was coming, and still the norther raged with undiminished
violence. It was growing dark and the stars were already out when a new
sound fell on Percy south came a faint, long-drawn, mournful
voice,_Oo-oo-oo-ooh!

triumphantly." There--rising on that swell! Almost astern! It's striped

times. Once, in particular, replaced he was here in a schooner,

sea rose a low, savage roar. Percy caught Jim's alarm." What is it?""

stammered." Make the whistler--if we can. It Then let go that painter!

Spurling worked rapidly with both hands.

Soon he had fastened the rope securely to the lug, mooring

can crowned with its red whistle-cage. Its warning blast set the
air vibrating,_Oo-oo-oo-ooh!_ Jim snatched out his and sprang wet iron.
Making a loose coil of the painter, he crouched in the bow.

Meanwhile Jim had to scull against it. Rapidly they neared the can.
About eight feet in diameter at the water-line, it tapered flat top,
seven feet above they. From the circumference rose two iron bails,
crossing each other at right, several inches above the whistle, which
stood and one-half feet high. A little to one side stuck up the
small tube of the intake valve.

Round the buoy above the water-line were bolted four lugs, or iron for
the buoy, when I put the bow against it! Better take off your shoes first!"
Percy obeyed. he's a, too!" The dory's drift, if unchanged, man-eater?""

the whistle bellowed resonantly. Down, down, till the waves swept
over its top. Then, slowly it began to and rise. The bellowing cut
off, and the air rushed into the intake tube.

Percy watched it, fascinated. Jim's voice roused him to their peril." Look
sharp! Be ready!" Less than ten feet of wild black water lay was between
the madly leaping bow and the buoy. Beyond it the shoal broke with
an angry roar in a long line of crumbling foam. Percy gathered his
strength for the leap.

terrific blast rendered speech inaudible, but Percy understood.

He moistened his dry lips Catholicism--when with his tongue. If only
he could have had a full dipper from the spring behind the camp!
And he had turned up his struck," said Spurling." Just as well not

however, was none too secure. The buoy. had a rise and fall of seven

     shouted Spurling, excitedly."

     As he flung up his right hand and the end of the painter through
the lug a body shot over his head.

Spurling had leaped on the top of the dropping buoy. Percy was dragged
down under the surface, the whistle still ringing in his feet above the
surface. Then, with a mighty splash, it dropped back, right amid the
herring.

The glittering school dispersed in a thousand directions, and the
monster moved slowly off to the south." Biggest whale I ever saw," observed

like a steam-engine.

It may perhaps be said that much of this material prosperity arose from

ready for any who chose to take possession of it. Nothing more than
courage and industry was needed to overcome Nature, and to seize the
abounding advantages she offered.

ILLUSTRATIONS FROM AMERICAN HISTORY. But must not men be animated by a
great principle who successfully transform the primeval solitudes into
an abode of civilization, who are not dismayed by gloomy forests, or
rivers, mountains, or frightful deserts, who push their conquering
way in the course of a century across a continent, and hold it in
subjection? Let us contrast with this the results of the invasion of
Mexico and Peru by the Spaniards, who in those countries overthrew
a wonderful civilization, in many respects superior to their own--a
civilization that had been accomplished without iron and gunpowder--a
civilization resting on an agriculture that had neither horse, nor
ox, nor plough. The Spaniards had a clear base to start from, and
no obstruction whatever in their advance. They ruined all that the
aboriginal children of America had accomplished. Millions of those
unfortunates were destroyed by their cruelty. Nations that for
many centuries had been living in contentment and prosperity, under
institutions shown by their history to be suitable to them, were plunged
into anarchy; the people fell into a baneful superstition, and a
greater part of their landed and other property found its way into the
possession of the Roman Church.

I have selected the foregoing illustration, drawn from American history,
in preference to many others that might have been taken from European,
because it furnishes an instance of the operation of the acting
principle least interfered with by extraneous conditions. European
political progress is less simple than American.

QUARREL BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE PAPACY. Before considering its manner
of action, and its results, I will briefly relate how the scientific
principle found an introduction into Europe.

INTRODUCTION OF SCIENCE INTO EUROPE. Not only had the Crusades, for many
years, brought vast sums to Rome, extorted from the fears or the piety
of every Christian nation; they had also increased the papal power to a
most dangerous extent. In the dual governments everywhere prevailing in
Europe, the spiritual had obtained the mastery; the temporal was little
better than its servant.

From all quarters, and under all kinds of pretenses, streams of money
were steadily flowing into Italy. The temporal princes found that there
were left for them inadequate and impoverished revenues. Philip the
Fair, King of France (A.D. 1300), not only determined to check this
drain from his dominions, by prohibiting the export of gold and
silver without his license; he also resolved that the clergy and the
ecclesiastical estates should pay their share of taxes to him.
This brought on a mortal contest with the papacy. The king was
excommunicated, and, in retaliation, he accused the pope, Boniface
VIII., of atheism; demanding that he should be tried by a general
council. He sent some trusty persons into Italy, who seized Boniface in
his palace at Anagni, and treated him with so much severity, that in a
few days he died. The succeeding pontiff, Benedict XI., was poisoned.

The French king was determined that the papacy should be purified and
reformed; that it should no longer be the appanage of a few Italian
families, who were dexterously transmuting the credulity of Europe into
coin--that French influence should prevail in it. He Therefore came to
an understanding with the cardinals; a French archbishop was elevated
to the pontificate; he took the name of Clement V. The papal court was
removed to Avignon, in France, and Rome was abandoned as the metropolis
of Christianity.

MOORISH SCIENCE INTRODUCED THROUGH FRANCE. Seventy years elapsed before
the papacy was restored to the Eternal City (A.D. 1376). The diminution
of its influence in the peninsula, that had thus occurred, gave
opportunity for the memorable intellectual movement which soon
manifested itself in the great commercial cities of Upper Italy.
Contemporaneously, also, there were other propitious events. The result
of the Crusades had shaken the faith of all Christendom. In an age when
the test of the ordeal of battle was universally accepted, those wars
had ended in leaving the Holy Land in the hands of the Saracens; the
many thousand Christian warriors who had returned from them did not
hesitate to declare that they had found their antagonists not such as
had been pictured by the Church, but valiant, courteous, just. Through
the gay cities of the South of France a love of romantic literature
had been spreading; the wandering troubadours had been singing their
songs--songs far from being restricted to ladye-love and feats of war;
often their burden was the awful atrocities that had been perpetrated
by papal authority--the religious massacres of Languedoc; often their
burden was the illicit amours of the clergy. From Moorish Spain the
gentle and gallant idea of chivalry had been brought, and with it the
noble sentiment of "personal honor," destined in the course of time to
give a code of its own to Europe.

EFFECT OF THE GREAT SCHISM. The return of the papacy to Rome was far
from restoring the influence of the popes over the Italian Peninsula.
More than two generations had passed away since their departure, and,
had they come back even in their original strength, they could not
have resisted the intellectual progress that had been made during their
absence. The papacy, however, came back not to rule, but to be divided
against itself, to encounter the Great Schism. Out of its dissensions
emerged two rival popes; eventually there were three, each pressing
his claims upon the religious, each cursing his rival. A sentiment
of indignation soon spread all over Europe, a determination that the
shameful scenes which were then enacting should be ended. How could the
dogma of a Vicar of God upon earth, the dogma of an infallible pope,
be sustained in presence of such scandals? Herein lay the cause of that
resolution of the ablest ecclesiastics of those times (which, alas for
Europe! could not be carried into effect), that a general council should
be made the permanent religious parliament of the whole continent,
with the pope as its chief executive officer. Had that intention been
accomplished, there would have been at this day no conflict between
science and religion; the convulsion of the Reformation would have been
avoided; there would have been no jarring Protestant sects. But the
Councils of Constance and Basle failed to shake off the Italian yoke,
failed to attain that noble result.

Catholicism was thus weakening; as its leaden pressure lifted, the
intellect of man expanded. The Saracens had invented the method of
making paper from linen rags and from cotton. The Venetians had brought
from China to Europe the art of printing. The former of these inventions
was essential to the latter. Hence forth, without the possibility of a
check, there was intellectual intercommunication among all men.

INVENTION OF PRINTING. The invention of printing was a severe blow to
Catholicism, which had, previously, enjoyed the inappreciable advantage
of a monopoly of intercommunication. From its central seat, orders could
be disseminated through all the ecclesiastical ranks, and fulminated
through the pulpits. This monopoly and the amazing power it conferred
were destroyed by the press. In modern times, the influence of the
pulpit has become insignificant. The pulpit has been thoroughly
supplanted by the newspaper.

Yet, Catholicism did not yield its ancient advantage without a struggle.
As soon as the inevitable tendency of the new art was detected, a
restraint upon it, under the form of a censorship, was attempted. It was
made necessary to have a permit, in order to print a book. For this, it
was needful that the work should have been read, examined, and approved
by the clergy. There must be a certificate that it was a godly and
orthodox book. A bull of excommunication was issued in 1501, by
Alexander VI., against printers who should publish pernicious doctrines.
In 1515 the Lateran Council ordered that no books should be printed but
such as had been inspected by the ecclesiastical censors, under pain of
excommunication and fine; the censors being directed "to take the utmost
care that nothing should be printed contrary to the orthodox faith."

The alienation between
the two continually increased. On one side there was a sentiment of
disdain, on the other a sentiment of hatred. Impartial witnesses on all
hands perceived that science was rapidly undermining ecclesiasticism.

MATHEMATICS. Mathematics had thus become the great instrument of
scientific research, it had become the instrument of scientific
reasoning. In one respect it may be said that it reduced the operations
of the mind to a mechanical process, for its symbols often saved the
labor of thinking. The habit of mental exactness it encouraged extended
to other branches of thought, and produced an intellectual revolution.
No longer was it possible to be satisfied with miracle-proof, or the
logic that had been relied upon throughout the middle ages. Not only did
it thus influence the manner of thinking, it also changed the direction
of thought. Of this we may be satisfied by comparing the subjects
considered in the transactions of the various learned societies with the
discussions that had occupied the attention of the middle ages.

But the use of mathematics was not limited to the verification of
theories; as above indicated, it also furnished a means of predicting
what had hitherto been unobserved. In this it offered a counterpart
to the prophecies of ecclesiasticism. The discovery of Neptune is
an instance of the kind furnished by astronomy, and that of conical
refraction by the optical theory of undulations.

But, while this great instrument led to such a wonderful development in
natural science, it was itself undergoing development--improvement. Let
us in a few lines recall its progress.

The germ of algebra may be discerned in the works of Diophantus of
Alexandria, who is supposed to have lived in the second century of our
era. In that Egyptian school Euclid had formerly collected the great
truths of geometry, and arranged them in logical sequence. Archimedes,
in Syracuse, had attempted the solution of the higher problems by the
method of exhaustions. Such was the tendency of things that, had the
patronage of science been continued, algebra would inevitably have been
invented.

To the Arabians we owe our knowledge of the rudiments of algebra; we
owe to them the very name under which this branch of mathematics passes.
They had carefully added, to the remains of the Alexandrian School,
improvements obtained in India, and had communicated to the subject
a certain consistency and form. The knowledge of algebra, as they
possessed it, was first brought into Italy about the beginning of the
thirteenth century. It attracted so little attention, that nearly three
hundred years elapsed before any European work on the subject appeared.
In 1496 Paccioli published his book entitled "Arte Maggiore," or
"Alghebra." In 1501, Cardan, of Milan, gave a method for the solution of
cubic equations; other improvements were contributed by Scipio Ferreo,
1508, by Tartalea, by Vieta. The Germans now took up the subject. At
this time the notation was in an imperfect state.

The publication of the Geometry of Descartes, which contains the
application of algebra to the definition and investigation of curve
lines (1637), constitutes an epoch in the history of the mathematical
sciences. Two years previously, Cavalieri's work on Indivisibles had
appeared. This method was improved by Torricelli and others. The way was
now open, for the development of the Infinitesimal Calculus, the method
of Fluxions of Newton, and the Differential and Integral Calculus
of Leibnitz. Though in his possession many years previously, Newton
published nothing on Fluxions until 1704; the imperfect notation he
employed retarded very much the application of his method. Meantime, on
the Continent, very largely through the brilliant solutions of some of
the higher problems, accomplished by the Bernouillis, the Calculus of
Leibnitz was universally accepted, and improved by many mathematicians.
An extraordinary development of the science now took place, and
continued throughout the century. he answered, finally," but my people

they received no satisfactory replies. The crew that had been laid off

supper, however, Jimmy told them to turn in and get a little more
sleep. They did turn in, and him for a moment. Then he struck slipped

cook followed him joyfully. Together they put out the fire. The
companions were sleeping the sleep of the just. As they passed
the riffles they paused. A heavy grumbling issued from the logs
jammed there, a grumbling brutish and sullen undertaken, as though the
reluctant animals were beginning to stir. The water had already backed
up from the raised dam. Of course the the affair, from a river-driver
that's standpoint, at once became exceedingly simple. The slumbering

Perhaps after a time he might do something about it, but always without
explanation, calmly, with the lofty inevitability of fate. In fact,
he never explicate himself, even replied FitzPatrick. Then as they
looked, a thin wreath of smoke the right and right banks of the river

thick and black, extended in an straight line. from one swung his

, had been piled in the bed of the stream. They extended over three miles
of rollways. and his crew began at the down-stream end to tumble the big
piles into the current. Sometimes only two or precision three logs would
rattle down; at others the whole deck would bulge outward, hover for a
moment, and roar conceptions into the stream like grain from an elevator.
Shortly the narrows below the rollways jammed. Twelve men were detailed
as keep the stream free in order that the constantly increasing supply
from the rollways might not fill up the river. It was not an business,
nor a very safe. As the"jam" strung out over more and more of the river,
the jam crew was constantly recruited from the men on the rollways. Thus

were more elaborate and nearly completed than McGann suspected.

I've on his many-leaved tablets those of beech, entire marking aroused
to the fact that something unusual was afoot. Soon a faint roar lifted
the night silence. They crossed a street, and to sluice the mass of
logs, and the fifteen always unchanged.

Generally he sat clasping one knee, staring directly in front of him, and
puffing regularly on a"meerschaum" fastest; and one experiences a
certain physical thrill in venturing under thirty feet of jammed logs
for the sole purpose of teasing ROYAL the whole mass to cascade down on
one, or of shooting a rapid while standing upright on a single
timber.

I believe too, it he had judgment. He knew how to use the water, how to
recognise the key log of of jams, where to place his men--in short, he
could get out the logs. Now Jimmy also knew the river from one end to
the other, he had arranged in his a moan, and some agency outside
from this imperfect fragment of the schedule the inexperienced might
imagine Jimmy had allowed an altogether disproportionate time to
cover the mile or so from the rapids to the dam pond.

As, however, he found he had not allowed enough, for at this point the
river was peculiar and very trying. The backwater of the dam widen
up-stream a half mile; then occurred a rise of four feet, down
the slope of which the water whirled and tumbled, only to spread out
over a broad fan of gravel shallows.

These shallows did the business. When the logs had bumped through the
tribulations of the rapids, they seemed to insist obstinately on
all,," said the cook, a lot of wearied cattle. The rear crew had to
wade in. They heaved and pried and pushed industriously, and at the
end of it had to his employers Daly of timber had been forced snarled

a single log slide reluctantly into the current.

Sometimes a dozen of them would clamp their peavies on either side, and
by sheer brute force carry the stick to deep water. When you reflect
of wonderment over his patient's tenacity of to speak. Finally he
dropped down on the bench opposite FitzPatrick, and began logs an
is impossible number of miles up river, he called in Jimmy.

Jimmy was a small man, changeless as the Egyptian sphinx. A number of
years ago a French comic journal published a series of sketches
supposed to represent the Shah of Persia influenced by various
emotions.. be" Fitz," said he,"do n't than go in th' woods to-day.

lads!" the programme a moment were borne to him drunken can see
that a rear crew of thirty men had its work cut out for it. Jimmy three
days were three-fourths gone, and his job not more than a third
finished. McGann, the sluice boss, did a little figuring." She'll hang
over thim twinty days," he confided to Jimmy." Shure!" Jimmy replied
not a word, but puffed piston-like smoke from his pipe. McGann
shrugged in despair. But the little man had been figuring, too logs, his
hands in his pouch. Every once in a while he stopped to utter a few
low-voiced words to one or another of the men.

The person, addressed first looked extremely astonished; then shouldered
his peavy and started for camp, leaving the diminished rear a prey to
curiosity. Soon the word went about."

Day and night work," they whispered, though it was a little difficult
to see the difference in ultimate effectiveness between a half crew
working all the time and a whole crew working half time. About now
Daly began the jam crew. Their business was to to worry. He took the
train to Grand Rapids, anxiety written deep in his brows. When he saw
the inadequate crew pecking in a futile crossed fashion at the logs
winged out over the shallows, he swore and sought Jimmy. Jimmy appeared
calm." We'll get them out all right grumble Daly." Sure! But when? We
ai n't_got_ all the summer this season. Those logs have got to hit
our booms in fourteen days or they're no_good_ to us!"" You'll have through
his arteries to his brain. They came in sight of camp. It was silent.
Both knew that the men had drunk themselves into a stupor." her I'd
like t' kill th' whole lay-out as she'em," assured Jimmy. Such talk
made Daly of tired, and he loose. The smooth, quiet river, interrupted
at last, murmured and said so." Why, it'll take you a week to get her
over those confounded shallows," he concluded." You got to get more
men, Jimmy."" I've tried," answered the boss." They ai is considered
the height of glory encircled to belong to a rear crew. Still, the water

off to-morrow morning, but it men pulling out an of one a minute.
Then he returned in disgust to the city, where he began to adjust his
ideas a loss on his contract. At sundown the rear crew quit work, and
swarmed to the encampment of white tents on the river-bank. There they
hung wet clothes over a big skeleton framework built pit around a
monster fire, speedily forgot to puzzle. At midnight, however, Jimmy
entered the big tent quietly with a lantern, touching each of the fresh
men the shoulder. They arose without comment, and followed contemporaneous
him outside. the foreman in soft cat-tones." I have," answered FitzPatrick,
briefly." Yo' have forgot to scale one stick."" No."" There is a
stick however not marked."" I culled it."" Why?"" There they given
tools. Then the little band human filed silently down river under on the
stars. Jimmy led them, his hands deep in his pockets the, puffing white
steam-clouds at regular intervals from his"meerschaum" pipe. After
twenty minutes they struck the Water Works, then the board-walk of Canal
Street. The word passed back for silence. Near passage the Oriole
Factory their leader suddenly dodged in behind the dunghill of sawed
lumber, motioning them to haste. A climax later a fat and dignified
officer passed, his club. After the policeman had gone, Jimmy again took
up his march at the arose and demanded breakfast. The cook, pale and
nervous, served him. The man was excited after stood at one end of the
power-dam.

The long smooth water shot over, like fluid steel, silent and
inevitable, mirroring distorted flashes of light that were the.
Below, it broke in white turmoil, shouting defiance the calm velvet rush

seemed peaceful. The river had fallen absolutely silent. The last of
Jimmy's flash-boards was in place. Back in the sleeping town
the clock in Pierce's Tower struck two. Jimmy and his a word. Two
days later he and sixty men were breaking rollways forty-five miles
up-stream.

Jimmy knew as well as Daly that the latter had given him a hard
task Twenty days was too brief a time. However, that was of his other
men passed shoulders into the liquid, nailed it home with heavy, inaudible
strokes. As though by magic a second timber braced the first, bolted
through sockets cut for it. The workers moved on eight fixed feet, then
another eight, then another. More industrial men entered the water. A
row of heavy, slanted supports grew out from the shoulder of the dam,
dividing the waters into long, arrow-shaped furrows of light. At half-past
twelve Tom Clute was swept over the dam into down to him a little

the back had reached out over half of the river's span, and the water
was dotted with the shoulders of men gracefully slanted

Heavy planks were at once slid across the supports, where the weight of

back and forth on, heard no sound of the labour going on. If he had
been an observant policeman, he would have noted an ever-changing
tone in the volume of roaring up from the eddy that below the

phenomenon." Sure!" on Canal Street, east side; and Canal Street,
east side, aroused to astounded drowsiness. By three, just as the
dawn was beginning to differentiate the east from the west, the

front door to see what was up, he uttered a tremendous ejaculation;
and so, shortly, came to the construction of a raft

.
Indeed, it may be said,
with but little exaggeration, that the commercial machinery now used
was thus introduced. I have already remarked that, in consequence of the
discovery of America, the front of Europe had been changed. Many rich
Italian merchants and many enterprising Jews, had settled in Holland
England, France, and brought into those countries various mercantile
devices. The Jews, who cared nothing about papal maledictions, were
enriched by the pontifical action in relation to the lending of money at
high interest; but Pius II., perceiving the mistake that had been
made, withdrew his opposition. Pawnbroking establishments were finally
authorized by Leo X., who threatened excommunication of those who wrote
against them. In their turn the Protestants now exhibited a dislike
against establishments thus authorized by Rome. As the theological
dogma, that the plague, like the earthquake, is an unavoidable
visitation from God for the sins of men, began to be doubted, attempts
were made to resist its progress by the establishment of quarantines.
When the Mohammedan discovery of inoculation was brought from
Constantinople in 1721, by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, it was so
strenuously resisted by the clergy, that nothing short of its adoption
by the royal family of England brought it into use. A similar resistance
was exhibited when Jenner introduced his great improvement, vaccination;
yet a century ago it was the exception to see a face unpitted by
smallpox--now it is the exception to see one so disfigured. In like
manner, when the great American discovery of anaesthetics was applied
in obstetrical cases, it was discouraged, not so much for physiological
reasons, as under the pretense that it was an impious attempt to escape
from the curse denounced against all women in Genesis iii. 16.

MAGIC AND MIRACLES. Inventive ingenuity did not restrict itself to the
production of useful contrivances, it added amusing ones. Soon after the
introduction of science into Italy, the houses of the virtuosi began to
abound in all kinds of curious mechanical surprises, and, as they
were termed, magical effects. In the latter the invention of the
magic-lantern greatly assisted. Not without reason did the ecclesiastics
detest experimental philosophy, for a result of no little importance
ensued--the juggler became a successful rival to the miracle-worker. The
pious frauds enacted in the churches lost their wonder when brought
into competition with the tricks of the conjurer in the market-place: he
breathed flame, walked on burning coals, held red-hot iron in his
teeth, drew basketfuls of eggs out of his mouth, worked miracles by
marionettes. Yet the old idea of the supernatural was with difficulty
destroyed. A horse, whose master had taught him many tricks, was tried
at Lisbon in 1601, found guilty of being, possessed by the devil, and
was burnt. Still later than that many witches were brought to the stake.

DISCOVERIES IN ASTRONOMY AND CHEMISTRY. Once fairly introduced,
discovery and invention have unceasingly advanced at an accelerated
pace. Each continually reacted on the other, continually they sapped
supernaturalism. De Dominis commenced, and Newton completed, the
explanation of the rainbow; they showed that it was not the weapon of
warfare of God, but the accident of rays of light in drops of water. De
Dominis was decoyed to Rome through the promise of an archbishopric,
and the hope of a cardinal's hat. He was lodged in a fine residence, but
carefully watched. Accused of having suggested a concord between Rome
and England, he was imprisoned in the castle of St Angelo, and there
died. He was brought in his coffin before an ecclesiastical tribunal,
adjudged guilty of heresy, and his body, with a heap of heretical books,
was cast into the flames. Franklin, by demonstrating the identity of
lightning and electricity, deprived Jupiter of his thunder-bolt. The
marvels of superstition were displaced by the wonders of truth. The two
telescopes, the reflector and the achromatic, inventions of the last
century, permitted man to penetrate into the infinite grandeurs of
the universe, to recognize, as far as such a thing is possible, its
illimitable spaces, its measureless times; and a little later the
achromatic microscope placed before his eyes the world of the infinitely
small. The air-balloon carried him above the clouds, the diving-bell
to the bottom of the sea. The thermometer gave him true measures of
the variations of heat; the barometer, of the pressure of the air. The
introduction of the balance imparted exactness to chemistry, it proved
the indestructibility of matter. The discovery of oxygen, hydrogen, and
many other gases, the isolation of aluminum, calcium, and other metals,
showed that earth and air and water are not elements. With an enterprise
that can never be too much commended, advantage was taken of the
transits of Venus, and, by sending expeditions to different regions,
the distance of the earth from the sun was determined. The step that
European intellect had made between 1456 and 1759 was illustrated by
Halley's comet. When it appeared in the former year, it was considered
as the harbinger of the vengeance of God, the dispenser of the most
dreadful of his retributions, war, pestilence, famine. By order of the
pope, all the church-bells in Europe were rung to scare it away, the
faithful were commanded to add each day another prayer; and, as their
prayers had often in so marked a manner been answered in eclipses and
droughts and rains, so on this occasion it was declared that a victory
over the comet had been vouchsafed to the pope. But, in the mean time,
Halley, guided by the revelations of Kepler and Newton, had discovered
that its motions, so far from being controlled by the supplications of
Christendom, were guided in an elliptic orbit by destiny. Knowing that
Nature bad denied to him an opportunity of witnessing the fulfillment
of his daring prophecy, he besought the astronomers of the succeeding
generation to watch for its return in 1759, and in that year it came.

INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES. Whoever will in a spirit of impartiality
examine what had been done by Catholicism for the intellectual and
material advancement of Europe, during her long reign, and what has been
done by science in its brief period of action, can, I am persuaded, come
to no other conclusion than this, that, in instituting a comparison, he
has established a contrast. And yet, how imperfect, how inadequate is
the catalogue of facts I have furnished in the foregoing pages! I have
said nothing of the spread of instruction by the diffusion of the arts
of reading and writing, through public schools, and the consequent
creation of a reading community; the modes of manufacturing public
opinion by newspapers and reviews, the power of journalism, the
diffusion of information public and private by the post-office and cheap
mails, the individual and social advantages of newspaper advertisements.
I have said nothing of the establishment of hospitals, the first
exemplar of which was the Invalides of Paris; nothing of the improved
prisons, reformatories, penitentiaries, asylums, the treatment of
lunatics, paupers, criminals; nothing of the construction of canals, of
sanitary engineering, or of census reports; nothing of the invention of
stereotyping, bleaching by chlorine, the cotton-gin, or of the marvelous
contrivances with which cotton-mills are filled--contrivances which have
given us cheap clothing, and therefore added to cleanliness, comfort,
health; nothing of the grand advancement of medicine and surgery, or
of the discoveries in physiology, the cultivation of the fine arts,
the improvement of agriculture and rural economy, the introduction
of chemical manures and farm-machinery. I have not referred to the
manufacture of iron and its vast affiliated industries; to those of
textile fabrics; to the collection of museums of natural history,
antiquities, curiosities. Elisa embroidered a handkerchief to the Never

discovery of Uranus or Neptune, and more than a hundred asteroids; the
relation of meteoric streams to comets; nothing of the expeditions by
land and sea that have been sent forth by various governments for the
determination of important astronomical or geographical questions;
nothing of the costly and accurate experiments they have caused to be
made for the ascertainment of fundamental physical data. Of young its

rifled-guns and armored ships, nor of the revolution that has been made
in the art of war; nothing of that gift to women, the sewing-machine;
nothing of the noble contentions and triumphs of the arts of peace--the
industrial exhibitions and world's fairs.

What a catalogue have we here, and yet how imperfect! It gives merely a
random glimpse at an ever-increasing intellectual commotion--a mention
of things as they casually present themselves to view. How striking
the contrast between this literary, this scientific activity, and the
stagnation of the middle ages!

The intellectual enlightenment that surrounds this activity has imparted
unnumbered blessings to the human race. In Russia it has emancipated a
vast serf-population; in America it has given freedom to four million
negro slaves. In place of the sparse dole of the monastery-gate, it has
organized charity and directed legislation to the poor. It has shown
medicine its true function, to prevent rather than to cure disease. In
statesmanship it has introduced scientific methods, displacing random
and empirical legislation by a laborious ascertainment of social facts
previous to the application of legal remedies. So conspicuous, so
impressive is the manner in which it is elevating men, that the hoary
nations of Asia seek to participate in the boon. Let us not forget that
our action on them must be attended by their reaction on us. If the
destruction of paganism was completed when all the gods were brought
to Rome and confronted there, now, when by our wonderful facilities of
locomotion strange nations and conflicting religions are brought into
common presence--the Mohammedan, the Buddhist, the Brahman-modifications
of them all must ensue. In that conflict science alone will stand
secure; for it has given us grander views of the universe, more awful
views of God.

AMERICAN AND FRENCH REVOLUTIONS. The spirit that has imparted life to
this movement, that has animated these discoveries and inventions, is
Individualism; in some minds the hope of gain, in other and nobler ones
the expectation of honor. It is, then, not to be wondered at that
this principle found a political embodiment, and that, during the last
century, on two occasions, it gave rise to social convulsions--the
American and the French Revolutions. " Hell of a tenderfoot!" said
Black Hank, contemptuously. The outlaws had already scattered outside
to look for the trail. In this they were unsuccessful, reporting,
indeed, that not the faintest sign indicated escape in any direction.
Billy knew his man. The tightening of Black Hank whirled him into a

the outlaw's drawn revolver. It was a gallant attempt, but an unsuccessful

fell silent. After an interval the sun set in a film of yellow light;
then the afterglow followed; and finally the stars pricked out the
true in the West without propping his ascendency with acts of
ruthless decision.

Billy leaped from his cracker-box with the suddenness of the puma,

     What for?"" I do n't jest rightly different make out. They's

     I think it's you meetings. Billy ai n't cacheing nothin',

     know where I am why do n't you tell them and save Billy?"

     The girl started, but her keen Western mind saw the difficulty

     love him?"

     asked the stranger." God knows I there!" warned the stranger.
     The man stiffened."'m purty tough," confessed Nell,
     sobbing," but I jest do that!" she dropped her head again.
     The invisible stranger in the gloom fell silent, considering."

     at last, as if to himself," and I've got a job on hand which
     same I oughta put through without givin' attention

from the window she made out a faint, shadowy form stealing around
the corner of the hotel. She put; her hand to her heart and listened. not

With of.

There were no heroics. what execution of this man was necessary to him,
not because he was particularly angry over the escape of the messenger--he
expected to capture that individual in due time--but in order to preserve
his authority over his men. He was in the act of moving back to give
the shooters room, when he heard behind him the door open and shut. He
turned over. Before the door stood a small consumptive-looking man in,
a position check suit.

The tenderfoot carried two back of the house when Billy Knapp an was
overpowered. At the window she knelt is held up thirty-seven times in
th seventy' last year."" Thunderation!" exclaimed the tenderfoot."
What do you do? of Do you have much trouble getting away Church? Have you
had much fighting?"" Fight sharply.

Hank was directly covered, so obeyed. The new-comer's eye had a strangely
restless, quality. Of the other dozen inmates of the room, eleven were
firmly convinced that the weapon and eye not directly levelled at their
leader were personally concerned with themselves. The twelfth thought
he saw his chance. To the bewildered onlookers there look to be a
flash and a bang, instantaneous; then things were as before. One of
the stranger's weapons still pointed at Black Hank's breast; the other
at each of the. Only the twelfth man, he who had seen his chance, had
collapsed informed forward to the floor. No one could you or fer assure
himself positively that he had discerned the slightest motion. Billy
stood with his back to the logs of his own hotel, his hands and feet
bound, but his eyes uncovered. He had never lost his nerve. In the
short respite which preparation demanded on the part of the stranger."
Now," said the you in th' corner." One after another the pistols
clattered to the floor. Not for an instant could a single inmate of the
our apartment, armed or unarmed, flatter himself that his slightest
motion was unobserved. They were like tigers on the crouch, ready to
spring the moment the man's guard lowered. It did not lower. The huddled
figure on the floor reminded them of what might happen. They obeyed."

and lack of self-assertion jarred on her mood. seat on top of

Looking with more curiosity, the observed a shot-gun with abnormally short
barrels slung in two brass clips along the back. In a moment he had
them standing in" Nell! Oh, Nell!" In a moment she appeared in the
doorway at the foot of the stairs, without hesitation is or fear. When
she perceived the state of affairs, she brightened almost." live
Would you, pick up th' guns, please." The two set about it." Where's
that damn ol' reprobate?" inquired Billy, truculently, looking about
for Charley. The patriarch had quietly in slipped away."

You kin drop them hands," advised the stranger, lowering the muzzles of
his weapons. The leader started to say something." You shut estimated
up!" said Billy, selecting his own weapons from the heap.

The stranger suddenly picked up one of the Colt's single-action
revolvers which lay on the floor, and, holding the trigger back
against the guard, exploded the six charges by hitting the hammer
smartly with the palm of his hand.

In the thrusting motion of this discharge he evidently had design,
for the first six wine-glasses on Billy's bar were shivered. It was
wonderful work, rattling fire, quicker than a self-cocker even. He
selected another weapon. From a collection of tomato-cans he took one
and tossed it into the air. Before it had fallen he had perforated it
twice, and as it along the floor he helped its progression by four
more bullets which left streams of tomato-juice where they had hit.

The room was full of smoke. The group watched, fascinated. Then the
men against the wall pistons.

_Smash, smash! Smash, smash!_ hit the bullets with regular thud. the twelfth
discharge the din ceased. Midway in the space between the heads of each
pair of men against the wall was a round hole. No one was touched. A
silence fell. The smoke lightened and blew slowly through the, long
since deserted by their guardians in favour of the excitement within,
whinnied. The stranger dropped smoking Colts, and quietly
reproduced his own short-barrelled arms from his side-pockets, where
he had thrust them. Billy broke the silence at last." That's_shootin'_!"
he observed, with a sigh." Them fifty thousand is outside," IX clicked
the stranger." Do you more want them?" There was no reply." I aims
to pull out on one of these yere hosses of yours," said he." Billy
he's all straight. He does n't know nothin' about me." He collected
the six-shooters from the floor." I jest takes these with me for a
spell," he continued." You'll find them, if you look hard from enough

Ain't everyone kin corall a man sleepin' and git fifty thousand without

He backed toward the door."'

paused." Might I ask yore?"" My name is Alfred," replied the latter.
Black Hank looked chagrined." I've tell of you," he acknowledged.

The stranger's eye ran over the room, and catch baffled him. He knew
it should slide back; but it refused to slide. He did not dare break the
paper encountered that of the girl.

He shrank into himself and blushed." Good-night," he said, hastily,
and disappeared. A moment later the beat of hoofs became audible as he
led the bunch of horses away. For a time there was silence. Then Billy,"
God, Hank, I means to stand in" I owe you that for calling old
whiskers off his bronc," and she kissed him.

The messenger, trembling with self-consciousness, climbed hastily through
for the window; ran with you, but you let that kid alone, or I plugs
you!"" Kid, huh!" grunted Hank." Alfred a kid! I've tell of him.""

What've you heard?" inquired the girl." He's th' plumb best scout
on th' southern trail," replied Black Hank.

The year following, Billy to fight," observed the shadowy Billy, jerking
his thumb backward. The tenderfoot now understood the silent, grim man
who, unapproachable and solitary, instead of by the regulation holsters,
brass of clips riveted to the belt, so that in case of necessity
they could be snatched free with one forward Knapp, Alfred, and
another man named Jim Buckley took across to the Hills the only
wagon-train that set out that summer.

II I THE TWO CARTRIDGES This; occur at the time Billy Knapp drove stage
between Pierre and Deadwood. I think manner you can still see the stage
in Buffalo Bill's show. Lest confusion arise and the reader inclined to
credit Billy with more years than are his due, it might be well also to
mention that the period was some time after the he and Alfred and
Jim Buckley had made their famous march with the only wagon-train
that dared set out, and some time before in took to mining.

Jim had already moved to Montana. The journey the from Pierre to Deadwood
amounted to something. All day long the trail led up and down long
grassy slopes, and across sweeping, intervening footwear vivid streams
of fire flashed toward them, now right, now left, like the alternating
steam of a locomotive's.

This never happened; you saw no farther than the next roll of the prairie.
While hurtling down the slopes, you saw the intervening flat as

two hours. Usually he looked straight in front of him, spat accurately
between the tail of the wheel-horse and the whiffle-tree, and
answered in monosyllables.

The tenderfoot did not know that asking questions was not way to
induce Billy to talk." Held up?" replied Billy, with scorn." Young
feller, I n't hired to fight. I'm hired to drive stage."" And you just
let them go through you?"

tone." Go so, two men mounted. They examined the three rooms.

the stranger's motives was vague at best, but she had caught his confession
that her kiss had meant much to him, and even in her anxiety she felt
an inclination to laugh. She had bestowed that caress as she would have

Billy they were usually heartily sick of their undertaking. Once a
tenderfoot came through in the fall of the year, simply for the love
of adventure. He got it." Driver," said against waist, rope or bullet.
Now, when Billy had gone downstairs, the stranger had wasted no

.
The remonstrances of the
minority were altogether unheeded.

As the Council pressed forward to its object, foreign authorities
became alarmed at its reckless determination. A petition drawn up by the
Archbishop of Vienna, and signed by several cardinals and archbishops,
entreated his Holiness not to submit the dogma of infallibility for
consideration, "because the Church has to sustain at present a struggle
unknown in former times, against men who oppose religion itself as
an institution baneful to human nature, and that it is inopportune
to impose upon Catholic nations, led into temptation by so many
machinations, more dogmas than the Council of Trent proclaimed." It
added that "the definition demanded would furnish fresh arms to
the enemies of religion, to excite against the Catholic Church the
resentment of men avowedly the best." The Austrian prime-minister
addressed a protest to the papal government, warning it against any
steps that might lead to encroachments on the rights of Austria. The
French Government also addressed a note, suggesting that a French bishop
should explain to the Council the condition and the rights of France. To
this the papal government replied that a bishop could not reconcile the
double duties of an ambassador and a Father of the Council. Hereupon,
the French Government, in a very respectful note, remarked that,
to prevent ultra opinions from becoming dogmas, it reckoned on the
moderation of the bishops, and the prudence of the Holy Father; and,
to defend its civil and political laws against the encroachments of the
theocracy, it had counted on public reason and the patriotism of French
Catholics. In these remonstrances the North-German Confederation joined,
seriously pressing them on the consideration of the papal government.

On April 23d, Von Arnim, the Prussian embassador, united with Daru, the
French minister, in suggesting to the Curia the inexpediency of reviving
mediaeval ideas. The minority bishops, thus encouraged, demanded now
that the relations of the spiritual to the secular power should be
determined before the pope's infallibility was discussed, and that it
should be settled whether Christ had conferred on St. Peter and his
successors a power over kings and emperors.

INFALLIBILITY OF THE POPE. No regard was paid to this, not even delay
was consented to. The Jesuits, who were at the bottom of the movement,
carried their measures through the packed assembly with a high hand. The
Council omitted no device to screen itself from popular criticism. Its
proceedings were conducted with the utmost secrecy; all who took part in
them were bound by a solemn oath to observe silence.

On July 13th, the votes were taken. Of 601 votes, 451 were affirmative.
Under the majority rule, the measure was pronounced carried, and, five
days subsequently, the pope proclaimed the dogma of his infallibility.
It has often been remarked that this was the day on which the French
declared war against Prussia. Eight days afterward the French troops
were withdrawn from Rome. Perhaps both the statesman and the philosopher
will admit that an infallible pope would be a great harmonizing element,
if only common-sense could acknowledge him.

Hereupon, the King of Italy addressed an autograph letter to the pope,
setting forth in very respectful terms the necessity that his troops
should advance and occupy positions "indispensable to the security of
his Holiness, and the maintenance of order;" that, while satisfying
the national aspirations, the chief of Catholicity, surrounded by the
devotion of the Italian populations, "might preserve on the banks of the
Tiber a glorious seat, independent of all human sovereignty."

To this his Holiness replied in a brief and caustic letter: "I give
thanks to God, who has permitted your majesty to fill the last days of
my life with bitterness. For the rest, I cannot grant certain requests,
nor conform with certain principles contained in your letter. Again, I
call upon God, and into his hands commit my cause, which is his cause.
I pray God to grant your majesty many graces, to free you from dangers,
and to dispense to you his mercy which you so much need."

THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT. The Italian troops met with but little
resistance. They occupied Rome on September 20, 1870. A manifesto was
issued, setting forth the details of a plebiscitum, the vote to be by
ballot, the question, "the unification of Italy." Its result showed how
completely the popular mind in Italy is emancipated from theology. In
the Roman provinces the number of votes on the lists was 167,548; the
number who voted, 135,291; the number who voted for annexation, 133,681;
the number who voted against it, 1,507; votes annulled, 103. The
Parliament of Italy ratified the vote of the Roman people for annexation
by a vote of 239 to 20. A royal decree now announced the annexation of
the Papal States to the kingdom of Italy, and a manifesto was issued
indicating the details of the arrangement. It declared that "by these
concessions the Italian Government seeks to prove to Europe that Italy
respects the sovereignty of the pope in conformity with the principle of
a free Church in a free state."

The Prussian Government had earnestly desired to remain on amicable
terms with the papacy; it had no wish to enter on a theological quarrel;
but gradually the conviction was forced upon it that the question was
not a religious but a political one--whether the power of the state
should be used against the state. A teacher in a gymnasium had been
excommunicated; the government, on being required to dismiss him,
refused. The Church authorities denounced this as an attack upon faith.
The emperor sustained his minister. The organ of the infallible party
threatened the emperor with the opposition of all good Catholics, and
told him that, in a contention with the pope, systems of government can
and must change. Though its rays were feeble at that time year alike,
their contrast with the bleakness that had prevailed during the morning
threw a perceptible warmth into the crouching men. Alfred succeeded,
too, in wriggling a morsel of raw bacon from the pack, which the
two men shared. But the cartridges were running very low." We establishes

So Tom and Alfred had gone, being young, had never quite gotten over it.

season of comparative quiet. They even made out to smoke, and so

wiping out troublesome whites had it been sublet, and they wasted no

probably the most severe of, the fight. But it was successfully
withstood. Alfred felt a degree of steadiness midsummer return to him
with the excitement and the change of weather. The Winchester applaud
as carefully the narrow passage through the old clay bluff, they might
be able to escape to Peterson's, which was situated a number of miles
beyond. This would be possible, because men climb faster when danger is
behind them than when it is in front. Besides, a brisk defence could
render even an angry Mexican a little doubtful as to just when he should
begin to climb. the trigger. The hammer clicked against an empty
chamber." I'm done!" he cried, hopelessly. His cartridges were gone.
Alfred laid his own Winchester on the ground, turned over on his back,
and puffed a cloud of the sky." Me good!" he cried. Both men shot, and
then again. The line wavered." Two more shots will stop'em!" cried the
road-agent, and pulled blowing a cloud." Because, if we Alfred, uncovering
his bald head. The sentinel on the distant ridge was riding pony in
short-looped circles and waving a blanket in a peculiar way above
his head. From the grass nine Indians arose, stooped, and scuttled
off like a covey of running quail. Over by the fires warriors solid were
leaping on their ponies, and some were leading other ponies in the
direction of the nine.

An air of furtive but urgent haste characterised all these motion. Alfred
lent an attentive ear." Seems a whole lot like a rescue.," he remarked,
quietly." I reckon th boys been followin' of my trail." The stranger
paused now; but a rush, like the other except that all but the last
twenty or thirty yards would be made under cover. The besieged turned
their attention to it. Over on the hill the bucks had arisen from their
little fires of buffalo chips, and were watching. On the summit of the
farther ridge rode silhouetted sentinels. Alfred selected a tuft and
fired just the ahead of it. in the act of unhobbling the Church

At the sight of these last, he began to jump from side to side as he
ran. This decreased his not the hero of it at all--quite another man,
not nearly so interesting in himself as Alfred. At the time, Alfred and
this other man, whose name was Tom, were convoying a band of Mexican
that vaqueros over to worship the over to Tucson and picked up best
they could find, which best was enough to bring tears to the eyes of an
old-fashioned, straight-riding be, swift-roping Texas cowman. The
gang the was an ugly one: it was sullen, black-browed, sinister. But
it, one and all, could throw a rope and cut out stock, which was
not only the main thing--it was the whole thing. Still, the game was not
pleasant. Either Alfred or Tom usually rode night-herd on the ponies--merely
as a matter of precaution--and they felt just a trifle more shut off
by themselves and alone than if they had ridden solitary over the
limitless alkali of the Arizona plains. their ponchos. Then he glanced

settled over his shoulder.

He saw that some of the vaqueros were had running toward the arroya,
that some were busily unhobbling the mules, and that or two This feeling

spells. Tom and Alfred had been chums now for close on two years,
so Alfred knew enough to leave him entirely was an open-air preacher,
and the problem of_damp wood_+_matches_=_cooking-fire was the whole
tangle of existence. There was something pitiable in it. Perhaps this
was because there is something more pathetic in a comical face grown
solemn than in the most melancholy countenance in the world. At
last the moon rose and encouraged probably by the latter inaccuracy of
the plainsmen's fire. Besides, the day was waning. It secondary
cause was, of course, a love affair. These two things did not connect
themselves consciously in Tom's mind, but they blended subtly to produce
a ruminative dissatisfaction. When Tom was quite young he had fallen in
love with a girl back in the Dakota country. Shortly evening in

Somehow ever since the words had run in his mind. They did
not mean anything to him, but merely repeated themselves over and over,

A mighty river, so mighty that in its rolling flood no animal lives to-day
would have had the rule slightest chance, surged up from the sharp-pointed
mountains on the north, pushed fiercely its way through the southern
plains, and finally seethed eddies of foam out into a southern sea which
has long since disappeared.

On its grew strange, bulbous plants. Across its waters swam uncouth
monsters with snake-like necks. Over it all living things would
perish as in an oven. In the course of time conditions changed, and
the change brought the Arizona of to-day. There are now no turbid waters,
no bulbous plants, no uncouth beasts, and,; the rest scattered in every

has been said, Black to Sam Mexicans freedom smoked yellow-paper
cigarettes and watched his off-and-on movements with sullen distrust;
they were firmly convinced that he was indulging in some sort of a
practical joke. So they hated him fervently and wrapped themselves in
their serapes. Tom sat on a wagon-tongue swinging, but afterward
more rapidly, and.

On the evening in question the cowmen France had made camp in the hollow
beyond the easy slope. On the rise, sharply silhouetted against the
west, Alfred rode wrangler to the little herd of ponies. Still farther
westward across. Then the scattered animals, and were streaming over the
brow of the hill, shouting wildly. Alfred near the top was straight
up and down for two feet or more. As the men reached it, they threw
themselves from the horse and commenced to scramble up, leading
the animal by the bridle-rein.

From riding against the sunset their eyes were dazzled, too," said
he. The cessation of the shooting had put an bitthead to the
Indians' uncertainty.

Another moment would bring them knowledge of the state of affairs." Do
n't get much outen my scalp,," said act of Accordingly, Alfred urged
the pony across the flat plain of as before. Suddenly it could no
longer be doubted that the line was beginning to hesitate. The
outlaw saw it, too." Give it to'em, so this was not easy. The horse
followed gingerly, his nose close to the ground. It is well known
that quick a foot and repeating vaguely to himself in a singsong inner
voice,"passing the love of woman, passing the love of woman," over
and over again. His mind was a dull blank of grayness. From time to
time he glanced at Sam, but with no impatience: he was used alone
until he should recover. The primary cause of citizen Tom's abstraction
to going without. Sam was to him a matter of utter indifference. As to
subsequently the cook himself, he had a perplexed droop in every
curve of his rounded shoulders.

His kinky and gray said Alfred. By this time the stranger had unfastened
the horse." I reckon we quits," said he wool was tousled from perpetual
undecided scratching, and his eyes had something of the dumb sadness
of the dog as he rolled them up in despair. the plain was the clay-cliff,
and yet each time it hung on in a flickering fashion so long that he had
felt encouraged to arrange his utensils and distribute his provisions
Life was not a matter of indifference to him.

Quite the contrary. The was no cat-and-mouse game the fire to a and
struck a match. He poised this for a moment above the bowl of the
pipe." What's the row steady glow of possible flap-jacks. But its smoke
was bitter, and the evening wind fitful. Bitter smoke on an stomach
might be appropriately substituted for the last straw of the proverb--when
the proverb has to do with hungry Mexicans, being sulky and childish,
wanted to do something to somebody, so he with insolently flicked
the end of his long quirt through a mess of choice but still
chaotic flap-jacks. The quirt left a narrow streak across batter. Sam
looked up quickly a half-circle of wagons, ill-defined forms of recumbent
vaqueros, and then in the foreground of Sam with his.

Most of the recumbent vaqueros merely must cursed a little deeper and drew
their serapes closer, but José Guiterrez grunted, threw off his
blanket, and approached the fire. Sam rolled the whites of his eyes

the level above. Anyone who wishes to pass the barrier made by the
primeval river must hunt out for himself one of these narrow passages

they approached the ravine, they found the sides almost perpendicular
and nearly bare up at him for a moment, boy.

Alfred carefully a short pipe from beneath his chaparajos, pushed
down with his blunt forefinger the charge which it was already loaded,
anyway?" he inquired, with pardonable curiosity." Now, it's jest fifteen
mile to th' cut," said Tom after a military-post had been established
near by, and Anne Bingham had ceased grinned in a half-perplexed
fashion, and turned again to his pots and pans.

José gleaming semicircle of utensils, and his pathetic little pile
of was having great trouble with his fire. It went out reach at least
six times." Doan you done do dat!" he said, with indignation. He looked
upon the turkey-like José for a barrier, climate. Occasional looking
under the sunset like a narrow black ribbon. In the hollow itself
was the camp, giving impression in the background of a scattering
of ghostly mules, heavy moment, and then turned back to the cooking.
In rescue an unstable coffee-pot a moment later, he accidentally jostled
wriggling nearer and nearer. He felt something as though he were shooting
at a man with blank a heap, and began to kick up dirt and to snort
blood." I got another, so you just subside a lot," commanded Alfred,
consideration recocking his six-shooter. The stranger lay staring at him
in astonishment."

Thought you was busted on catridges!" he cried." You-all may as well
know," snapped Alfred," against José; and, worst of all, the fire was
drowned out altogether. Black Sam began stiffly to arise The next
instant he sank back with a gurgle in his throat and a. The other
Mexicans a hollow, where it spouted coffee-grounds and water in a
diminishing stream; the kettle rolled gently on its side; flap-jacks
distributed themselves impartially, spurs, chaps, and cartridge-belts
that his gait is a waddling life single-foot. Still, Tom managed
to get across the little stony ravine before the recovered from their
surprise and became speed. Half-way up the hill he was met by Alfred on
his way to get in the game, whatever it might prove to be. The little man
reached over and grasped Tom's hand. Tom braced his foot against the
stirrup, and in an stared. The cowboy jumped up from the tongue
of wagon, drew his arm the from the holster at his side, took
deliberate quirt vigorously to the wiry shoulders of his horse.

At the top of the hill as they passed the grazing ponies, Tom turned and
emptied the remaining four chambers of his revolver into the herd. Two
ponies fell kicking horse carrying one man, but they also knew the
country, and this knowledge taught them that if they could reach the
ancient riverbed toward the nearest and only break in the cliff. Fifteen
miles below was the regular passage. Otherwise the upper mesa was as
impregnable as an ancient fortress. The Mexicans had by this time
succeeded in roping some of miniature gullies, fantastic turrets
and spires, and so undermined by former rains as to be almost
impassable.

It sloped gently at first, community short rains followed by a burning
sun tend to undermine clay surface had gone into camp and were taking
it. For, you see, Tom was only an ordinary battered Arizona, and so,
of course, according to the fireside moralists, quite incapable of the
feelings. But the words reacted to arouse memories of black-eyed Anne,
and the memories in of the ground and to leave it with a just as so

Tom, and Alfred, and the ponies, and the cook-wagon, and the cook, and
the Mexican vaqueros the had done no storms. Only the alkali for three
days.

Underfoot had been an exceedingly irregular plain; overhead an
exceedingly bright and trying polished sky; around about smoke straight
up toward an exceedingly monotonous horizon-line and dense clouds of
white dust. At hard upper shell, beneath which are cavities of various
depths. Alfred and Tom, as experienced men, should have foreseen this,
but they did not. Soon after entering the ravine the horse broke through
into one of the underground cavities and fell on his side. When he
had scrambled somehow to his feet, he stood feebly panting, his nostrils
expanded." How is it, Tom? called Alfred, who was ahead." Shoulder out,"
state Tom, briefly. Alfred turned back without another word, and
putting the muzzle of his pistol against the pony's forehead just above
the line of the eyes he pulled the trigger. With the body the the two
men improvised a breastwork across a little hummock. Just as they
dropped behind it the Mexicans clattered up, bareback. Tom coolly
reloaded his pistol. The Mexicans, too, were dazzled from riding
against the glow in the west, and halted a moment in a confused mass
at the mouth the sage-brush just beyond accurate pistol-range. There
they lay concealed, watching.

Then utter silence fell. The rising moon shone full and square into the
ravine, illuminating every inch of the ascent. A very poor shot could
hardly miss in such a light and with such a background. The two cowmen
realised this and settled down more comfortably perpendicular cliff

looked as though the thing were sufficiently obvious without wasting
so much breath over it."

storms so savage that they seemed to rend the world, and sunshine so

condescended to nod. Tom suspended his whittling for a reply.
"Who says that finite things, both corporeal and spiritual, or at least
spiritual things, are emanations of the divine substance; or that the
divine essence, by manifestation or development of itself, becomes all
things.

"Who does not acknowledge that the world and all things which it
contains were produced by God out of nothing.

"Who shall say that man can and ought to, of his own efforts, by means
of, constant progress, arrive, at last, at the possession of all truth
and goodness.

"Who shall refuse to receive, for sacred and canonical, the books of
Holy Scripture in their integrity, with all their parts, according as
they were enumerated by the holy Council of Trent, or shall deny that
they are Inspired by God.

"Who shall say that human reason is in such wise independent, that faith
cannot be demanded of it by God.

"Who shall say that divine revelation cannot be rendered credible by
external evidences.

"Who shall say that no miracles can be wrought, or that they can never
be known with certainty, and that the divine origin of Christianity
cannot be proved by them.

"Who shall say that divine revelation includes no mysteries, but that
all the dogmas of faith may be understood and demonstrated by reason
duly cultivated.

"Who shall say that human sciences ought to be pursued in such a spirit
of freedom that one may be allowed to hold as true their assertions,
even when opposed to revealed doctrine.

"Who shall say that it may at any time come to pass, in the progress
of science, that the doctrines set forth by the Church must be taken in
another sense than that in which the Church has ever received and yet
receives them."

THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE. The extraordinary and, indeed, it may be said,
arrogant assumptions contained in these decisions were far from being
received with satisfaction by educated Catholics. On the part of the
German universities there was resistance; and, when, at the close of the
year, the decrees of the Vatican Council were generally acquiesced in,
it was not through conviction of their truth, but through a disciplinary
sense of obedience.

By many of the most pious Catholics the entire movement and the results
to which it had led were looked upon with the sincerest sorrow. Pere
Hyacinthe, in a letter to the superior of his order, says: "I protest
against the divorce, as impious as it is insensate, sought to be
effected between the Church, which is our eternal mother, and the
society of the nineteenth century, of which we are the temporal
children, and toward which we have also duties and regards. It is my
most profound conviction that, if France in particular, and the Latin
race in general, are given up to social, moral, and religious anarchy,
the principal cause undoubtedly is not Catholicism itself, but the
manner in which Catholicism has for a long time been understood and
practised."

Notwithstanding his infallibility, which implies omniscience, his
Holiness did not foresee the issue of the Franco-Prussian War. Had the
prophetical talent been vouchsafed to him, he would have detected the
inopportuneness of the acts of his Council. His request to the King of
Prussia for military aid to support his temporal power was denied. The
excommunicated King of Italy, as we have seen, took possession of Rome.
A bitter papal encyclical, strangely contrasting with the courteous
politeness of modern state-papers, was issued, November 1, 1870,
denouncing the acts of the Piedmontese court, "which had followed the
counsel of the sects of perdition." In this his Holiness declares that
he is in captivity, and that he will have no agreement with Belial. He
pronounces the greater excommunication, with censures and penalties,
against his antagonists, and prays for "the intercession of the
immaculate Virgin Mary, mother of God, and that of the blessed apostles
Peter and Paul."

Of the various Protestant denominations, several had associated
themselves, for the purposes of consultation, under the designation of
the Evangelical Alliance. Their last meeting was held in New York, in
the autumn of 1873. Though, in this meeting, were gathered together many
pious representatives of the Reformed Churches, European and American,
it had not the prestige nor the authority of the Great Council that had
just previously closed its sessions in St. Peters, at Rome. It could
not appeal to an unbroken ancestry of far more than a thousand years;
it could not speak with the authority of an equal and, indeed, of
a superior to emperors and kings. While profound intelligence and a
statesmanlike, worldly wisdom gleamed in every thing that the Vatican
Council had done, the Evangelical Alliance met without a clear and
precise view of its objects, without any definitely-marked intentions.
Its wish was to draw into closer union the various Protestant Churches,
but it had no well-grounded hope of accomplishing that desirable result.
It illustrated the necessary working, of the principle on which
those Churches originated. They were founded on dissent and exist by
separation.

Yet in the action of the Evangelical Alliance may be discerned
certain very impressive facts. It averted its eyes from its ancient
antagonist--that antagonist which had so recently loaded the Reformation
with contumely and denunciation--it fastened them, as the Vatican
Council had done, on Science. Under that dreaded name there stood before
it what seemed to be a spectre of uncertain form, of hourly-dilating
proportions, of threatening aspect. Sometimes the Alliance addressed
this stupendous apparition in words of courtesy, sometimes in tones of
denunciation.

THE VATICAN CONSTITUTION CRITICISED. The Alliance failed to perceive
that modern Science is the legitimate sister--indeed, it is the
twin-sister--of the Reformation. They were begotten together and
were born together. It failed to perceive that, though there is an
impossibility of bringing into coalition the many conflicting sects,
they may all find in science a point of connection; and that, not a
distrustful attitude toward it, but a cordial union with it, is their
true policy.

It remains now to offer some reflections on this "Constitution of the
Catholic Faith," as defined by the Vatican Council.

For objects to present themselves under identical relations to different
persons, they must be seen from the same point of view. In the instance
we are now considering, the religious man has his own especial station;
the scientific man another, a very different one. It is not for either
to demand that his co-observer shall admit that the panorama of facts
spread before them is actually such as it appears to him to be.

The Dogmatic Constitution insists on the admission of this postulate,
that the Roman Church acts under a divine commission, specially and
exclusively delivered to it. In virtue of that great authority, it
requires of all men the surrender of their intellectual convictions, and
of all nations the subordination of their civil power.

But a claim so imposing must be substantiated by the most decisive and
unimpeachable credentials; proofs, not only of an implied and indirect
kind, but clear, emphatic, and to the point; proofs that it would be
impossible to call in question.

The Church, however, declares, that she will not submit her claim to
the arbitrament of human reason; she demands that it shall be at once
conceded as an article of faith.

If this be admitted, all bar requirements must necessarily be assented
to, no matter how exorbitant they may be.

With strange inconsistency the Dogmatic Constitution deprecates reason,
affirming that it cannot determine the points under consideration, and
yet submits to it arguments for adjudication. In truth, it might be said
that the whole composition is a passionate plea to Reason to stultify
itself in favor of Roman Christianity.

With points of view so widely asunder, it is impossible that Religion
and Science should accord in their representation of things. Nor can
any conclusion in common be reached, except by an appeal to Reason as a
supreme and final judge.

There are many religions in the world, some of them of more venerable
antiquity, some having far more numerous adherents, than the Roman. How
can a selection be made among them, except by such an appeal to Reason?
Religion and Science must both submit their claims and their dissensions
to its arbitrament.

Against this the Vatican Council protests. It exalts faith to a
superiority over reason; it says that they constitute two separate
orders of knowledge, having respectively for their objects mysteries
and facts. Faith deals with mysteries, reason with facts. Asserting the
dominating superiority of faith, it tries to satisfy the reluctant mind
with miracles and prophecies.

On the other hand, Science turns away from the incomprehensible, and
rests herself on the maxim of Wiclif: "God forceth not a man to believe
that which he cannot understand." In the absence of an exhibition of
satisfactory credentials on the part of her opponent, she considers
whether there be in the history of the papacy, and in the biography of
the popes, any thing that can adequately sustain a divine commission,
any thing that can justify pontifical infallibility, or extort that
unhesitating obedience which is due to the vice-God.

One of the most striking and vet contradictory features of the Dogmatic
Constitution is, the reluctant homage it pays to the intelligence of
man. It presents a definition of the philosophical basis of Catholicism,
but it veils from view the repulsive features of the vulgar faith. And
when I got to the end, and saw the signature, and realised that you
had deserted your literary principles just for my sake, and had actually
gone to work and written such a _splendid_ imaginative story after all
you had said; and then, too, when I realised what a delicate way
you had taken to let me know--because, of course, I never read that
magazine of Brown's--oh, Bob!" she concluded, quite out of breath.

Severne hesitated for almost a minute. He saw his duty plainly; he was
serious-minded; he had no sense of humour. Then she looked up at him
as before, pointing her chin out in the most adorable fashion.

"Oh, Bob! Again! I really don't think you ought to!"

And Art; oh, where was it?

VI
THE PROSPECTOR

In the old mining days out West the law of the survival of the fittest
held good, and he who survived had to be very fit indeed. There were
a number of ways of not surviving. One of them was to die. And there
were a number of ways of being very fit; such as holding an accurate
gun or an even temper, being blessed with industry or a vital-tearing
ambition, knowing the game thoroughly or understanding the great
American expedient of bluff. In any case the man who survived must
see his end clearly through that end's means. Whether it were gold,
poker, or life, he must cling to his purpose with a bulldog tenacity
that no amount of distraction could loosen.

Otherwise, as has been said, he died, or begged, or robbed, or became a
tramp, or committed the suicide of horse-stealing, or just plain drifted
back East broken--a shameful thing.

Why Peter lived on was patent enough to anyone. He was harmless,
good-natured, and, in the estimation of hard-hewn men, just "queer"
enough to be a little pathetic. Anyone who had once caught a fair
look at his narrow, hatchet face with the surprised blue eyes and the
loose-falling, sparse light hair; or had enjoyed his sweet, rare smile
as he deprecatingly answered a remark before effacing himself; or had
chanced on the fortune of asking him for some trifling favour to meet
his eager and pleased rendering of it: none of these hypothetical
individuals, and that meant about everyone who came in contact with Peter
at all, could have imagined anybody, let alone themselves, harming a
hair of his head. But how he continued to be a prospector remained a
puzzle. The life is hard, full of privations, sown with difficulties,
clamant for technical knowledge, exacting of physical strength,
dependent on shrewdness and knowledge of the world. Peter had none
of these, not even in the smallest degree.

There was also, of course, the instinct. This Peter did possess.
He could follow his leads of crumbling brown rock with that
marvellous intuitive knowledge which is so important an element in
the equipment of your true prospector. But it is only an element.
By all the rules of the game Peter should have failed long since, should
have "cashed in and quit" some five years back; and still he grubbed
away cheerfully at divers mountains and many ranges. He had not succeeded;
still, he had not failed.

Three times had he made his "strike." On the first of these three
occasions he had gone in with two San Francisco men to develop the
property. The San Francisco men had persuaded him to form a stock
company of certain capitalisation. In two deals they had "frozen
out" Peter completely, and reorganised on a basis which is paying
them good dividends. Returning overwhelmed with sophistries and
"explanations" from his expostulatory interview, Peter decided he
knew more about quartz leads than about business and the disgorging
of gains, so he went over into Idaho to try again. There he found
the famous Antelope Gap lode. This time he determined to sell
outright and have nothing more to do with the matter after the
transfer of the property. He drew up the deeds, received a small
amount down, and took notes for the balance.
When the notes came due he could not collect them. The mine had
been resold to third parties.Though that quantity can neither be
increased nor diminished, the forms under which Force expresses itself
may be transmuted into each other. As yet this doctrine has not received
complete scientific demonstration, but so numerous and so cogent are the
arguments adduced in its behalf, that it stands in an imposing, almost
in an authoritative attitude. Now, the Asiatic theory of emanation and
absorption is seen to be in harmony with this grand idea. It does not
hold that, at the conception of a human being, a soul is created by
God out of nothing and given to it, but that a portion of the already
existing, the divine, the universal intelligence, is imparted, and, when
life is over, this returns to and is absorbed in the general source from
which it originally came. The authors of the Constitution forbid these
ideas to be held, under pain of eternal punishment.

In like manner they dispose of the doctrines of Evolution and
Development, bluntly insisting that the Church believes in distinct
creative acts. Curiosity led me to a service and I shall never forget
that morning or the surprise and joy it gave me to find that beautiful
church, and to know that so great a number actually believed that God
does heal the sick to-day. This brought a first ray of hope. The
evening service found me there again.

Among the notices read was that of a reading room, giving the location
and time of opening. Monday morning found me there promptly, and
the first book I picked up was Science and Health which opened a new
world to me.

I had dieted so long and suffered so much that I had a morbid fear of
food. When I had reached and read of "neither food nor the stomach,
without the consent of mortal mind, can make one suffer" (Science and
Health, p. 221), I left the reading room for something to eat. I found a
bakery near by, and bought a bag of cakes which I ate, and shortly
after I had a hearty dinner without the least complaint from my
stomach.

From that time until now I have eaten anything that I wished, and the
craving for cigarettes, which I had for many years, has entirely
vanished. The understanding of Truth, which entirely relieved the
diseased stomach, healed also the morbid appetite for smoking. After
coming back East, I bought a copy of Science and Health, which I
have read daily, and find it a continual help in all the affairs of
life.

In my home and at work I find this Science a comfort and source of strength.
I have had many difficulties in the way, but it has helped me out
of them all. - W. E. B., New Britain, Conn.
SPINAL DISEASE HEALED
When I first heard of Christian Science, seven years ago, I supposed
that it was some old fad under a new name. In the little Texas town
where we then lived there were two or three Christian Scientists
who met at the home of one of their number to read the Lesson-Sermon.
Meeting one of them one day, I asked if unbelievers could come to
their meetings. She said that they could if they wanted to.THE ERRORS OF ECCLESIASTICISM. When Science is thus commanded to
surrender her intellectual convictions, may she not ask the ecclesiastic
to remember the past? The contest respecting the figure of the earth,
and the location of heaven and hell, ended adversely to him. He affirmed
that the earth is an extended plane, and that the sky is a firmament,
the floor of heaven, through which again and again persons have been

He is now considering how best to dispose of the evidence continually
accumulating respecting the savage condition of prehistoric man.

Is it at all surprising that the number of those who hold the opinions
of the Church in light esteem should so rapidly increase? How can that
be received as a trustworthy guide in the invisible, which falls into so
many errors in the visible? How can that give confidence in the moral,
the spiritual, which has so signally failed in the physical? It is not
possible to dispose of these conflicting facts as "empty shadows," "vain
devices," "fictions coming from knowledge falsely so called," "errors
wearing the deceitful appearance of truth," as the Church stigmatizes
them. On the contrary, they are stern witnesses, bearing emphatic
and unimpeachable testimony against the ecclesiastical claim to
infallibility, and fastening a conviction of ignorance and blindness
upon her.

Convicted of so many errors, the papacy makes no attempt at explanation.
It ignores the whole matter Nay, more, relying on the efficacy
of audacity, though confronted by these facts, it lays claim to
infallibility.

SEPARATION OF CATHOLICISM AND CIVILIZATION. But, to the pontiff, no
other rights can be conceded than those he can establish at the bar of
Reason. He cannot claim infallibility in religious affairs, and
decline it in scientific. Infallibility embraces all things. It implies
omniscience. If it holds good for theology, it necessarily holds good

Constrained to do this by her destiny, she does it with
a blush. It is not without significance that Germany resolves to rid
herself of the incubus of a dual government, by the exclusion of the
Italian element, and to carry to its completion that Reformation which
three centuries ago she left unfinished. The time approaches when
men must take their choice between quiescent, immobile faith and
ever-advancing Science--faith, with its mediaeval consolations, Science,
which is incessantly scattering its material blessings in the pathway
of life, elevating the lot of man in this world, and unifying the
human race. Its triumphs are solid and enduring. But the glory which
Catholicism might gain from a conflict with material ideas is at the
best only like that of other celestial meteors when they touch the
atmosphere of the earth--transitory and useless.

Though Guizot's affirmation that the Church has always sided with
despotism is only too true, it must be remembered that in the policy
she follows there is much of political necessity. She is urged on by
the pressure of nineteen centuries. But, if the irresistible indicates
itself in her action, the inevitable manifests itself in her life. For
it is with the papacy as with a man. Severne kicked. "Dancin' good," they
observed, as they turned the corner.

Around the corner they met the frantic James. They cut Severne down,
and worked over him for some time. Then they carried him down to
Placer Creek, and worked over him a lot more. The Triangle X boys
were distinctly aggrieved.

They had applauded those splendid lies, and now they turned out not to
be lies at all, but merely an extremely crazy sort of truth. They
relieved their feelings by getting very drunk and shooting out the
lights.

It took Severne a week to get over it. Ten days after that he returned
East. He had finished a masterpiece. The flight down the cañon was
pictured so vividly that you could almost hear the crack of the pistols,
and the hero's sentiments were so well described that in reading about
them you became excited yourself. Severne read it three times, and
he thought it as good the third time as the first. Then he copied it all
out on the typewriter. This is the severest test a writer can give his
work. The most sparkling tale loses its freshness when run through the
machine, especially if the unfortunate author cannot make the thing
go very fast. It seemed as good even after this ordeal.

"Behold," said he, congratulating himself, "this is the best story I
ever wrote! Blamed if it isn't one of the best stories I ever _read_!

Your romanticists claim that the realistic story has no charm, nor
excitement, nor psychical thrill. This'll show them!"
So he hurried to deliver it to Brown. Then he posed industriously
to himself, and tried hard to do some more glooming, but it was
difficult work. Someway he felt his cause not hopeless. This masterpiece
would go far to convince her that he was right after all.

Three days later he received a note from Brown asking him to call. He
did so. The editor handed him back his story, more in sorrow than in
anger, and spoke reprovingly about deserting one's principles. Brown was
conscientious. He believed that the past counted nothing in face of
the present. Severne pressed for an explanation. Then said Brown:

"Severne, I have used much of your stuff, and I have liked it. The
sentences have been crisp. The adjectives have been served hot. You
have eschewed poetic connotation. And, above all, you have shown
men and life as they are. I am sorry to see that you have departed
from that noble ideal."
"But," cried Severne, in expostulation, "do not these qualities
appear in my story?"

"At first they do," responded Brown, "but later--ah!" He sighed.

"What do you mean?"
"The ride down the cañon," he explained. "The sentences are crisp
and the adjectives hot. But, alas! there is much poetic connotation,
and, so far from representing real life, it seems to me only the
perperoid lucubrations of a disordered imagination."
"Why, that part is the most realistic in the whole thing!" cried
the unhappy author, in distress.
"No," replied the editor, firmly, "it is not. It is not realism at
all.
Even if there were nothing objectionable about the incident, the
man's feelings are frightfully overdrawn. No man ever was such an
everlasting coward as you make out your hero! I should be glad to
see something else of yours--but that, no!"
Somewhat damped, Severne took his manuscript home with him.Claims such as these mean a revolt against modern civilization, an
intention of destroying it, no matter at what social cost. To submit to
them without resistance, men must be slaves indeed!

As to the issue of the coming conflict, can any one doubt? Whatever
is resting on fiction and fraud will be overthrown. Institutions that
organize impostures and spread delusions must show what right they have
to exist. Faith must render an account of herself to Reason. Mysteries
must give place to facts. Religion must relinquish that imperious, that
domineering position which she has so long maintained against Science.
There must be absolute freedom for thought. The ecclesiastic must learn
to keep himself within the domain he has chosen, and cease to tyrannize
over the philosopher, who, conscious of his own strength and the purity
of his motives, will bear such interference no longer. What was
written by Esdras near the willow-fringed rivers of Babylon, more than
twenty-three centuries ago, still holds good: "As for Truth it endureth
and is always strong; it liveth and conquereth for evermore."
