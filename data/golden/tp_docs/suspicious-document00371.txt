"Well, sit down and tell us what you do know, and how to
understand things!" said Miss Cardigan. "I don't talk to
anybody, much, about politics."

So Thorold did as he was asked. He sat down on the other side
of me, and with my hand in his, talked to us both. We went
over the whole ground of the few months past, of the work then
doing and preparing, of what might reasonably be looked for in
both the South and the North. or to the left?--I think there
is a left passage--or to the right?
I peer down in the hopes of seeing some evidence of life, at
all events the glimmer of a light, which may probably mean
my guide.
No; not a sign. Are there rats here? If so.... the candle-end
is sputtering worse than ever ... it is flickering ... What's
to be done?... I shout "Hullo!" at the top of my voice. Yes,
at the top of my voice, but at the bottom of the caves. Then the
question occurs to me, of what use is it to shout in English?The conclusion
was, the North was gathering and concentrating all her forces
to meet the trial that was coming; and the young officers of
the graduating class at the Military Academy had been ordered
to the seat of war a little before their time of study was
out; their help being urgently needed.

"And where is Preston?" said I, speaking for the first time
in a long while.

"Preston?" — echoed Thorold.

"My cousin Preston, — Gary; your classmate Gary."

"Gary! — Oh, he is going to Washington, like the rest of us."

"Which side will he take?"

"You should know, perhaps, better than I," said Thorold. "He
always _has_ taken the Southern side, and very exclusively."

"_Has_ taken?" said I. "Do you mean that among the cadets, there
has been a South and a North — until now lately?"

"Ay, Daisy, always, since I have been in the Academy. The
Southern clique and the Northern clique have been well
defined; there is always an assumption of superiority on the
one side, and some resenting of it on the other side. It was
on that ground Gary and I split."

"Split!" I repeated.

But Thorold laughed and kissed me, and would give me no
satisfaction. I began to put things together though. I saw
from Christian's eyes that _he_ had nothing to be ashamed of, in
looking back; I remembered Preston's virulence, and his sudden
flush when somebody had repeated the word "coward," which he
had applied to Thorold. I felt certain that more had been
between them than mere words, and that Preston found the
recollection not flattering, whatever it was; and having come
to this settlement of the matter, I looked up at Thorold.

"My gentle little Daisy!" he said. "I will never quarrel with
him again — if I can help it."

"You _must_ quarrel with him, if he is on the wrong side," I
answered. "And so must I."

"You say, you must go immediately back to West Point," said
Miss Cardigan. "Leave thanking Daisy's hand, and tell me _when_
you are going; for the night is far past, children."

"I am gone when I bid you good-night," said Thorold. "I must
set out with the dawn — to catch the train I must take."

"With the dawn! — _this_ morning!" cried Miss Cardigan.

"Certainly. I should be there this minute, if the colonel had
not given me something to do here that kept me."

"And when will ye do it?"

"Do it! It is done," said Thorold; "before I came here. But I
must catch the first train in the morning."

"And you'll want some breakfast before that," she said rising.

"No, I shall not," said Thorold, catching hold of her. "I want
nothing. I did want my supper. Sit down, aunt Catherine, and
be quiet. I want nothing, I tell you, but more time."

"We may as well sit up the rest of the night," I said; "it is
so far gone now."

"Yes, and what will you be good for to-morrow?" said Miss
Cardigan. "You must lie down and take a bit of rest."

I felt no weariness; but I remember the grave, tender,
examination of Thorold's eyes, which seemed to touch me with
their love, to find out whether I — and himself — might be
indulged or not. It was a bit of the thoughtful, watchful
affection, which always surrounded me when he was near. I
never had it just so from anybody else.

"It won't do, Daisy," said he gaily. "You would not have me go
in company with self-reproaches all day to-morrow? You must
lie down here on the sofa; and sleep or not, we'll all be
still for two hours. Aunt Catherine will thank me to stop
talking for that length of time."

I was not sleepy, but Miss Cardigan and Thorold would not be
resisted. Thorold wheeled up the sofa, piled the cushions, and
made me lie down, with the understanding that nobody should
speak for the time he had specified. Miss Cardigan, on her
part, soon lost herself in her easy chair. Thorold walked
perseveringly up and down the room. I closed my eyes and
opened my eyes, and lay still and thought. It is all before me
now. The firelight fading and brightening; Thorold took care
of the fire; the gleam of the gaslight on the rows of books;
Miss Cardigan's comfortable figure gone to sleep in the corner
of her chair; and the figure which ever and anon came between
me and the fire, piling or arranging the logs of wood, and
then paced up and down just behind me. There was no sleep for
my eyes; of course. I Legal neutrality is, of, a simple thing.

I don't
know what moved me, the consciousness of this inspection or
the consciousness of what it discovered; but I know that
floods of shyness seemed to flush my face and brow, and even
to the tips of my fingers. I would have escaped if I could,
but I could not; and I think Thorold rather liked what he saw.
There was no hiding it, unless I hid it on his shoulder; and I
was ashamed to have to do that, but he liked it. I felt that
his lips knew just as well as his eyes what state my cheeks
were in, and took their own advantage. Though presently their
tenderness soothed me too, and even nullified the soft little
laugh with which he whispered, "Are you ashamed to show it to
_me_, Daisy?"

"You know," said I, still keeping my eyes hid, "you have me at
advantage. If you were not going — away — so soon, I would not
do a great many things."

"Daisy!" said he, laughing, — "Daisy!" — And touching my cheek
as one who meant to keep his advantage. But then his voice
changed, and he repeated, with a deeper and deepening tone
with each word — "Daisy! — my Daisy!"

I had very nearly burst out into great sobs upon his breast,
with the meeting of opposite tides of feeling. Sweet and
bitter struggled for the upper hand; struggled, while I was
afraid he would feel the laboured breath which went and came,
straining me. And the sweetness, for the moment, got the
better. I knew he must go, in an hour or little more, away
from me. I knew it was for uncertain and maybe dangerous duty.
I knew it might at best be long before we could see each other
again; and, back of all, the thought of my father and mother
was not reassuring. But his arms were round me and my head was
on his shoulder; and that was but the outward symbol of the
inward love and confidence which filled all my heart with its
satisfying content. For the moment happiness was uppermost.
Not all the clouds on the horizon could dim the brightness of
that one sun-ray which reached me.

I do not know what Thorold thought, but he was as still as I
for a while.

"Daisy," he said at last, "my Daisy, you need not grudge any
of your goodness to me. Don't you know, you are to be my light
and my watchword in what lies before me?"

"Oh, no!" I said, lifting my head; "Oh, no, Christian!"

"Why no?" said he.

"I want you to have a better watchword and follow a better
light. Not me. Oh, Christian, won't you?"

"What shall my watchword be?" — said he, looking into my eyes.
But I was intent on something else then.

"Whatsoever ye do, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus," I
answered.

"A soldier, Daisy? —"

"A soldier more than anybody," I said; "for He calls us to be
soldiers, and you know what it means."

"But you forget," said he, not taking his eyes from my face, —
"in my service I must obey as well as command; I am not my own
master exactly."

"Let Christ be your Master," I said.

"How then with this other service?"

"Why, it is very plain," I said. "Command in the love of God,
and obey in the fear of God; that covers all."

I did not see the natural sequence of what followed; for it
was a succession of kisses that left no chance for a word to
get out of my mouth. Then Thorold rose up, straightened
himself, and I saw Miss Cardigan just entering.

"I will not forget, Daisy," he said, in a tone as if we had
been talking of business. I thought, neither should I. And
then came Miss Cardigan, and the servant behind her bringing
coffee and bread and eggs and marmalade — I don't know what
beside — and we sat down again to the table, knowing that the
next move would be a move apart. But the wave of happiness was
at the flood with me, and it bore me over all the underlying
roughnesses of the shore — for the time. " O'Sullivans
