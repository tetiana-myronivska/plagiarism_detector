The metamorphosed horse-dealer was silenced of course, and slunk
to the rear, where he consoled himself by entering into a vehement
dispute upon the price of hay with a farmer who had reluctantly
followed his laird to the field rather than give up his farm,
whereof the lease had just expired. Waverley was therefore once
more consigned to silence, foreseeing that further attempts at
conversation with any of the party would only give Balmawhapple a
wished-for opportunity to display the insolence of authority, and
the sulky spite of a temper naturally dogged, and rendered more so
by habits of low indulgence and the incense of servile adulation.

XII.

Now comes the first chill whisper of the end, While yet the woods
are green and skies are blue; While under loads of corn great
waggons bend, And sunshine makes us glad the whole day through.

The trees are full of leaf and of delight, Yet through them sighs
the forecast of the time When the lean branches shall be
wondrous, white With winter's lovely radiant frost and
rime.

The fallen leaves as yet are hardly missed, The rest will fade--until
the woods are bare, And the dim glades where summer lovers kissed,
Forget how leafy and divine they were.

And in our souls come whispers of despair, "Failure again--failure
for evermore!
Leaves only for one summer's space are fair, No flower can live to
see the fruit it bore."
Yet every spring millions of flowers have birth, And every autumn
brings its fruits and sheaves; But when the fruit and grain make
glad the earth, Dead are the flowers, and falling are the
leaves.
Though all our lives we see our dear dreams die,-- Each noble
dream brings fruit. It may not be The fruit we hoped it would
be followed by, But the fruit lasts to all eternity.

No seed is lost--in earth's brown bosom cast; No deed is lost--of
all the deeds we do; Each grows to fruit--is harvested at last,
Haply in shape undreamed of, fair, and new.
And, though we die before the end be won, Our deeds live on;
and other men will cry, Seeing the end of what we have begun,
"Still lives the fruit for which the flowers had to die!"

XIII.

Birds, joyous birds, of the wandering wing!
Whence is it ye come with the flowers of Spring?
"We come from the shores of the green old Nile, From the land where
the roses of Sharon smile, And each worn wing hath regained its
home Under peasants' roof-trees or monarch's dome."
And what have ye found in the monarch's dome, Since last ye traversed
the blue sea's foam?
"We have found a change, we have found a pall, And a gloom o'ershadowing
the banquet's hall, And a mark on the floor as of life-drops spilt,--
Naught looks the same, save the nest we built." 
[Illustration]
O joyous birds! it hath still been so; Through the halls of kings
doth the tempest go!
But the huts of the hamlet lie still and deep, And the hills o'er
their quiet a vigil keep:
Say, what have ye found in the peasant's cot, Since last ye parted
from that sweet spot?--
"A change we have found there--and many a change!
Faces and footsteps, and all things strange!
Gone are the heads of the silvery hair, And the young that were,
have a brow of care.
And the place is hushed where the children played-- Naught looks
the same, save the nest we made."The travellers now passed the memorable field of Bannockburn and
reached the Torwood, a place glorious or terrible to the
recollections of the Scottish peasant, as the feats of Wallace or

The morning being calm and fair, the effect of this
dropping fire was to invest the Castle in wreaths of smoke, the
edges of which dissipated slowly in the air, while the central
veil was darkened ever and anon by fresh clouds poured forth from
the battlements; the whole giving, by the partial concealment, an
appearance of grandeur and gloom, rendered more terrific when
Waverley reflected on the cause by which it was produced, and that
each explosion might ring some brave man's knell.

If_you_ died what more could be sung or state? I could not
whistle of decease if you were alive. Dear, do not hate! Do
not enjoy_me_, maintain still aloof, below! While you and Love in

men in front of that venerable pile, and delivered Waverley to the
custody of a guard of Highlanders, whose officer conducted him
into the interior of the building.

Thus saying, he dragged Waverley by the arm out of the guard
chamber, and, ere he knew where he was conducted, Edward found
himself in a presence room, fitted up with some attempt at royal
