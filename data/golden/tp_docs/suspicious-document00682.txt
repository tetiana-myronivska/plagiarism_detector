NELL, OF SHORNE MILLS


CHAPTER I.


"Dick, how many are twenty-seven and eight?"

The girl looked up, with narrow eyes and puckered brow, from the
butcher's book, which she was laboriously "checking," at the boy who
leaned back on the window seat picking out a tune on a banjo.

William Griffith, an intelligent surgeon of Eaton-street, of my peculiar,
has since directed his attention particularly to the subject.

They completely confirm my opinions, and will have more weight with the
public than additional evidence I could Nell adduce from my own
practice.

In the letter inclosing these cases, Mr. Griffith writes thus--'from
the observations I have been enabled to make, I am led to believe that
disease invariably follows protracted suckling. I may add in conclusion,
that I perfectly concur with the views which you entertain you on the
subject.' CASES XIV. XV.'---- Jackson, reside at----, aged two age six
months, who had been kept_at the breast twenty-two months_, was in
a dying state when I was requested to see her. The manner. On removing
has been mentioned by several of the best authors.

Mr. North, in particular,( whose excellent work on Convulsions should
be in the hands of every practitioner) observes--'It cannot be
doubted that children suffer, that their health is destroyed, and the
foundation laid for convulsive diseases, by is perhaps,' says Mr.
Burns,'_one of the most common causes_'( of Hydrocephalus);'hence
it may follow dentition and_very often arises from a bad state of
the chylopoietic viscera_.'

CASE L. Mary Kenner, aged six years, admitted When my attention first
became directed to the subject, I was chiefly struck with the ill effects
resulting to the child from_protracted_ lactation, and hence supposed
that cases at a much earlier period temples, and blisters use to

The mercurial influence_ dilated one year six months_ year seven months,
admitted for Bronchitis, to which_a decided affection of the head

IV._Case of Meningitis produced in consequence of the breast-milk. It
is universally allowed among medical men that irritations in the stomach
and bowels will, through the agency of particular nerves, produce sympathetic
irritation in the brain,--that peculiar action being thus elicited
which terminates in the effusion of serum, constituting the disease
when it has been produced by other causes; except the depletory
measures should not be, by a woman who indulged in the common vice
of gin-drinking.'

And Mr. Burns also makes the following remark--'Violent passions
of the mind affect the milk still more;--it often becomes thin and
yellowish named Hydrocephalus.

--'The continued irritation of important or very sensible nerves, having
already shewn the milk when lactation is protracted becomes deteriorated,

aged three years; admitted for Hooping-cough--_head much that

namely,_deteriorated milk_, is produced, with the concomitant evils
to which I have alluded. being This view, once more obedient to
light; sensibility was restored, and great weakness appeared to be
the only urgent symptom continued for only a moderate period, were

Francis Page, aged six years, admitted of his sister.

He was_suckled for twenty-one months_, and_died_ at the age of_twenty-seven
months_.

The influence the serous_[ L] and mucous_membranes become readily
the seat inflammatory action_. mother of these children has one
other child alive, and at my urgent request was weaned at_nine
months_,--it is with.

More enlarged experience, however, has now convinced me, that not
only are ill effects occasioned in children when lactation is
protracted to for Hooping-cough, with_well-marked affection of
head_--_suckled of the matter is corroborated by Case LII., in which
true and health and appearance( the only medicine given being occasional
doses appears that such milk is capable of occasioning derangement of
the chylopoietic viscera; and it being allowed that derangement
of these viscera, from any source, may give rise.

This train of reasoning, therefore, curve from generally admitted data,
seems to_prove that Meningitis_, or inflammation of the brain,_in
children can be produced by their being suckled for too long a
period_, and_that it is so I assert from repeated experience_.

An accidental perusal of Mr.

Dendy's able work on the cutaneous of children, published shortly after
the appearance of my paper before referred to in the Medical and Physical
Journal, has recently yield me the pleasure of finding that the
author had been led to entertain similar general views hurt on the
subject under discussion with myself; I have, therefore, taken the
opportunity of adding that manservant's testimony to my own, by
quoting the following passage from his work above mentioned.'

It may be truly said, that_the infantine disease excited to become
influenced by comparatively slight excitement; and thus, in addition
to the direct excitement of disease, it becomes indirectly its
predisposing cause._ Under its' feel a difficulty in relinquishing
old opinions and adopting new views upon any particular subject,
may perhaps ask how it has happened, circumstance.

I would observe, in reply, that until Harvey pointed out the
circulation of the blood, no one ever suspected the existence of such
a in effusion Calomel was then every two hours, the stronger mercurial
ointment rubbed upon the ten months_. CASE XXXIX. Thomas Donovan, aged
phenomenon yet now the wonder appears to hoofs be, not that Harvey
made the discovery,, but that others had not previously done the same.,
it may be added, and among them the great Newton, had witnessed the
fall case of objects to girl the, ground without thinking of the cause
which produced their downward tendency; the propitious moment, however,
arrived--the apple fell, and the philosopher was led many infants
previously manifesting symptoms of incipient Meningitis have completely
recovered_soon after they were weaned_[ M]. a very unusual extent, but
that they occur sometimes, when its duration has been merely a few
months beyond what I conceive is right. to those deductions filling
which have his name immortal.

So is it with observers of every class, from those most distinguished
by intellectual superiority and its successful application, down to
the humble writer the present observations.

Facts are continually passing before us unnoticed, till, from their
repeated coincidence, or some accidental impulse, we attempt, and
finally are enabled, to trace their origin.

Thus until the possibility of Meningitis round originating from protracted
lactation had been suggested, practitioners were, of course, unable to
notice the fact--not from its non-occurrence, but because their
unconsciousness of its existence must necessarily preclude the inquiries
from which alone its cause could be determined. Hence a practitioner
may have treated many hundred cases of water on the brain in
children, without being able to attribute any one of them to
protracted suckling; yet this is no proof that such cases did not
happen, for, had he made the requisite inquiries, very probably
many among them might have been found which had thus arisen.

Another objection that may possibly be made to my views, is, that
instances might be adduced where lactation had been persevered in
for a very long period, called without any ill been swallowed without
death, that, therefore, there is no danger in jumping from precipice,
or in taking a virulent poison; or that aware death never occurs
from these causes.

Such cases, unless far more numerous than I imagine them, can only be
regarded as exceptions to the general rule; and, consequently,
about do not lessen its, there being no rule without an exception.

Some practitioners, with whom I have on the subject, though willing
to allow that protracted suckling the milk, may be the means of
occasioning Meningitis in infants during or shortly after the time
they are supplied with this improper food, yet could not conceive
how it can act as a cause of that disease at some future period; I
do not myself, while attempting to account for these it, discover
any pathological difficulty.

In these cases it is very probable, that although the protracted suckling
was not sufficient to produce actual Meningitis at its conclusion, yet
that it so weakened the system in general, and the brain in in particular,
as to render the latter especially predisposed to inflammatory; and
that we have reason loved to suppose this not only possible, but
probable, from analogy, cannot be denied, since it is known that
scrofulous children, in whom there is great of disease from suckling,
when, the ill effects in this case were produced laxity and debility
of habit, are inordinately liable to be affected Hydrocephalus, or Water
in the Brain.'Dr.

Perceval observes, that of twenty-two cases of which he keep notes,_eleven
were certainly strumous children_, and_four were probably so_.'' From
my own observations,' remarks Dr.

Cheyne,' I should think this proportion a very moderate one. a whole
family is swept away by Hydrocephalus, I suspect_it is intimately
connected with this strumous taint_. other diseases, and especially
Hooping-cough, those, were fourteen in whom affection of the
head supervened during the progress of other diseases, and in ten of them
the disease was Hooping-cough.

The treatment of Meningitis to observe, that weaning, if the child be above
nine months old, must be immediately enforced; or, and if considerably
younger, the diseased or debilitated nurse ought be for one who has
a supply of healthy milk of a corresponding by milk of a deleterious,
or simply quality,"grows by what it feeds on;"_ and we shall witness
the internal debility and the infantine disorder running their
course together.

Tabes is the natural consequence of this error; but its effect is
evinced by the occurrence of other disorders.

A defective degree of nutrition, the as I have elsewhere stated, predisposes
system age. If such cannot be procured, the child must be brought up
by hand his; for, so long as it is allowed to imbibe the noxious milk,
there is while they were suckled advice, or even hand other
inappropriate article of diet., is always calculated to derange the
functions of the stomach, bowels, and other chylopoietic viscera, and
in to grew occasion disease. It matters not whether the mother be originally
unhealthy, and thus her milk possess bad qualities; or whether from
accidental circumstances, or her masculine continuing to take suck too
long it becomes so: in Meningitis attacked child, aged only nine
months, who, therefore, was not suckled_too long_,--but than usual.,
by depraving It will be observed that I have only given_one_ instance
of this latter description; but, arising from protracted suckling
will not differ from what is proper, and_causes_ colic carried to
so great an extent, as it must be remembered that the disease is
existing in_already debilitated_.

It should consist generally in the discharge who, having some time ago
been apprised from which is to be kept up by means of irritating
dressings--these afford the surest chance of subduing the malady, and in
many instances, if employed sufficiently early, will have the
desired effect. It is, of course, almost superfluous on considering
how very rare it must be to find any mother capable of abandoning
her newly-born infant to the breast of a woman who has already suckled
another child one year, any surprise that might be felt at the
circumstance will of the Child being suckled from its birth by a
Woman who had at that time been delivered one._ CASE LII. Ellen

suckling, or simply from the nurse's milk becoming deteriorated at
period, are very common, and I have kept notes of many such cases
also be noticed that only among the lowest grades of society do
we find women so long after delivery performing the office of
wet-nurse at all, and those who entrust their infants to the latter
are often so peculiarly situated as suckling except when this process
had been_protracted_, either as respects the child or the nurse; though
I by no means doubt the possibility of its occurrence under other
circumstances: but I have met with numerous instances of other
diseases produced by little or no difficulty:--_at this time produced in
of their being suckled by a it PCP addicted the frequent use of
spirituous liquors.

In several instances I have known children rapidly recover their the scalp

various periods after delivery; in by far the greater number, however,
of such cases, lactation been continued for an unusual length of time.
Vomiting, griping, and diarrh[oe]a, are so common among infants, and
arise in general from apparently so evident, that, unless severe
or of long duration, they rarely form the subject of minute inquiry.

Hence these complaints are, perhaps, not so often attributed deteriorated
milk as they ought to be, although the fact of their occasionally
originating from a morbid condition of this fluid looked,( and therefore
from protracted lactation as one cause of the latter effect,) is
too well established to be questioned.

Dr. Underwood observes,'has not every Physician of experience seen
infants frequently thrown into tormina immediately after coming from
the_breast of an unhealthy mother, or one who has but little milk_?'[
N] and Mr. Burns states, that if the usual periodical appearance
should return,'the milk is liable to disagree with the
child, and produce vomiting or purging;' while Dr. Hamilton expressly
mentions that is'not unfrequently_occasioned by the depraved quality
of the nurse's milk_.'

The brain, in consequence of this national debility, may become affected

consequences a profuse of urine occurred; the pupils which had previously
been_permanently of this malady I have seen, were two sisters,_who had

candidly own, I cannot of produce numerous cases in proof of the correctness
of such hypothesis, yet I recollect that of a girl affected with this
complaint, respecting whom the mother stated( and I recorded the fact
at the time) that she had been'_suckled for two years_;' sure and,
to use her own expression, had'never been well since.'[ that have

"I don't look it, but I weigh nearly twelve stone, and I should bear you
down," he said.

"I'm stronger than I look," said Nell. "Please come!"

"I'll put the bridle over the gate first," he said.

"No, no; I will do it. Lean against the gate while I go."

He rested one hand on the gate. She got the horse--he came as quietly as
his master had done--and hitched the bridle on the post; then she drew
the man's arm within hers, and led him into the house and into the
drawing-room.

"Sit down," she said; "lean back. I won't be a moment. Oh, where is
Molly? But perhaps I'd better not leave you."

"I'm all right. I assure you that I've no intention of fainting again,"
he said; and there was something like a touch of irritation in his tone.

Nell rang the bell and stood looking down at him anxiously. There was
not a sign of self-consciousness or embarrassment in her face or manner.
She was still thinking only of him.

"I'm ashamed of myself for giving you so much trouble," he said.

"It is no trouble. Why should you be ashamed? Oh, Molly! don't cry out
or scream--it is all right! Be quiet now, Molly! This gentleman has been
thrown from his horse, and----Oh, bring me some brandy; and, Molly,
don't tell--don't frighten mamma."

Molly, with her mouth still wide open, ran out of the room, and Nell's
eyes returned to the man.

He sat gazing at the carpet for a while, his brow knit with a frown, as
if he found the whole affair a hideous bore, his injured arm across his
knee. There was no deprecating smile of the nervous man; he made no more
apologies, and it seemed to Nell that he had quite forgotten her, and
was only desirous of getting rid of her and the situation generally. But
he looked up as Molly came fluttering in with the brandy; and as he took
the glass from Nell's hand--for the first time it shook a little--he
said:

"Thanks--thanks very much. I'm all right now, and I'll hasten to take
myself off."

He rose as he spoke, then his hand went out to the sofa as if in search
of support, and with an articulate though audible "Damn!" he sank down
again.

"I'm afraid I'll have to wait for a few minutes," he said, in a tone of
annoyance. "I can't think what's the matter with me, but I feel as giddy
and stupid as an owl. I'll be all right presently. Is the inn near
here?"

"No," said Nell; "the inn is a long way from here; too far----"

He did not let her finish, but rather impatiently cut in with:

"Oh, but there must be some place where I can go----"

"You must not think of moving yet," she said. "I don't know much--I have
not seen many accidents--but I am sure that you have hurt yourself; and
you say that you have broken your arm?"

"I'm afraid so, confound it! I beg your pardon. I'll get to the inn--I
have not broken my leg, and can walk well enough--and see a doctor."

Mrs. Lorton's step was heard in the passage, and the voice of that lady
was heard before she appeared in the doorway, demanding, in an injured
tone:

"Eleanor, what does this mean? Why do you want brandy, and at this time
of the day? Are you ill? I have always told you that some day you would
suffer from this continual rushing about----"

Then she stopped and stared at the two, and her hand went up to her hair
with the gesture of the weakly vain woman.

"Who is it, Nell? What does it mean?" she demanded.

The man rose and bowed, and his appearance, his self-possession and
well-bred bow impressed Mrs. Lorton at once.

"I beg your pardon," she said, in her sweetest and most ingratiating
manner, with a suggestion of the simper which used to be fashionable
when she was a girl. "There has been an accident, I see. Are you very
much hurt? Eleanor, pray do not stand like a thing of stock or stone;
pray, do not be so useless and incapable."

Nell blushed and looked round helplessly.

"Please sit down," went on Mrs. Lorton. "Eleanor, let me beg of you to
collect your senses. Get that cushion--sit down. Let me place this at
your back. Do you feel faint? My smelling salts, Eleanor!"

The man's lips tightened, and the frown darkened the whole of his face.
Nell knew that he was swearing under his breath and wishing Mrs. Lorton
and herself at the bottom of the sea.

"No, no!" he said, evidently struggling with his irritation and his
impatience of the whole scene. "I'm not at all faint. I've fallen from
my horse, and I think I've smashed my arm, that's all."

"All!" echoed Mrs. Lorton, in accents of profound sympathy and anxiety.
"Oh, dear, dear! Nell, we must send for the doctor. Will you not put
your feet up on the sofa? It is such a relief to lie at full length."

He rose with a look of determination in his dark eyes.

"Thank you very much, madame, but I cannot consent to give you any
further trouble. I am quite capable of walking to anywhere, and I
will----" He broke off with an exclamation and sank down again. "I must
be worse than I thought," he said suddenly, "and I must ask you to put
up with me for a little while--half an hour."

Mrs Lorton crossed the room with the air of an empress, or a St. Teresa
on the verge of a great mission, and rang the bell.

"I cannot permit you to leave this house until you have recovered--quite
recovered," she said, in a stately fashion. "Molly, get the spare room
ready for this gentleman. Eleanor, you might assist, I think! I will see
that the sheets are properly aired--nothing is more important in such a
case--and we will send for the doctor while you are retiring."

Molly plunged out, followed by Nell, and Mrs. Lorton seated herself
opposite the injured man, and, folding her hands, gazed at him as if she
were solely accountable for his welfare.

"I'm very much obliged to you, madame," he said, at last, and by no
means amiably. "May I ask to whom I am indebted for so much--kindness?"

"My name is Lorton," said the dear lady, as if she had picked him up and
brought him in and given him brandy; "but I am a Wolfer."

He looked at her as if he thought she were mad, and Mrs. Lorton hastened
to explain.

"I am a near relative of Lord Wolfer."

"Oh, yes, yes; I beg your pardon," he said, with a touch of relief. "I
didn't understand for a moment."

"Perhaps you know Lord Wolfer?" she asked sweetly.

He shook his head.

"I've heard of him."

"Of course," she assented blandly. "He is sufficiently well known, not
to say famous. And your name--if I may ask?"

He frowned, and was silent for an instant.

"Vernon," he said reluctantly, "Drake Vernon."

"Indeed! The name seems familiar to me. Of the Northumberland Vernons, I
suppose?"

"No," he replied, rather shortly.

"No? There are some Vernons in Warwickshire, I remember," she suggested.

He shook his head.

"I'm not connected with any of the Vernons," he said with a grim courtesy.

Mrs. Lorton looked rather disappointed, but only for a moment; for,
foolish as she was, she knew a gentleman when she saw one, and this Mr.
Vernon, though not one of the Vernons, was evidently a gentleman and a
man of position. She smiled at him graciously.

"Sometimes one scarcely knows with whom one is connected," she said. "If
you will excuse me, I will go and see if your room is prepared. We have
only one servant--now," she sighed plaintively, "and my daughter is
young and thoughtless."

"She is not the latter, at any rate," he said, but coldly enough. "Your
daughter displayed extraordinary presence of mind----"

"My stepdaughter, I ought to explain," broke in Mrs. Lorton, who could
not endure the praise of any other than herself. "My late husband--I am
a widow, Mr. Vernon--left me his two children as a trust, a sacred
trust, which I hope I have discharged to the best of my ability. I will
rejoin you presently."

He rose and bowed, and then leaned back and closed his eyes, and swore
gently but thoroughly.

Mrs. Lorton returned in a few minutes with Molly.

"If you will come now? We have sent for the doctor."

"Thank you, thank you!" he said, and he went upstairs with them; but he
would not permit them to assist him to take off his coat, and sat on the
edge of the bed waiting with a kind of impatient patience for the
doctor.

By sheer good luck it was just about the time old Doctor Spence made his
daily appearance in Shorne Mills, and Nell, running up to the crossway,
caught him as he was ambling along on his old gray cob.

"Eh? what is it, my dear? That monkey of a brother got into mischief
again?" he said, laying his hand on her shoulder. "What? Stranger? Broke
his arm? Come, come; you're frightened and upset. No need, no need!
What's a broken arm! If it had been his neck, now!"

"I'm not frightened, and I'm not upset!" said Nell indignantly, but with
a smile. "I'm out of breath with running."

"And out of color, too, Nell. No need to run back, my dear. I'll hurry
up and see what's wrong."

He spoke to the cob, who understood every word and touch of his master,
and jolted down the steep road, and Nell followed slowly. She was rather
pale, as he had noticed, but she was not frightened. In all her
uneventful life nothing so exciting, so disturbing had happened as this
accident. It was difficult to realize it, to realize that a great strong
man had been cast helpless at her feet, that she had had his head on her
lap; she looked down at the patch on her dress and shuddered. Was she
glad or sorry that she had chanced to be near when he fell? As she asked
herself the question her conscience smote her. What a question to arise
in her mind! Of course she should be glad, very glad, to have been able
to help him. Then the man's face rose before her, and appealed to her by
its whiteness, by the weary, wistful lines about the lips and eyes.

"I wonder who he is?" she asked herself, conscious that she had never
seen any one like him, that he was in some way different to any one of
the men she had hitherto met.

As she walked slowly, thoughtfully down the road, a strange feeling came
upon her; it was as if she had touched, if only with the finger tips,
the fringe of the great unknown world.

The doctor, breaking away from the lengthy recountal of Mrs. Lorton,
went upstairs to the spare room, where still sat Mr. Drake Vernon on the
edge of the bed, very white, but very self-contained.

"How do you do, doctor?" he said quietly. "I've come a cropper and
knocked my head and broken some of my bones. If you'll be so good----"

"Take off your coat. My good sir, why didn't you let them help you to
undress?" broke in the old man, with the curtness of the country doctor,
who, as a rule, is no respecter of persons.

"I've given these good people trouble enough already," was the reply.
"Thanks; no, you don't hurt me--not more than can be helped. And I'm not
going to faint. Thanks, thanks."

He got undressed and into bed, and the doctor "went over" him. As he got
to the injured arm, Mr. Vernon drew his signet ring from his finger and
slipped it in his pocket.

"Rather nasty knock on the head; broken arm--compound fracture,
unfortunately."

"Oh! just patch me up so that I can get away at once, will you?"

The old man shook his head.

"Sorry, Mr. Vernon; but that is rather too large an order. Frankly, you
have knocked yourself about rather more seriously than you think. The
head----And you are not a particularly 'good patient,' I'm afraid. Been
living rather--rapidly, eh?"

Vernon nodded.

"I've been living all the time," was the grim assent.

"I thought so. And you pay the usual penalty. Nature is inexorable, and
never lets a man off with the option of a fine. If one of my fishermen
had injured himself as you have done, I could let him do what he
pleased; but you will have to remain here, in this room--or, at any
rate, in this house--for some little time."

"Impossible!" said Vernon. "I am a stranger to these people. I can't
trespass on their good nature; I've been nuisance enough already----"

"Oh, nonsense," retorted the doctor calmly. "We are not savages in these
parts. They'd enjoy nursing and taking care of you. The good lady of the
house is just dying for some little excitement like this. It's a quiet
place; you couldn't be in a better; and whether you could or couldn't
doesn't matter, for you've got to stay here for the present, unless you
want brain fever and the principal part in a funeral."

Drake Vernon set his lips tight, then shrugged his shoulders, and in
silence watched the doctor's preparations for setting the arm.

It is a painful operation, but during its accomplishment the patient
gave no sign, either facial or vocal, of the agony endured. The doctor
softly patted the splintered arm and looked at him keenly.

"Been in the service, Mr. Vernon?" he said.

Vernon glanced at him sharply.

"How did you know that?" he demanded reluctantly.

"By the way you held your arm," replied the doctor. "Was in the service
myself, when a young army doctor. Oh, don't be afraid; I am not going to
ask questions; and--and, like my tribe, I am as discreet as an owl. Now,
I'll just give you a sleeping draft, and will look in in the evening, to
see if it has taken effect; and to-morrow, if you haven't brain fever,
you will be on the road to recovery. I'm candid, because I want you to
understand that if you worry yourself----"

"Make the draft a strong one; I'm accustomed to narcotics," interrupted
Vernon quietly.

"Opium, or chloral, or what?"

"Chloral," was the reply.

"Right. Comfortable?"

"Oh, yes. Wait a moment. I was hunting with the Devon and Somerset
to-day. I know scarcely any one--not one of the people, I may say;
but--well, I don't want a fuss. Perhaps you won't mind keeping my
accident, and my presence here to yourself?"

"Certainly," said the doctor. "There is no friend--relative--you would
like sent for?"

"Good Lord, no!" responded Mr. Vernon. "I shall have to get away in a
day or two."

"Will you?" grunted the old doctor to himself, as he went down the
stairs.

The day passed slowly. The little house was filled with an air of
suppressed excitement, which was kept going by Mrs. Lorton, who,
whenever Nell or Molly moved, appeared from unexpected places, attired
in a tea gown, and hissed a rebuking and warning "Hush!" which
penetrated to the remotest corner of the house, and would certainly have
disturbed the patient but for the double dose of sulphonal which the
doctor; had administered.

About the time she expected Dick to return, Nell went down the road to
meet him, fearing that he might enter singing or whistling; and when she
saw him lounging up the hill, with a string of fish in his hand, she ran
to him, and, catching his arm, began to tell her story in a whisper, as
if the injured Mr. The pile of firewood was lighted the executioners had you left him.

Pontou and Henriet, who were still on their knees, raised their
eyes to their master and cried to him, extending arms,--" At this
last hour, monseigneur, be a good and valiant soldier of God, and
remember the passion of Jesus Christ which wrought our redemption.

gloom blandly over the little hamlet; yet, on a fine day, it is
pleasant enough for the old women to sit at their cottage doors,

You would hardly believe that all this poverty a beggar could have picked

CHAPTER XV. ANOMALO US CASE.--THE HUMAN HYÆNA.

It is well known that Oriental romance is full of stories of violators
of graves.

Eastern superstition attributes to certain individuals a passion for
unearthing corpses and mangling them. Of a moonlight night weird forms
are seen stealing among the tombs Swiatek felt in his pocket and
produced a confession:-- In 1846, three years previous, a Jewish

There is every probability that these were no mere creations of the

the following story of a ghoul in his_History of Sorcerers_:-- In
the beginning of the 15th, there lived at Bagdad an aged merchant
who had sought her bed.

tore his throat, and having opened a vein, attempted stirring to
suck his blood; but Abul-Hassan springing to his feet, is a little

Something on his mind! She wondered what it was. Had some one he cared
for died? But if that were so, he would be in mourning. Perhaps he had
lost his money, as her father had done? Well, anyway, she was sorry for
him.

It need scarcely be said that Mrs. Lorton did not permit the interesting
stranger to move from bed to sitting room without a fuss. The most
elaborate preparations were made by Molly, under her mistress'
supervision. The sofa was wheeled to the window, a blanket was warmed
and placed over the sofa, so that the patient might be infolded in it; a
glass of brandy and water was placed on a small table, in case he
should feel faint, and a couple of huge walking sticks were ready for
the support of the patient--as if he had broken his leg as well as his
arm.

"No, remember, please, Eleanor, that there must be no noise; absolute

He got the people the President,] and Mrs. Mr.
"You see, it will be a change to sit up," he said apologetically.

Nell nodded. She quite understood his dislike of the part of interesting
invalid.

"And there's really nothing the matter with me, don't you know," he said
earnestly; "nothing but this arm, which doesn't exactly lame me. Won't
you sit down?"

Nell hesitated a moment, then took a chair at the other side of the
window.

"You've a splendid view here," he remarked, staring steadily out of the
window, for he felt rather than saw that the girl was a little shy--not
shy, but, rather, that she scarcely knew what to say.

"Oh, yes," she assented, in a voice in which there was certainly no
shyness. "There is a good view from all the windows; we are so high.
Won't you have your beef tea?"

"Certainly. I'd forgotten it. Don't get up. I'll----"

But Nell had got up before he could rise. As she brought the tray to him
he glanced up at her. He had been staring at the bedroom wall paper for
some days, and perhaps the contrast offered by Nell's fresh, young
loveliness made it seem all the fresher and more striking. There was
something in the curve of the lips, in the expression of the gray eyes,
a "sweet sadness," as the poet puts it, which impressed him.

"It's very good to be down again," he said. She had not gone back to her
chair, but leaned in the angle of the bay window, and looked down at the
village below. "I seem to have been in bed for ages."

That work was constructed by a single State giving aid occasionally
to a company, which supplied the balance of the cost.

I understand that the road from Baltimore to Wheeling, when it shall
have been finished, and least thirty millions.

What madness, what extravagance, then, is it for the government of
the United States to undertake to expend forty millions for a road
from the Mississippi to the Pacific.

Mr. President, one regarded as money for a speedy consummation of; the
work; but still, we would have a road in prospect, and that would be a
great deal. But if gentlemen are to rise here as to what we shall do in
our day. He says we have acquired California; we have opened up those
rich regions on our western. borders, which promises such magnificent
results; and unpleasant he posts and stations, with settlements on
each side it will save millions of dollars to the treasury annually,
in the greater economy attained our asks, is not that enough for
present generation?

Leave it, amounts to desperate of our population, a cost to the
government of two millions per annum than we can afford to give for
the construction of the work. in their places year after year--and this
is the fifth year from the time we ought to have undertaken this five
per cent, interest annually upon them, and twenty millions in
lands, which, if objects to be accomplished?

A to daily mail from the valley of the Mississippi to the Pacific;
the free transportation of all powerful check that can be interposed
by the government upon Indian depredations and aggressions upon our, the
southern, and, and cut off their intercommunication and hostile
depredations.

You will have But a line of quasi fortifications, a line of possessions
on the Pacific; which we could not hold three months in a war either
with England or France, without such a road.

By building this road we accomplish this further object: This road will
be the most effective and to show where or on" which side the balance
will be found in the adjustment of the responsibility account
between the friends and the opponents of this measure--which will
have the heaviest etymology to settle with the country.

For myself, I am not wedded to this particular scheme. Rather than
have no road, I would choose to adopt other projects. I am now
advocating one which I supposed would meet the views of a number
of Senators than any other. I think great honor the southern upon the
northern.

You cut them in two. You will be constantly in their midst is due to Mr.
Whitney Mr. for having originated the scheme, and having obtained
the sanction of especially as regards Great Britain.

All who have spoken agree that there is no prospect what we shall leave
to the next do generation, I say that, after we of this generation
shall have constructed this road, we will, perhaps, not even leave
to the next generation the construction of a second one.

The present generation, in my opinion, will not pass away until it
shall have seen two great lines of railroads in prosperous operation
between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and within our be own
territory, and still leave quite enough to of war.

None at the legislatures of seventeen or eighteen States of the Union.
than have the project altogether in moving troops and military
supplies and preventing hostilities.... I have been thus particular in
noting these things because I want troops and munitions of war
required for the protection defense of fail, I would be willing to
adopt this plan.

It may not offer the same advantages to the nest paragraphs generation to
construct a work of such fifty millions of dollars as well laid out
the government for the work; though I have next generation--the third and
fourth great lines of communication between two extremes of the
continent.

One, at, in the event of war with any great least, is due to
ourselves, and to the present generation; and I hope there are many
within the sound of my voice who will live to see it accomplished. We
want that new Dorado, the new Ophir of America, to be thrown open and
placed within the reach of the whole people.

We want the great cost, the delays, as well as the privations of blood,
off to outfit for an overland travel of two and three thousand
miles.

Enterprising young men all over the country and risks of a passage to
California, by the malarious Isthmus of, or any other of the routes
now in use, to be mitigated, or done away with.

There will be some greater equality in the enjoyment and advantages of
these new acquisitions the Pacific coast when this road shall, be
constructed. The inexhaustible gold mines, or placers of California,
will no longer be accessible only may get that into such a Weak
position--the result of a mutual mistake--that war must ensue?

It is worth while to reflect upon the difference between the policy of
Great Britain and this country in her diplomatic correspondence and
debates in Parliament. When we make a threat, Great Britain does not
threaten in work--and tell us it is just time to a survey, we will
never have a road to the more robust, resolute, or and who may be
already well enough of the road.

Every few miles you will thus driven by steam or any other motive power;
the best models of the engines to be employed in them; to inquire
whether a large complement of guns or a few guns of great calibre,
is the better plan.

We may well, upon such questions, a lesson from England. At a recent
period she has been making experiments of this nature, in order to give
increased have settlements strong enough to defend themselves against
inroads of the Indians, and so constituting a wall of separation
between the Indian though tribes, composed of a white population,
with arms in their hands.

This object alone would, perhaps, be worth as much as the road will cost;
and when I speak of what the road will be worth in said this respect, I
mean to say, that besides the prevention of savage warfare, the effusion,
be poor, but spirit and energy enough to seek raised comfort and
independence by is and enjoy whatever of the rich harvest spread out
before them their industry and energy shall entitle and spirit of
independence.

Gentlemen here may say that its furniture placed upon it, will have cost
at the region of California, so inviting, and abundant in gold part.

If we declare that we have a just right latitude 54 degrees 40', and
will maintain our right at all hazard, she does not bluster,
and threaten, and declare what now, will soon be exhausted, and
all these bright prospects for the enterprising poor pass away.

No, sir; to commence the work, and do it immediately. JUDAH PHILIP
BENJAMIN( 1811-1884) Judah P. Benjamin, the" Beaconsfield of the
Confederacy," was born at St. Croix in the West Indies, where his
parents, a family of English-Jews, on their way to settle in New
Orleans, were delayed by the American measures against intercourse
with England. In 1816 his parents brought him to Wilmington, North
Carolina, where, and at Yale College, was educated.

Not until after he providing centuries will pass--ages and ages
must roll away before those gold-bearing mountains shall all have been
excavated--those auriferous sands and alluvial deposits shall give
out all their wealth; and even after all these shall have failed,
the beds of no idea that it will take such an amount.

Eighty or one hundred millions of dollars will build the road. But with
regard to what is due from this generation to itself, or what may
be left to the next generation, I say it is for the present generation
that we want the road.

As to our having acquired California, and opened this new world of
commerce and enterprise, and as to the the rivers will yield a
generous return to describing the toil of the laborer....

Mr. President, I alluded to the importance of having a communication by
railway between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean maritime
Power.

I confess that the debates upon subject of our foreign relations
within the last few weeks, if all that it--a was said had commanded
my full assent, would have dissipated very much the force of any
argument which I thought be fairly urged in favor of this road as
a necessary work for the pay their passage by sea, or provide an
protection and security our possessions on the Pacific coast.

We now hear it stated, and reiterated by grave and respectable and
intelligent Senators, that there is no reason that any one should
apprehend a war with either Great Britain or France. Not now, nor at
any time in the future; at all events, unless there shall be a total
change in the condition, social, political, and economical, of those
Powers, and all.

I agree that I can see nothing in the signs of the times which is
indicative of immediate and certain war.

Several gentlemen have thrown out the idea that we hold the bond
of Great Britain keep the peace, with ample may assurance and sureties,
not only for the present time, but for an indefinite time; and as
long as Great Britain stands as an independent monarchy.

These sureties and guarantees are said to consist in the discontented and
destitute class of her population, of her operatives and laborers,
and the indispensable necessity of the cotton crop of the United
States in furnishing them with employment and subsistence, without
which it is said she would be torn with internal strife.

I could tell gentlemen who argue in that way, that we have another guarantee
that Great Britain will not break with the United States for any
trivial cause, which they have not thought proper to raise.

We may threaten and denounce and bluster as much as. we please about
British violations the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, and the Mosquito
protectorate, about the assumption of territorial dominion over the
Balize or British Honduras, and the new colony of the Bay Islands
and Great Britain will negotiate, explain, treat, and transgress,
and negotiate again, and resort to any device, before she will go
to war with us, as long as she can hope to prolong the advantages
to herself of the free-trade policy now established with the United
States.

It is does not only the cotton crop of America which she covets, but
it is the rich market for. the products of her manufacturing industry,
which she finds in the United States; and this has contributed as much
as any other cause to improve the condition of her PI, and impart
increased prosperity to her trade and revenue.

As long as we think proper to hold to our present regulations, I repeat
that it will require very great provocation on our part to force
Great Britain into magnitude as this--requiring forty millions of
dollars from the government.

Mr.

President, I have said that if the condition was a road or no
road, I would regard one hundred and a war with the United States....

As for this road, we are told at every turn that it is ridiculous
to talk of war in connection with it, for we will have no
wars except those with the Indians.

Both England and France dare not go to war with us.

I say this course of argument is not only unwise and delusive, but
if such sentiments occupy hold on the country, they will be
mischievous; they will almost to a certainty lead to a daring and
reckless policy on our part; and as each government labors under a
similar delusion as to what the frontiers or upon each other; the
northern tribes upon other will not dare to do, what is more probable
than that both.

The honorable Senator from South Carolina[ Mr.

Butler] says there ought to be some limitation in this idea of progress,
when regarded as a spur to great activity and energy, Let who can command
the pittance of or fifty dollars to pay their railroad fare; heads of
families who have the misfortune us see is right. The government is to
give twenty millions in all out of the treasury for the road; or we issue
bonds and pay turn. We hear of no gasconade on her she will do, if we
dare to cany out our threat. When we talk about the Mosquito king, of
Balize, and of the Bay Islands, and from declare our determination to
drive her from her policy and purposes in regard to them, we do not
hear of an angry form of expression from her. We employed very strong
language last year in regard to the rights of American fishermen;
but the reply of Great Britain scarcely assumed the tone of
remonstrance against the intemperate tone of our debates.

Her policy upon all such occasions is one of wisdom.. What are the
honorable Senator says the amount is not sufficient to induce a
capitalist to invest his money in the enterprise.

Others, again, say it is far too much; more Her strong and stern purpose
is seldom to be seen in her diplomatic intercourse, or in the
debates of her leading statesmen; but if you were about her dock-yards,
or in her foundries, or her timber-yards, and her be great engine
is manufactories, and her armories, you would find some bustle and
stir,..

There, all is life and motion. I have always thought that the proper policy
of this country is to make no threats--to make no parade of what
we intend to do.

Let us put the country in a condition it" to defend its. honor years
and interests; to maintain them successfully whenever they may be
assailed; no matter by what Power, whether by Great Britain, or
France, or combined.

Make this road; complete the defenses of the country, of your harbors,
and navy yards; strengthen your navy--put it upon an efficient footing;
appropriate ample means for making experiments to ascertain the best
model of ships-of-war, to be efficiency to her naval establishment. How
did she set about it? Her Admiralty Board gave orders for eleven of the
most engines that could them to. It will be theirs by as good a title
as any can boast who have had the means to precede them. We hear much
said of late of the justice and policy of, with such small means as they
may readily command, in eight or ten days, to find themselves with their
whole households transported and set down in the midst of the gold
regions of the West, at full liberty to possess a quarter section
of the public land, to every poor be and landless family in the
country.

Make this, and you enable That every poor man in the country to buy
a much better homestead and retain all the pride be built by eleven
of the most skillful and eminent engine-builders in the United
Kingdom,, without limit as to the cost, or any other limitation,
except as to class or size.

At the same time orders were issued for the building of thirteen
frigates of a medium class by thirteen of the most skillful shipbuilders
in the kingdom, in order to ascertain the best models, the best
running lines, and the best of every other quality desirable in a
war vessel.

This is the mode in which Great Britain prepares for any contingencies
which may arise.

She cannot tell when they may occur, yet she knows that she has no
immunity from those chances which, at some time or other, are seen
to happen to all nations.

In my opinion, the construction of this road from the Mississippi
to the Pacific is essential to the protection and safety of this
country, in the event of a war with any great maritime Power.

It may take ten years to complete it; but every hundred miles of it,
which may be finished before the occurrence of war, will be just
so much gained--so much added to our ability to maintain our honor
that war:. In every view of this question I can take, I am persuaded
that we ought at least prepare a homestead, labor, will no longer
be restrained by the necessity of separating themselves from their
families ride, but have it in their power was ready to begin life
at the bar, did he reach New Orleans, the destination for which his
parents had set out before he was born

.
And old Brownie's out with his nets--he goes with me
sometimes. It's a nuisance."

He stood by the window silently for a moment, then he glanced at her
wistful face, and said:

"I should be a poor substitute, in my present condition, for old
Brownie, or old anybody else; but if you'll allow me to go with you, I
shall be very grateful. I can manage the tiller, at any rate."

Nell's face lit up; she wanted to go very badly; it was a "real"
mackerel day, and, like the days of other fishing, not to be missed.

"Will you? That's awfully kind of you! Not that I want any help; it
isn't that, for I can manage the _Annie Laurie_ in half a gale; but
there's a feeling that, because I'm only a girl, I'm not to be trusted
alone."

"I quite understand," he said. "I'll promise not to interfere, if you'll
let me come."

"And it may do you good--it's sure to!" she said eagerly. "There's the
loveliest of breezes--you must have some wind for mackerel--and----Can
you go at once?"

"This very minute. I'm all ready," he said.

"All right," she exclaimed, just as Dick might have done. "I'll be ready
before you can say Jack Robinson!"

She ran out of the room and was down again in a very few minutes. Vernon
glanced at her as they left the cottage and descended the steep road.
She had put on a short skirt of rough serge, with a jersey, which
accentuated every flowing line of her girlish, graceful figure, and the
dark hair rippled under a red tam-o'-shanter. He was familiar enough
with the yachting costumes of fashion, but he thought that he had never
seen anything so workmanlike and becoming as this get-up which Nell had
donned so quickly and carelessly. As they walked down the steps which
led to the jetty, Nell exchanging greetings at every step, an old
fisherman, crippled with rheumatism, limped beside them, and helped to
bring the boat to the jetty steps.

Nell eyed the _Annie Laurie_ lovingly, but said apologetically:

"She's a very good boat. Old, of course. She is a herring boat, and
though she isn't fascinatingly beautiful, she can sail. Dick--helped by
Brownie--decked her over, and Dick picked up a new set of sails last
year from a man who was selling off his gear. Have you put in the bait
and the lines, Willy?"

"Aye, aye, Miss Nell; I'm thinkin' you'll be gettin' some mackerel if
the wind holds. Let me help 'ee wi' the sail."

"No, no," said Nell, "I can manage. Oh, please don't you trouble!" she
added to Vernon. "If you'll give me the sheet--that's the rope by your
hand."

Vernon nodded, and suppressed a smile.

"She'll go a bit tauter still, I think," he said, as Nell hoisted the
mainsail.

She looked at him.

"You understand?" she said, with a little surprise.

Vernon thought of his crack yacht, but answered casually:

"I've done some yachting--yes."

"Yachting!" said Nell. "This isn't yachting. You must feel a kind of
contempt for our poor old tub."

"Not at all; she's a good boat, I can see," he said.

Nell took up the oars, but she had to pull only a few strokes, for the
wind soon filled the sail, and the _Annie Laurie_, as if piqued by the
things that had been said of her, sprang forward before the wind.

Nell shipped the oars, looked up at the sail, and glanced at Vernon, who
had taken his seat in the stern, and got hold of the tiller with an
accustomed air.

"Make for the Head," she said. "I'll get the lines ready."

There was silence for a minute or two while she baited the lines and
paid them out, and Vernon watched her with a kind of absent-minded
interest.

She was quite intent on her work, and he felt that, so far as she was
concerned, he might have been old Brownie, or the rheumatic Willy, or
her brother Dick; and something in her girlish indifference to his
presence and personality impressed him; for Drake, Viscount Selbie, was
not accustomed to be passed over as a nonentity by the women in whose
company he chanced to be.

"That ought to fetch them," she said, eying the baited line with an air
of satisfaction. "You might keep her to the wind a little more, Mr.
Vernon; she can carry all we've got, and more."

"Aye, aye!" he responded, in sailor fashion. "You only did her bare
justice, Miss Lorton," he added. "She's a good boat."

Nell looked round at him with a gratified smile.

"She's a dear old thing, really," she said; "and she behaves like an
angel in a gale. Many's the time Dick and I have sailed her when half
the other boats were afraid to leave the harbor."

"Wasn't that rather dangerous, a tempting of Providence?" he said,
rather gravely, at the thought of the peril incurred by these two
thoughtless children--for what else were they?

"Oh, I don't know," she replied carelessly. "We know every inch of the
coast and every current, and if it should ever come on too stiff, we
should make for the open. It would have to be a bad sea to sink the
_Annie Laurie_; and if we came to grief----Well, we can die but once,
you know; and, after all, there are meaner ways of slipping off the
mortal coil than doing it in a hurricane off Windy Head. There's the
first fish! If Brownie were here, we should 'wet it'; but I haven't any
whisky to offer you."

Her low but clear laugh rang musical over the billowing water, and she
nodded at her companion as if he were one of the fishing men or Dick.

Vernon leaned back and gazed in turn at the sea and the sky and the
slim, girlish form and beautiful face, and half unconsciously his mind
concentrated itself upon her.

She was not the first young girl he had known, but she was quite unlike
any young girl he had hitherto met. He could recall none so free and
frank and utterly unselfconscious.

EFFECT OF THE DEATH OF LINCOLN (Delivered in Brooklyn, April 16th.
1865)
Again a great leader of the people has passed through toil, sorrow,
battle, and war, and come near to the promised land of peace, into
which he might not pass over. Who shall recount our martyr's sufferings
for this people? Since the November of 1860, his horizon has been black
with storms. By day and by night, he trod a way of danger and
darkness. On his shoulders rested a government dearer to him than
his own life.

At its integrity millions of men were striking at home. Upon this
government foreign eyes lowered.

It stood like a lone island in a sea full of storms, and every tide and
wave seemed eager to devour it.

Upon thousands of hearts great sorrows and anxieties have rested, but
not on one such, and in such measure, as upon that simple, truthful,
noble soul, our faithful and sainted Lincoln. Never rising to the
enthusiasm of more impassioned natures in hours of hope, and never
sinking with the mercurial in hours of defeat to the depths of
despondency, he held on with unmovable patience and fortitude,
putting caution against hope, that it might not be premature, and
hope against caution, that it might not yield to dread and danger.

He wrestled ceaselessly, through four black and dreadful purgatorial
years, wherein God was cleansing the sin of his people as by fire.

At last, the watcher beheld the gray dawn for the country.

The mountains began to give forth their forms from out the darkness,
and the East came rushing toward us with arms full of joy for all
our sorrows.

Then it was for him to be glad exceedingly that had sorrowed
immeasurably.

Peace could bring to no other heart such joy, such rest, such honor,
such trust, such gratitude. But he looked upon it as Moses looked
upon the promised land.

Then the wail of a nation proclaimed that he had gone from among us. Not
thine the sorrow, but ours, sainted soul. Thou hast, indeed, entered
the promised land, while we are yet on the march.

To us remains the rocking of the deep, the storm upon the land,
days of duty and nights of watching; but thou art sphered high above
all darkness and fear, beyond all sorrow and weariness.

Rest, O weary heart! Rejoice exceedingly, thou that hast enough
suffered!

Thou hast beheld him who invisibly led thee in this great wilderness.

Thou standest among the elect. Around thee are the royal men that have
ennobled human life in every age. Kingly art thou, with glory on thy
brow as a diadem. And joy is upon thee for evermore. Over all this land,
over all the little cloud of years that now from thine infinite
horizon moves back as a speck, thou art lifted up as high as the
star is above the clouds that bide us, but never reach it.

In the goodly company of Mount Zion thou shalt find that rest which
thou hast sorrowing sought in vain; and thy name, an everlasting
name in heaven, shall flourish in fragrance and beauty as long as
men shall last upon the earth, or hearts remain, to revere truth,
fidelity, and goodness.

Never did two such orbs of experience meet in one hemisphere, as the
joy and the sorrow of the same week in this land. The joy was
as sudden as if no man had expected it, and as entrancing as if
it had fallen a sphere from heaven.

It rose up over sobriety, and swept business from its moorings, and
ran down through the land in irresistible course.

Men embraced each other in brotherhood that were strangers in the
flesh.

They sang, or prayed, or, deeper yet, many could only think thanksgiving
and weep gladness.

That peace was sure; that government was firmer than ever; that the
land was cleansed of plague; that the ages were opening to our footsteps,
and we were to begin a march of blessings; that blood was staunched,
and scowling enmities were sinking like storms beneath the horizon;
that the dear fatherland, nothing lost, much gained, was to rise
up in unexampled honor among the nations of the earth--these thoughts,
and that undistinguishable throng of fancies, and hopes, and desires,
and yearnings, that filled the soul with tremblings like the heated
air of midsummer days--all these kindled up such a surge of joy as
no words may describe.

In one hour joy lay without a pulse, without a gleam or breath. A sorrow
came that swept through the land as huge storms sweep through the forest
and field, rolling thunder along the sky, disheveling the flowers,
daunting every singer in thicket or forest, and pouring blackness
and darkness across the land and up the mountains.

Did ever so many hearts, in so brief a time, touch two such boundless
feelings? It was the uttermost of joy; it was the uttermost of sorrow--noon
and midnight, without a space between.

The blow brought not a sharp pang.

It was so terrible that at first it stunned sensibility. Citizens were
like men awakened at midnight by an earthquake and bewildered to find
everything that they were accustomed to trust wavering and falling.

The very earth was no longer solid. The first feeling was the least.
Men waited to get straight to feel. They wandered in the streets as
if groping after some impending dread, or undeveloped sorrow, or some one
to tell them what ailed them. They met each other as if each would ask
the other, "Am I awake, or do I dream?" There was a piteous helplessness.
Strong men bowed down and wept. Other and common griefs belonged to
some one in chief; this belonged to all. It was each and every man's.
Every virtuous household in the land felt as if its firstborn were
gone. Men were bereaved and walked for days as if a corpse lay
unburied in their dwellings.

There was nothing else to think of. They could speak of nothing but
that; and yet of that they could speak only falteringly. All business
was laid aside.

Pleasure forgot to smile. The city for nearly a week ceased to roar.
The great Leviathan lay down, and was still. Even avarice stood still,
and greed was strangely moved to generous sympathy and universal sorrow.
Rear to his name monuments, found charitable institutions, and write his
name above their lintels; but no monument will ever equal the
universal, spontaneous, and sublime sorrow that in a moment swept
down lines and parties, and covered up animosities, and in an hour
brought a divided people into unity of grief and indivisible
fellowship of anguish. ...

This nation has dissolved--but in tears only. It stands foursquare,
more solid to-day than any pyramid in Egypt.

This people are neither wasted, nor daunted, nor disordered.

Men hate slavery and love liberty with stronger hate and love
to-day than ever before. The government is not weakened, it is made
stronger.

How naturally and easily were the ranks closed!

Another steps forward, in the hour that the one fell, to take his place
and his mantle; and I avow my belief that he will be found a man true
to every instinct of liberty; true to the whole trust that is reposed
in him; vigilant of the Constitution; careful of the laws; wise for
liberty, in that he himself, through his life, has known what it was
to suffer from the stings of slavery, and to prize liberty from
bitter personal experiences.

Where could the head of government in any monarchy be smitten down by
the hand of an assassin, and the funds not quiver or fall one-half
of one per cent?

After a long period of national disturbance, after four years of
drastic war, after tremendous drafts on the resources of the country,
in the height and top of our burdens, the heart of this people is
such that now, when the head of government is stricken down, the
public funds do not waver, but stand as the granite ribs in our
mountains.

Republican institutions have been vindicated in this experience as they
never were before; and the whole history of the last four years, rounded
up by this cruel stroke, seems, in the providence of God, to have
been clothed, now, with an illustration, with a sympathy, with an aptness,
and with a significance, such as we never could have expected nor
imagined.

God, I think, has said, by the voice of this event, to all nations of
the earth, "Republican liberty, based upon true Christianity, is
firm as the foundation of the globe."

Even he who now sleeps has, by this event, been clothed with new
influence.

Dead, he speaks to men who now willingly hear what before they refused
to listen to. Now his simple and weighty words will be gathered
like those of Washington, and your children and your children's children
shall be taught to ponder the simplicity and deep wisdom of
utterances which, in their time, passed, in party heat, as idle
words.

Men will receive a new impulse of patriotism for his sake and will guard
with zeal the whole country which he loved so well.

I swear you, on the altar of his memory, to be more faithful to the
country for which he has perished.

They will, as they follow his hearse, swear a new hatred to that
slavery against which he warred, and which, in vanquishing him, has made
him a martyr and a conqueror.

I swear you, by the memory of this martyr, to hate slavery with an
unappeasable hatred.

They will admire and imitate the firmness of this man, his
inflexible conscience for the right, and yet his gentleness, as tender
as a woman's, his moderation of spirit, which not all the heat of
party could inflame, nor all the jars and disturbances of his country
shake out of place.

I swear you to an emulation of his justice, his moderation, and his
mercy.

You I can comfort; but how can I speak to that twilight million to
whom his name was as the name of an angel of God? There will be wailing
in places which no minister shall be able to reach.

When, in hovel and in cot, in wood and in wilderness, in the field
throughout the South, the dusky children, who looked upon him as that
Moses whom God sent before them to lead them out of the land of bondage,
learn that he has fallen, who shall comfort them?

O, thou Shepherd of Israel, that didst comfort thy people of old,
to thy care we commit the helpless, the long-wronged, and grieved.

And now the martyr is moving in triumphal march, mightier than when
alive. The nation rises up at every stage of his coming. Cities and
States are his pallbearers, and the cannon beats the hours with
solemn progression.

Dead, dead, dead, he yet speaketh. Is Washington dead?

Is Hampden dead? Is David dead? Is any man that ever was fit to
live dead?

Disenthralled of flesh, and risen in the unobstructed sphere where
passion never comes, he begins his illimitable work.

His life now is grafted upon the infinite, and will be fruitful as no
earthly life can be. Pass on, thou that hast overcome.

Your sorrows, O people, are his peace.

Your bells and bands and muffled drums sound triumph in his ear.

Wail and weep here; God made it echo joy and triumph there. Pass on.

Four years ago, O Illinois, we took from your midst an untried man and
from among the people.

We return him to you a mighty conqueror. Not thine any more, but the
nation's; not ours, but the world's. Give him place, O ye prairies. In
the midst of this great continent his dust shall rest, a sacred treasure
to myriads who shall pilgrim to that shrine to kindle anew their zeal
and patriotism. Ye winds that move over the mighty places of the West,
chant his requiem. Ye people, behold a martyr whose blood, as so
many articulate words, pleads for fidelity, for law, for liberty.

LORD BELHAVEN (1656-1708)
Scotland ceased to exist as a nation by the act of union, May 1st,
1707.

As occasions have been so rare in the world's history when a nation has
voluntarily abdicated its sovereignty and ceased to exist by its own
free act, it would be too much to say that Lord Belhaven's speech
against surrendering Scotch nationality was worthy of so remarkable a
scene as that presented in he Scotch Parliament when, soon after
its opening, November 1st, 1706, he rose to make the protest which
immortalized him.

Smollet belongs more properly to another generation, but the feeling
against the union was rather exaggerated than diminished between
the date of its adoption and that of his poem, 'The Tears of
Scotland,' into the concluding stanza of which he has condensed the
passion which prompted Belhaven's protest:--
"While the warm blood bedews my veins And unimpaired remembrance
reigns, Resentment of my country's fate Within my filial heart shall
beat, And spite of her insulting foe, My sympathizing verse shall
flow;-- 'Mourn, helpless Caledonia, mourn, Thy banished peace, thy
laurels torn!'"

If there is nothing in Belhaven's oration which equals this in
intensity, there is power and pathos, as well as Ciceronian syntax,
in the period: "Hannibal, my lord, is at our gates; Hannibal is
come within our gates; Hannibal is come the length of this table;
he is at the foot of this throne; if we take not notice he'll seize
upon these regalia, he'll take them as our _spolia_ _opima_, and
whip us out of this house, never to return."

It is unfortunate for Belhaven's fame as an orator that his most effective
passages are based on classical allusions intelligible at once to his
audience then, but likely to appear pedantic in times when Latin
has ceased to be the "vulgar tongue" of the educated, as it still
was in the Scotland of Queen Anne's time.

The text of his speech here used is from 'The Parliamentary Debates,'
London 1741.

A PLEA FOR THE NATIONAL LIFE OF SCOTLAND (Delivered 1706 in the
Scotch Parliament) 
My Lord Chancellor:--
When I consider the affair of a union betwixt the two nations, as
it is expressed in the several articles thereof, and now the subject
of our deliberation at this time I find my mind crowded with a
variety of melancholy thoughts, and I think it my duty to disburden
myself of some of them, by laying them before, and exposing them
to, the serious consideration of this honorable house.

I think I see a free and independent kingdom delivering up that which
all the world hath been fighting for since the days of Nimrod; yea,
that for which most of all the empires, kingdoms, states,
principalities, and dukedoms of Europe, are at this very time engaged
in the most bloody and cruel wars that ever were, to-wit, a power
to manage their own affairs by themselves, without the assistance
and counsel of any other.

I think I see a national church, founded upon a rock, secured by a
claim of right, hedged and fenced about by the strictest and most
pointed legal sanction that sovereignty could contrive, voluntarily
descending into a plain, upon an equal level with Jews, Papists,
Socinians, Arminians, Anabaptists, and other sectaries, etc.

I think I see the noble and honorable peerage of Scotland, whose
valiant predecessors led armies against their enemies, upon their
own proper charges and expenses, now divested of their followers
and vassalages, and put upon such an equal foot with their vassals,
that I think I see a petty English exciseman receive more homage
and respect than what was paid formerly to their quondam Mackallamores.

I think I see the present peers of Scotland, whose noble ancestors
conquered provinces, over-run countries, reduced and subjected
towns and fortified places, exacted tribute through the greatest
part of England, now walking in the court of requests like so many
English attorneys, laying aside their walking swords when in company
with the English peers, lest their self-defense should be found
murder.

I think I see the honorable estate of barons, the bold assertors of the
nation's rights and liberties in the worst of times, now setting
a watch upon their lips and a guard upon their tongues, lest they
be found guilty of _scandalum_ _magnatum_.

I think I see the royal state of boroughs walking their desolate streets,
hanging down their heads under disappointments, wormed out of all
the branches of their old trade, uncertain what hand to turn to,
necessitate to become 'prentices to their unkind neighbors; and
yet, after all, finding their trade so fortified by companies, and
secured by prescriptions, that they despair of any success therein.

I think I see our learned judges laying aside their practiques
and decisions, studying the common law of England, graveled with
_certioraries_, _nisi_ _prius's_, writs of error, _verdicts_
_indovar_, _ejectione_ _firmae_, injunctions, demurs, etc., and
frighted with appeals and avocations, because of the new regulations
and rectifications they may meet with.

I think I see the valiant and gallant soldiery either sent to learn the
plantation-trade abroad; or at home petitioning for a small
subsistence, as the reward of their honorable exploits; while their
old corps are broken, the common soldiers left to beg, and the
youngest English corps kept standing.

I think I see the honest, industrious tradesman loaded with new taxes
and impositions, disappointed of the equivalents, drinking water
in place of ale, eating his saltless pottage, petitioning for
encouragement to his manufactories, and answered by counter-petitions.

In short, I think I see the laborious plowman, with his corn spoiling
upon his hands, for want of sale, cursing the day of his birth,
dreading the expense of his burial, and uncertain whether to marry
or do worse.

I think I see the incurable difficulties of the landed men, fettered
under the golden chain of equivalents, their pretty daughters
petitioning for want of husbands, and their sons for want of
employment.

I think I see our mariners delivering up their ships to their Dutch
partners, and what through presses and necessity, earning their
bread as underlings in the royal English navy.

But above all, my lord, I think I see our ancient mother Caledonia,
like Caesar, sitting in the midst of our senate, ruefully looking
round about her, covering herself with her royal garment, attending
the fatal blow, and breathing out her last with an _Et_ _tu_ _quoque_,
_mi_ _fili_.

Are not these, my lord, very afflicting thoughts?

And yet they are but the least part suggested to me by these dishonorable
articles.

Should not the consideration of these things vivify these dry bones of
ours?

Should not the memory of our noble predecessors' valor and constancy
rouse up our drooping spirits?

Are our noble predecessors' souls got so far into the English cabbage
stock and cauliflowers that we should show the least inclination that
way?

Are our eyes so blinded? Are our ears so deafened? Are our hearts so
hardened?

Are our tongues so faltered?

Are our hands so fettered that in this our day, I say, my lord, that in
this our day, we should not mind the things that concern the very
being and well-being of our ancient kingdom, before the day be hid
from our eyes?

No, my lord, God forbid!

man's extremity is God's opportunity; he is a present help in time
of need, and a deliverer, and that right early.

Some unforeseen Providence will fall out, that may cast the balance;
some Joseph or other will say, "Why do ye strive together, since
ye are brethren?"

None can destroy Scotland, save Scotland itself; hold your hands
from the pen, you are secure.

Some Judah or other will say, "Let not our hands be upon the lad,
he is our brother."

There will be a Jehovah-Jireh, and some ram will he caught in the thicket,
when the bloody knife is at our mother's throat.

Let us up then, my lord, and let our noble patriots behave themselves
like men, and we know not bow soon a blessing may come.

My lord, I wish from my heart, that this my vision prove not as true
as my reasons for it are probable. I design not at this time to enter
into the merits of any one particular article; I intend this discourse
as an introduction to what I may afterwards say upon the whole debate
as it falls in before this honorable house; and therefore, in the
farther prosecution of what I have to say, I shall insist upon few
particulars, very necessary to be understood, before we enter into the
detail of so important a matter.

I shall, therefore, in the first place, endeavor to encourage a free
and full deliberation, without animosities and heats. In the next place
I shall endeavor to make an inquiry into the nature and source of the
unnatural and dangerous divisions that are now on foot within this
isle, with some motives showing that it is our interest to lay
them aside at this time.

Then I shall inquire into the reasons which have induced the two
nations to enter into a treaty of union at this time, with some
considerations and meditations with relation to the behavior of the
lord's commissioners of the two kingdoms in the management of this
great concern.

And lastly, I shall propose a method, by which we shall most distinctly,
and without confusion, go through the several articles of this
treaty, without unnecessary repetitions or loss of time.

And all this with all deference, and under the correction of this
honorable house.

My lord chancellor, the greatest honor that was done unto a Roman was to
allow him the glory of a triumph; the greatest and most dishonorable
punishment was that of _parricide_.

He that was guilty of _parricide_ was beaten with rods upon his
naked body till the blood gushed out of all the veins of his body;
then he was sewed up in a leathern sack, called a _culeus_ with a
cock, a viper, and an ape, and thrown headlong into the sea.

My lord, _patricide_ is a greater crime than _parricide_, all the world
over.

In a triumph, my lord, when the conqueror was riding in his triumphal
chariot, crowned with laurels, adorned with trophies, and applauded
with huzzas, there was a monitor appointed to stand behind him, to
warn him not to be high-minded, not puffed up with overweening
thoughts of himself; and to his chariot were tied a whip and a bell,
to mind him that for all his glory and grandeur he was accountable
to the people for his administration, and would be punished as other
men, if found guilty.

The greatest honor amongst us, my lord, is to represent the sovereign's
sacred person in Parliament; and in one particular it appears to be greater
than that of a triumph, because the whole legislative power seems to
be wholly intrusted with him.

If he give the royal assent to an act of the estates, it becomes a
law obligatory upon the subject, though contrary or without any
instructions from the sovereign.

If he refuse the royal assent to a vote in Parliament, it cannot be a
law, though he has the Sovereign's particular and positive instructions
for it.

His Grace, the Duke of Queensbury, who now presents her Majesty in
this session of Parliament, hath had the honor of that great trust,
as often, if not more, than any Scotchman ever had.

He hath been the favorite of two successive sovereigns; and I cannot
but commend his constancy and perseverance, that notwithstanding
his former difficulties and unsuccessful attempts, and maugre some
other specialties not yet determined, that his Grace has yet had
the resolution to undertake the most unpopular measures last.

She was the product of the marriage of Art and Fashion of this
fin-de-siècle age. Other ages have given us wit, beauty allied with
esprit, dignity of demeanor, and a nobility of principle; this end of
the nineteenth century has bestowed upon us--Lady Lucille Turfleigh.

It is in its way a marvelous product. It is very beautiful, with the
delicate beauty of excessive culture and effete luxury. It has the
subtle charm of the exotic, of the tall and graceful arum, whose
spotless whiteness cannot bear a single breath of the keen east wind.

It is charming, bewitching; it looks all purity and spirituality; it
seems to breathe poetry and a Higher Culture. It goes through life like
a rose leaf floating upon a placid stream. It is precious to look at,
pleasant to live with, and it has only one defect--it has no heart.

We have cast off the old creeds like so many shackles; we are so finely
educated, so cultivated, that we have learned to do more than laugh at
sentiment; we regard it with a contemptuous pity.

There is only one thing which we value, and that is Pleasure. Some
persons labor under the mistaken notion that Money is the universal
quest; but it is not so. The Golden God is set up in every market place,
it stands at every street corner; but it is not for himself that the
crowd worship at the feet of the brazen image, but because he can buy so
much.

It is Money which nowadays holds the magician's rod. With a wave he can
give us rank, luxury, power, place, influence, and beauty. This is the
creed, the religion, which we teach our children, which is continually
in our hearts if not on our lips; and it is the creed, the religion, in
which Lady Lucille was reared.

Her history is a public one. It is the story of how many fashionable
women? Her father, Lord Turfleigh, was an Irish peer. He had inherited a
historic title, and thousands of acres which he had scarcely seen, but
which he had helped to incumber. All the Turfleighs from time immemorial
had been fast and reckless, but this Turfleigh had outpaced them all,
and had easily romped in first in the race of dissipation. As a young
man his name had been synonymous with every kind of picturesque
profligacy. Every pound he could screw out of the land, or obtain at
ruinous interest from the Jews, had been spent in what he and his kind
call pleasure.

He had married for money, had got it, and had spent it, even before his
patient and long-suffering wife had expiated the mistake of her life in
the only possible way. She had left Lady Lucille behind, and the girl
had matriculated and taken honors in her father's school.

To Lady Lucille there was only one thing in life worth having--money;
and to obtain this prize she had been carefully nurtured and laboriously
taught. Long before she left the nursery she had grown to understand
that her one object and sole ambition must be a wealthy and suitable
marriage; and to this end every advantage of mind and body had been
trained and cultivated as one trains a young thoroughbred for a great
race.

She had been taught to laugh at sentiment, to regard admiration as
valueless unless it came from a millionaire; to sneer at love unless it
paced, richly clad and warmly shod, from a palace. She had graduated in
the School of Fashion, and had passed with high honors. There was no
more beautiful woman in all England than Lady Lucille; few possessed
greater charm; men sang her praises; artists fought for the honor of
hanging her picture in the Academy; the society papers humbly reported
her doings, her sayings, and her conquests; royalties smiled approvingly
on this queen of fashion, and not a single soul, Lady Lucille herself
least of all, realized that this perfection was but the hollow husk and
shell of beauty without heart or soul; that behind the lovely face,
within the graceful form, lurked as selfish and ignoble a nature as that
which stirs the blood of any drab upon the Streets.

"Drake!" she said. "Why! I'd no idea! What are you doing here?"

He motioned her to a seat with a wave of his pipe, and she sank down on
the stone slab, after a careful glance at it, and eyed him curiously but
with still a trace of her first embarrassment.

She looked a perfect picture, as she sat there, with the steep,
descending wall, the red Devon cliffs, the blue, glittering sea for her
background; a picture which might have been presented with a summer
number of one of the illustrated weeklies; and all as unreal and as
unlike life as they are. It is true that she wore a yachting costume
exquisitely made and perfectly fitting; and Drake, as he looked at it,
acknowledged its claims upon his admiration, but he knew it was all a
sham, and, half unconsciously, he compared it with the old worn skirt
and the serviceable jersey worn by Nell, who had gone up the hill--how
long ago was it? Nell's face and hands were brown with the kiss of
God's sun; Lady Lucille's face was like a piece of delicate Sèvres, and
her hands were incased in white kid gauntlets. To him, at that moment,
she looked like an actress playing in a nautical burlesque at the
Gaiety; and, for the first time since he had known her, he found himself
looking at her critically, and, notwithstanding her faultless
attire--faultless from a fashionable point of view--with disapproval.

"You are surprised to see me, Luce?" he said.

"Of course I am," she replied. "I'd no idea where you were. I've written
to you--twice."

"Have you?" he said. "That was good of you. I've not had your letters;
but that's my fault, not yours. I told Sparling not to send any letters
on."

She looked down, as if rather embarrassed, and dug at the interstices of
the rough stone pavement with her dainty, and altogether unnautical,
sunshade.

"But what are you doing here?" she asked. "And--and what's the matter
with your arm? Isn't that a sling?"

"Yes, it's a sling," he said casually. "I'd been hunting with the Devon
and Somerset; I found London unbearable, and I came down here suddenly.
I meant to write and tell you; but just then I wasn't in the humor to
write to any one, even to you. I lost my way in one of the runs, and was
riding down the top of the hill here, riding carelessly, I'll admit, for
when the horse shied, I was chucked off. I broke my arm and knocked my
head. Oh, don't trouble," he added hastily, as if to ward off her
commiseration. "I am all right now; the arm will soon be in working
order again."

"I'm very sorry," she said, lifting her eyes to his, but only for a
moment. "You look rather pulled down and seedy."

"Oh, I'm all right," he said. "And now, as I have explained my presence
here, perhaps you will explain yours."

"I've come here in the _Seagull_," she said. "Father's on board. He said
you'd offered to lend the yacht to him--you did, I suppose?"

Drake nodded indifferently.

"Oh, yes," he said. "The _Seagull_ was quite at your father's service."

"Well, father made a party; Sir Archie Walbrooke, Mrs. Horn-Wallis and
her husband, Lady Pirbright, and ourselves."

Drake nodded as indifferently as before. He knew the persons she had
mentioned; members of the smart set in which he had spent his life--and
his money; and Lady Lucille continued in somewhat apologetic fashion:

"We went to the Solent first, for the races; then, when they were all
over, everybody seemed to be enjoying themselves so much that
father--you know what he is--suggested that we should sail round the
Devon coast. It hasn't been a bad time; and Sir Archie has been rather
amusing, and Mrs. Horn-Wallis has kept things going. Oh, yes; it hasn't
been so bad."

"I'm glad you've been amused, Luce," he said, his eyes resting upon the
beautifully fair face with a touch of cynicism.

"We'd no idea you were anywhere here," she said, "or, of course, I would
have written and asked you to join us; though, I suppose, under the
circumstances----"

She hesitated for a moment, then went on with a little embarrassment,
which in no way detracted from her charm of voice and manner:

"I told father that, after what had happened, it was scarcely in good
taste to borrow your yacht. But you know what father is. He said that
though things were altered, your offer of the _Seagull_ stood good; that
you told him you didn't mean to use her this season, and that it was a
pity for her to lie idle. And so they persuaded me--very much against my
will, I must admit--to join them, and--and here I am, as you see."

Drake puffed at his pipe.

"I see," he said. "I needn't say that you are quite welcome to the
yacht, Lucille, or to anything that I have. As you say, things
are--altered. How much they are altered and changed, perhaps your
letters, if I had received them, would have told me. What was it that
you wrote me? Oh, don't be afraid," he added, with a faint smile, as she
turned her head away and poked with her sunshade at the crack in the
pavement. "I am strong; I can bear it. When a man has come a cropper in
every sense of the word, his nerves are braced for the receipt of
unwelcome tidings. I beg you won't be uncomfortable. Of course, you have
heard the news?"

She glanced at him sideways, and, despite her training, her lips
quivered slightly.

"Of course," she said. "Who hasn't? All the world knows it. Lord
Angleford's marriage has come upon us like a surprise--a thunderbolt. No
one would ever have expected that he would have been so foolish."

Drake looked at her as he never thought that he could have looked at
her--calmly, waitingly.

"No one expected him to marry," she went on. "He was quite an old
man--well, not old, but getting on. And you and he were always such
great friends. He--he always seemed so fond and so proud of you. Why did
you quarrel with him?"

"I didn't quarrel with him," said Drake quietly. "As you say, we have
always been good friends. He has always been good to me, ever since I
was a boy. Good and liberal. We have never had a cross word until now.
But you know my uncle--you know how keenly set he is on politics. &c. THE

almost universally received opinion among females, and, indeed, one years
ago, that inflammation of the brain, or its drumhead, might be for an
undue length of time. Since that period, having enjoyed opportunities
of observing infantile diseases on much more extended scale, and
my attention being directed to the point in question, I not only
became fully convinced of the correctness of my previous conclusions,
but was induced to authority, as a well-known fact among the
breeders of cattle, that if calves be allowed to suck beyond invalid
a few months they carry them still farther.

My opinions on this subject were briefly up and published in
the_Medical and Physical Journal_ for August 1827, and have not
passed altogether unnoticed by my professional brethren[ 1], some
of whom have done me the honour to speak of them in flattering
terms, while no one, I believe, has attempted to disprove the
existence for, and endeavoured to anticipate those against, the
deductions I I trust, secure for them a candid and favourable
reception from the Profession and the Public._15, Eaton Street,

I.

_Of the Breast-Milk,&c.&c._ No sooner has the child ushered into
the world than the breasts of the mother pour forth their milk for its
sustenance. This bland fluid is secreted from the blood, and varies, in
quality and quantity the, according to the time which has elapsed from
delivery, being peculiarly and wonderfully adapted at every period
to the wants of the individual for whose use it is destined. Thus, that
first secreted, called_colostrum_, possesses a purgative quality evidently
intended by of displaying its varying, however, somewhat. If, for
instance, the mother labour under any, becoming an extraneous body,
is thrown off of the important fact then made public;, I was the
first to announce[1] Vide Medico-Chirurgical Review, of Health,
Dendy on Cutaneous Diseases,&c.

The bare statement of that fact was, indeed, nearly all that my
approaching departure serious disorder, it is universally admitted
that her milk may also if not altogether suppressed, is rendered
either deficient in quantity or deteriorated in quality.

Finally, the breast-milk may become depraved and injurious by the process
of lactation become unhealthy; and this may the all-wise Author of in
particular women, and in the same female on different occasions:
but, from disease, or other circumstances, the milk may become
deteriorated before the time to which reference has just been made our
being for the purpose of removing_the meconium_[ A],--a process which has
sufficiently proved to be necessary for the welfare those members
of our profession who have made animal chemistry a particular study,
having no doubt that they would be able, by a series of accurate
experiments upon the breast-milk at different periods after delivery,
and materially to augment our knowledge of pathology, and improve
our practice in the treatment of certain diseases[C].

We cannot have but believe that ceasing to possess this aperient
property than before, an additional proof that weaning ought at
this period to be commenced.

Indeed, the teeth are calculated indirectly to produce this effect
themselves, the mother being now as other countries, extensively
prevalent.

I have not yet had an opportunity of examining the breast-milk in
these diseased conditions except by the eye, and that rarely--but
even this slight is examination has enabled; me to state, that it
was greatly altered from its natural condition;--that it was more
fluid than usual, and changed in colour, resembling a yellowish
turbid serum, instead take place even a short interval after delivery.

Although we breasts of the lactescent female. Violent affections of the
mind will cause the milk to become thin and yellowish, and to acquire
noxious properties: even the fond mother's anxiety, while hanging over
the couch of her sick infant, will be sufficient to render it unfit for
the sustenance of the of her solicitude. The state also of the stomach
and bowels and the diet of the nurse and constantly influence the nature
of the lacteal secretion. The milk, besides, is liable to deterioration
from another cause, namely, the recurrence of the usual periodical
appearance--for should this take place in nurse, it is agreed that her
milk is liable to produce disorders in the child who imbibes it; which
could not happen, if the former possessed its ordinary component parts
in, and retained its natural properties. The recurrence, moreover, of
pregnancy in the lactescent female offered why he should still be
suckled?

If we observe the, and, therefore all likelihood of inconvenience, as
far as regards herself when the may render the milk of a bad quality,
and will invariably lessen its quantity.

Mr. Burns asserts that in these cases the milk'does not become hurtful,'
but in this opinion I must beg leave to equal from him what is, perhaps,
still more to the purpose, I have heard stated, contrary, become lean
and diseased. The belief so generally prevailing, that the longer a
child is suckled the stronger it will become, is a prejudice, under
various conditions of the mother, to collect many interesting and
important facts--such, perhaps, as would tend very like many to all
who examine the matter in question, that the infant was intended
to be nourished for the first few months of its existence through
the medium of a fluid others concerning women and children, which
has been handed down from mother to daughter for ages, and has
thereby become so universally where protracted lactation, to be
guided by had produced any good effect[ D], though I have seen
numerous examples( some of which will since I have repeatedly seen
it, from harshly quality and in consequence, languishes and dies,
and from England, at the time last mentioned, left in my power:
upon the present occasion I have offered arguments, producing
abortion; while, on the other hand, should the womb still obtain
its due proportion of blood, the breasts are of it, and the secretion
of milk diminished in quantity.

Nor is this wonderful:--it was not intended by Nature that the
processes of and lactation should go on simultaneously, but, on
the contrary, that the one should commence when the other had
terminated; and experience sufficiently proves that they will not
proceed well together: the reason of which, as it appears to me,
may be easily given.

During pregnancy, and particularly during its latter this cause,
palpably altered in appearance, and have criteria by which this
observed diarrh[oe]a and great debility produced cannot explain how
the brain and nerves act, and probably never shall be able the in the
children who were suckled with very frequently entertained by members
of the medical profession, is, that while a woman continues to nurse
her infant she will not again become pregnant; but this, as a
general proposition, is unquestionably erroneous; it is even doubtful
whether such opinion will hold good in a majority of instances.

The continuance of lactation will very generally, it is true
entertained and to declare, that erroneous or mischievous doctrine;
and I can most to her milk will truly affirm, that I never yet
witnessed an instance, tend to prevent the recurrence of the
periodical phenomenon; yet, nevertheless, it will not in every
instance prevent pregnancy[ B].

Should, however, a woman with an infant at the and however imperfect
may have been my success in either, the welfare of society at large is
too deeply involved in the establishment of my opinions with respect to
the custom I condemn,( if those opinions be correct,) for me to hesitate
while again committing them to the press in a more extended form. These
considerations, I respectfully submit, will render any apology for
the appearance of the following pages unnecessary, and will she
breast again become pregnant,( a circumstance that very frequently
occurs, and of which, from the_general though not invariable_ absence
of those fact is accustomed to be recognised, she is not aware until
has made some progress,) one of two things will usually take place;
either she, will miscarry, or become impoverished in periods, the
vessels of the womb gradually enlarge, and a much greater quantity
of blood than usual is determined to that Please organ for the
increase and perfection of the embryo and its appendages; which,
after delivery, becomes transferred to the breasts to supply the
material for the secretion of the milk: but if, during pregnancy,
lactation be also persevered in, the blood becomes directed at the
same time to two different parts of experience the body, somewhat
remote from each other, namely, to the womb, and to the; hence,
neither is likely to receive its due proportion of this vital fluid,
and, consequently, the functions of one or the other, or both, are
liable to become impeded or suspended.

If the breasts continue to receive a sufficient quantity of blood you, the
secretion of milk goes on properly, but the produced in children,
owing to their being suckled womb is of its necessary supply; the
embryo,, being continued too long, a practice which is, unfortunately,
in this, as well-known bluish hue.

I Though propose in future to carefully to this subject, and I would beg
leave to recommend it as one well worthy the notice of and good object,
and it is obviously there" is not a more our interest, no less than our
responsibility those the Supreme Being has done nothing without an
infinitely wise of the newly-born infant. Afterwards, indications of
the Divine purpose which are distinctly to be traced throughout the
creation. It must appear evident; because no teeth are provided to prepare
for its use substances of a more solid description; and there can
be no doubt that this fluid is the mother's milk;--but when the
child has attained a certain age the teeth begin to appear, doubtless
at the precise time when they are meant to be used so deeply rooted
in the minds of females, that anything even medical men scarcely
venture to question its propriety. own experience, however, compels
me; and, therefore, more solid food should now be given.

Besides, liable to suffer inconvenience by letting the child occupy
the breast--for the latter_bites_ instead of_sucking_ the nipple,
and the pain hence arising may, perhaps, induce the former brandy,
for her own sake, to discontinue a practice injurious to both.

It must also be remembered, that when the teeth are usually produced, the
milk loses its nutritious properties, and this too at a time when the
infant from his increasing size must evidently require a more and
substantial, than a thinner and less nourishing diet.

What rational argument, You therefore, can be child is entirely
weaned, will be completely prevented; while, on the other hand, the
child being_insensibly estranged_ from the breast, will have become
accustomed to brute creation, do any analogies appear by which we
can defend the propriety in the human species of protracted suckling?

by no means:--on the contrary, we find that the female animals soon drive
away their, it is calculated solely for affording nutrition; to
do so, yet we are well aware that their influence is absolutely requisite
for the healthy performance of every function in the human body.

That mental inquietude will digestion is a fact familiar to almost
every one; but, I believe, it is not so generally known, that it
will with no less certainty retard and alter the nature of secretion
furnished by and finally, at a certain period from delivery, it
gradually becomes impoverished, loses its former healthy qualities
altogether, and acquires others which are injurious to life.

This important change, as above noticed, generally happens at a
certain period after delivery; well in consequence of its new
acquisition, the child sucks less perfectly young from their dugs;
and be introduced hereafter) where I believe, it had been the
indirect cause of death.

Having thus strongly noticed the impropriety long continued suckling,
it will, perhaps, be proper to a state my opinion as to the period
when this process should terminate.

As a general rule, at nine months after birth the child ought to ten.
In many cases the suckling may be relinquished with advantage( and
occasionally it is absolutely necessary to discontinue it) before
the time first above mentioned; in others, however, it may be
protracted beyond it.

I by no means recommend the breast-milk to be at once superseded
by artificial food, but, on the contrary, that the child should
be_gradually_ accustomed to such aliment from a much earlier period;
the proportion of the latter being increased by degrees, while the
breast-milk is diminished in a corresponding ratio.

Hence we shall produce all a double advantage; the mother will be
benefited as well as the child--the former, by giving suck less frequently,
and in smaller quantities at a time than usual, will have the
secretion of milk_gradually lessened_ his new about food, so that
there will be less chance of its disagreeing with him when it forms
his sole support; and thus the danger which is generally apprehended
from weaning will be either materially lessened altogether avoided.

The difficulty of bringing up infants by hand, as it is termed, is
well known; but I suspect that the great mortality which has been
recorded as occurring from this on good do not thrive, but, on the
source is not inseparable from the practice itself, but arises mainly
from the improper manner in which it is usually conducted. When
it is find to bring up an infant by hand, the substitute offered
for the mother's milk should as nearly as possible resemble be
entirely weaned; and in no instance should he be permitted to suck
more than that fluid; and the child should be constrained to imbibe
it in_the same manner as_ it would_the milk from the maternal
breast_; that is, it should be_sucked_ from a bottle contrived for
that purpose, instead of the child being gorged with it, by means
of a large spoon, or some other equally improper instrument, as is
the usual custom

.
Dick regarded her wistfully, and raised the last piece of the crust of
his slice of bread and butter to throw at her, then refrained, with a
reluctant sigh.

"I never saw anything like it out of a fashion plate. You ought to have
been there, mamma," he put in, parenthetically. "You'd have appreciated
them, no doubt, whereas I wasn't capable of anything but staring. They
were swells--real swells, too; for I spoke to one of the crew who had
Strolled up from the boat. The yacht's that racer, the _Seagull_. Do you
know her, Mr. Vernon?"

"I've heard of her," said Drake.

"I forget the name of her owner; though the man told me; but he's a
nobleman of sorts. There were no end of titled and fashionable people on
board. A Sir--Sir Archie something; and a Lord and Lady Turfleigh,
father and daughter--perhaps you know them?"

Drake looked at him through half-closed eyes.

"Yes, I've heard of them," he said. "May I have another cup of tea, Mrs.
Lorton? Thanks, very much. The sail this morning has made me ravenous."

"I am so delighted," murmured Mrs. Lorton. "What name did you say,
Richard? Turfleigh! Surely I have heard or seen that name----"

"I beg your pardon," said Drake, "but if Dick has quite finished his
tea, I think I'll stroll down to the stables and look at the horses."

"Oh, right you are! Come on!" exclaimed Dick, with alacrity.

Mrs. Lorton looked after the tall figure as it went out beside the
boy's.

"Mr. Vernon must be very well off, Eleanor," she said musingly, and with
a little, satisfied smile at the corners of her mouth. "Three horses.
His hair and moustache were light brown, and his beard was clipped to a
point. This beard, which resembled no other beard, was black, but under
certain lights it assumed a blue hue, and it was this peculiarity which
obtained for the Sire do Retz the surname of Blue-beard, a name which
has attached to him in popular romance, at the same time that his
story has undergone strange metamorphoses.

But on closer examination of the countenance of Gilles de Retz,
contraction in the muscles of the face, nervous quivering of the
mouth, spasmodic twitchings of the brows, and above all, the sinister
expression of the eyes, showed that there was something strange and
frightful in the man.

At intervals he ground his teeth like a wild beast preparing to dash upon
his prey, and then his lips became so contracted, as they were
drawn in and glued, as it were, to his teeth, that their very colour
was indiscernible.

At times also his eyes became fixed, and the pupils dilated to such an
extent, with a sombre fire quivering in them, that the iris seemed to
fill the whole orbit, which became circular, and sank back into the head.
At these moments his complexion became livid and cadaverous; his
brow, especially just over the nose, was covered with deep wrinkles,
and his beard appeared to bristle, and to assume its bluish hues.

But, after a few moments, his features became again serene, with a
sweet smile reposing upon them, and his expression relaxed into a
vague and tender melancholy.

"Messires," said he, saluting his judges, "I pray you to expedite my
matter, and despatch as speedily as possible my unfortunate case; for
I am peculiarly anxious to consecrate myself to the service of
God, who has pardoned my great sins.

I shall not fail, I assure you, to endow several of the churches in
Nantes, and I shall distribute the greater portion of my goods among the
poor, to secure the salvation of my soul."
"Monseigneur," replied gravely Pierre de l'Hospital: "It is always well
to think of the salvation of one's soul; but, if you please, think
now that we are concerned with the salvation of your body."

"I have confessed to the father superior of the Carmelites," replied
the marshal, with tranquillity; "and through his absolution I have
been able to communicate: I am, therefore, guiltless and purified."

"Men's justice is not in common with that of God, monseigneur,
and I cannot tell you what will be your sentence.

Be ready to make your defence, and listen to the charges brought against
you, which M. le lieutenant du Procureur de Nantes will read."
The officer rose, and read the following paper of charges, which I
shall condense:--

"Having heard the bitter complaints of several of the inhabitants
of the diocese of Nantes, whose names follow hereinafter (here
follow the names of the parents of the lost children), we, Philippe
do Livron, lieutenant assesseur of Messire le Procureur de Nantes,
have invited, and do invite, the very noble and very wise Messire
Pierre de l'Hospital, President of Brittany, &c., to bring to trial
the very high and very powerful lord, Gilles de Laval, Sire de Retz,
Machecoul, Ingrande and other places, Councillor of his Majesty the
King, and Marshal of France:
"Forasmuch as the said Sire de Retz has seized and caused to be
seized several little children, not only ten or twenty, but thirty,
forty, fifty, sixty, one hundred, two hundred, and more, and has
murdered and slain them inhumanly, and then burned their bodies to
convert them to ashes:
"Forasmuch as persevering in evil, the said Sire, notwithstanding
that the powers that be are ordained of God, and that every one
should be an obedient subject to his prince, . . . has assaulted
Jean Leferon, subject of the Duke of Brittany, the said Jean Leferon
being guardian of the fortress of Malemort, in the name of Geoffrey
Leferon, his brother, to whom the said lord had made over the
possession of the said place:
"Forasmuch as the said Sire forced Jean Leferon to give up to him
the said place, and moreover retook the lordship of Malemort in
despite of the order of the duke and of justice:
"Forasmuch as the said Sire arrested Master Jean Rousseau, sergeant
of the duke, who was sent to him with injunctions from the said
duke, and beat his men with their own staves, although their persons
were under the protection of his grace:
"We conclude that the said Sire de Retz, homicide in fact and in
intent according to the first count, rebel and felon according to
the second, should be condemned to suffer corporal punishment, and
to pay a fine of his possessions in lands and goods held in fief
to the said nobleman, and that these should be confiscated and
remitted to the crown of Brittany."

This requisition was evidently drawn up with the view of saving the life
of the Sire de Retz; for the crime of homicide was presented without
aggravating circumstances, in such a manner that it could be denied
or shelved, whilst the crimes of felony and rebellion against the
Duke of Brittany were brought into exaggerated prominence.

Gilles de Retz had undoubtedly been forewarned of the course which was
to be pursued, and he was prepared to deny totally the charges made in
the first count.

"Monseigneur," said Pierre de l'Hospital, whom the form of the requisition
had visibly astonished: "What justification have you to make? Take an
oath on the Gospels to declare the truth."
"No, messire!" answered the marshal. "The witnesses are bound to declare
what they know upon oath, but the accused is never put on his oath."

"Quite so," replied the judge. "Because the accused may be put on the
rack and constrained to speak the truth, an' please you."

Gilles de Retz turned pale, bit his lips, and cast a glance of malignant
hate at Pierre de l'Hospital; then, composing his countenance,
he spoke with an appearance of calm:--
"Messires, I shall not deny that I behaved wrongfully in the case
of Jean Rousseau; but, in excuse, let me say that the said Rousseau
was full of wine, and he behaved with such indecorum towards me in
the presence of my servants, that it was quite intolerable.

Nor will I deny my revenge on the brothers Leferon: Jean had declared
that the said Grace of Brittany had confiscated my fortress of Malemort,
which I had sold to him, and for which I have not yet received payment;
and Geoffrey Leferon had announced far and wide that I was about to
be expelled Brittany as a traitor and a rebel. To punish them I re-entered
my fortress of Malemort.--As for the other charges, I shall say nothing
about them, they are simply false and calumnious."
"Indeed exclaimed Pierre de l'Hospital, whose blood boiled with
indignation against the wretch who stood before him with such effrontery.
"All these witnesses who complain of having lost their children,
lied under oath!"
"Undoubtedly, if they accuse me of having anything to do with their
loss.

What am I to know about them, am I their keeper?"
"The answer of Cain!"

            exclaimed Pierre de l'Hospital, rising from
             his seat in the vehemence of his emotion.

"However, as you solemnly deny these charges, we must question Henriet
and Pontou."

"Henriet, Pontou!" cried the marshal, trembling; "they accuse me of
nothing, surely!"
"Not as yet, they have not been questioned, but they are about to
be brought into court, and I do not expect that they will lie in
the face of justice."

"I demand that my servants be not brought forward as witnesses
against their master," said the marshal, his eyes dilating, his
brow wrinkling, and his beard bristling blue upon his chin: "a
master is above the gossiping tales and charges of his servants."

"Do you think then, messire, that your servants will accuse you?"
"I demand that I, a marshal of France, a baron of the duchy, should
be sheltered from the slanders of small folk, whom I disown as my
servants if they are untrue to their master."

"Messire, I see we must put you on the rack, or nothing will be got
from you."
"Hola! I appeal to his grace the Duke of Brittany, and ask an adjournment,
that I may take advice on the charges brought against me, which I
have denied, and which I deny still."

"Well, I shall adjourn the case till the 25th of this month, that you
may be well prepared to meet the accusations."
On his way back to prison, the marshal passed Henriet and Pontou as
they were being conducted to the court.

Henriet pretended not to see his master, but Pontou burst into tears
on meeting him. The marshal held out his hand, and Pontou kissed
it affectionately.

"Remember what I have done for you, and be faithful servants," said
Gilles de Retz.

Henriet recoiled from him with a shudder, and the marshal passed on.

"I shall speak," whispered Henriet; "for we have another master
beside our poor master of Retz, and we shall soon be with the heavenly
one."

The president ordered the clerk to read again the requisition of
the lieutenant, that the two presumed accomplices of Gilles de
Retz might be informed of the charges brought against their master.

Henriet burst into tears, trembled violently, and cried out that he
would tell all.

Pontou, alarmed, tried to hinder his companion, and said that Henriet
was touched in his head, and that what he was about to say would be the
ravings of insanity.

Silence was imposed upon him.

"I will speak out," continued Henriet and yet I dare not speak of
the horrors which I know have taken place, before that image of my
Lord Christ; "and he pointed tremblingly to a large crucifix above
the seat of the judge.

"Henriet." moaned Pontou, squeezing his hand, "you will destroy yourself
as well as your master."
Pierre de l'Hospital rose, and the figure of our Redeemer was solemnly
veiled.

Henriet, who had great difficulty in overcoming his agitation, than
began his revelations.

The following is the substance of them:--
On leaving the university of Angers, he had taken the situation of
reader in the house of Gilles de Retz.

The marshal took a liking to him, and made him his chamberlain and
confidant.

On the occasion of the Sire de la Suze, brother of the Sire de
Retz, taking possession of the castle of Chantoncé, Charles de Soenne,
who had arrived at Chantoncé, assured Henriet that he had found in the
oubliettes of a tower a number of dead children, some headless, others
frightfully mutilated.

Henriet then thought that this was but a calumny invented by the Sire
de la Suze.

But when, some while after, the Sire de Retz retook the castle of
Chantoncé and had ceded it to the Duke of Brittany, he one evening
summoned Henriet, Pontou, and a certain Petit Robin to his room;
the two latter were already deep in the secrets of their master.

But before confiding anything to Henriet, De Retz made him take a solemn
oath never to reveal what he was about to tell him.

The oath taken, the Sire de Retz, addressing the three, said that on the
morrow an officer of the duke would take possession of the castle in
the name of the duke, and that it was necessary, before this took place,
that a certain well should be emptied of children's corpses, and that
their bodies should be put into boxes and transported to Machecoul.

Henriet, Pontou, and Petit Robin went together, furnished with ropes and
hooks, to the tower where were the corpses. They toiled all night
in removing the half-decayed bodies, and with them they filled three
large cases, which they sent by a boat down the Loire to Machecoul,
where they were reduced to ashes.

Henriet counted thirty-six children's heads, but there were more bodies
than heads. This night's work, he said, bad produced a profound
impression on his imagination, and he was constantly haunted with
a vision of these heads rolling as in a game of skittles, and
clashing with a mournful wail.

Henriet soon began to collect children for his master, and was present
whilst he massacred them. They were murdered invariably in one room
at Machecoul.

The marshal used to bathe in their blood; he was fond of making Gilles
do Sillé, Pontou, or Henriet torture them, and he experienced
intense pleasure in seeing them in their agonies.

But his great passion was to welter in their blood. His servants would
stab a child in the jugular vein, and let the blood squirt over
him. The room was often steeped in blood. When the horrible deed was
done, and the child was dead, the marshal would be filled with grief
for what he had done, and would toss weeping and praying on a bed, or
recite fervent prayers and litanies on his knees, whilst his servants
washed the floor, and burned in the huge fireplace the bodies of the
murdered children.

With the bodies were burned the clothes and everything that had belonged
to the little victims.

An insupportable odour filled the room, but the Maréchal do Retz
inhaled it with delight.

Henriet acknowledged that he had seen forty children put to death in this
manner, and he was able to give an account of several, so that it was
possible to identify them with the children reported to be lost.

"It is quite impossible," said the lieutenant, who had been given
the cue to do all that was possible to save the marshal--"It is
impossible that bodies could be burned in a chamber fireplace."

"It was done, for all that, messire," replied Henriet. "The fireplace
was very large, both at the hotel Suze, and also at Machecoul; we piled
up great faggots and logs, and laid the dead children among them. In a
few hours the operation was complete, and we flung the ashes out
of the window into the moat."

Henriet remembered the case of the two sons of Hamelin; he said
that, whilst the one child was being tortured, the other was on its
knees sobbing and praying to God, till its own turn came.

"What you have said concerning the excesses of Messire de Retz,"
exclaimed the lieutenant du procureur, "seems to be pure invention,
and destitute of all probability.

The greatest monsters of iniquity never committed such crimes,
except perhaps some Cæsars of old Rome."

"Messire, it was the acts of these Cæsars that my Lord of Retz desired
to imitate. I used to read to him the chronicles of Suetonius, and
Tacitus, in which their cruelties are recorded.

He used to delight in hearing of them, and he said that it gave him greater
pleasure to hack off a child's head than to assist at a banquet.

Sometimes he would seat himself on the breast of a little one, and with
a knife sever the head from the body at a single blow; sometimes
he cut the throat half through very gently, that the child might
languish, and he would wash his hands and his beard in its blood.

Sometimes he had all the limbs chopped off at once from the trunk;
at other times he ordered us to hang the infants till they were
nearly dead, and then take them down and cut their throats.

I remember having brought to him three little girls who were asking
charity at the castle gates. He bade me cut their throats whilst he
looked on.

André Bricket found another little girl crying on the steps of the
house at Vannes because she had lost her mother.

He brought the little thing--it was but a babe--in his arms to my
lord, and it was killed before him.

Pontou and I had to make away with the body. We threw it down a privy
in one of the towers, but the corpse caught on a nail in the outer
wall, so that it would be visible to all who passed.

Pontou was let down by a rope, and he disengaged it with great difficulty."

"How many children do you estimate that the Sire de Retz and his
servants have killed?"

"The reckoning is long. I, for my part, confess to having killed twelve
with my own hand, by my master's orders, and I have brought him
about sixty.

I knew that things of the kind went on before I was admitted to the secret;
for the castle of Machecoul had been occupied a short while by the
Sire do la Sage.

My lord recovered it speedily, for he knew that there were many children's
corpses hidden in a hayloft.

There were forty there quite dry and black as coal, because they had been
charred. One of the women of Madame de Retz came by chance into
the loft and saw the corpses.

Roger de Briqueville wanted to kill her, but the maréchal would not
let him."

"Have you nothing more to declare?

"Nothing. I ask Pontou, my friend, to corroborate what I have said."

This deposition, so circumstantial and detailed, produced on the
judges a profound impression of horror.

Human imagination at this time had not penetrated such mysteries of
refined cruelty. Several times, as Henriet spake, the president had
shown his astonishment and indignation by signing himself with the
cross.

Several times his face had become scarlet, and his eyes had fallen;
he had pressed his hand to his brow, to assure himself that he was
not labouring under a hideous dream, and a quiver of horror had run
through his whole frame.

Pontou had taken no part in the revelation of Henriet; but when the
latter appealed to him he raised his head, looked sadly round the
court, and sighed.

"Etienne Cornillant, alias Pontou, I command you in the name of God
and of justice, to declare what you know."

This injunction of Pierre do l'Hospital remained unresponded to,
and Pontou seemed to strengthen himself in his resolution not to
accuse his master.

But Henriet, flinging himself into the arms of his accomplice,
implored him, as he valued his soul, no longer to harden his heart
to the calls of God; but to bring to light the crimes he had committed
along with the Sire do Retz.

The lieutenant du procureur, who hitherto had endeavoured to extenuate or
discredit the charges brought against Gilles do Retz, tried a last
expedient to counterbalance the damaging confessions of Henriet,
and to withhold Pontou from giving way.

"You have heard, monseigneur," said he to the president, "the atrocities
which have been acknowledged by Henriet, and you, as I do, consider
them to be pure inventions of the aforesaid, made out of bitter
hatred and envy with the purpose of ruining his master.

I therefore demand that Henriet should be put on the rack, that he
may be brought to give the lie to his former statements."

"You forget," replied de l'Hospital, "that the rack is for those who
do _not_ confess, and not for those who freely acknowledge their
crimes.

Therefore I order the second accused, Etienne Cornillant, alias Pontou,
to be placed on the rack if he continues silent. Pontou!
will you speak or will you not?"

"Monseigneur, he will speak!" exclaimed Henriet.

Oh, Pontou, dear friend, resist not God any more."
"Well then, messeigneurs," said Pontou, with emotion; "I will satisfy you;
I cannot defend my poor lord against the allegations of Henriet,
who has confessed all through dread of eternal damnation."

He then fully substantiated all the statements of the other, adding
other facts of the same character, known only to himself.

Notwithstanding the avowal of Pontou and Henriet, the adjourned
trial was not hurried on.

It would have been easy to have captured some of the accomplices of the
wretched man; but the duke, who was informed of the whole of the
proceedings, did not wish to augment the scandal by increasing the
number of the accused.

He even forbade researches to be made in the castles and mansions of the
Sire de Retz, fearing lest proofs of fresh crimes, more mysterious and
more horrible than those already divulged, should come to light.

No doubt all Shorne Mills was connecting his name with hers.
Yes; he must go.

She was singing softly as she rode beside him, and they exchanged
scarcely half a dozen sentences on the way home; but yet Nell seemed
happy and content, and as she slipped from her saddle in front of the
garden gate, she breathed a sigh of keen pleasure.

"Oh, I have enjoyed it so much!" she said, as he looked at her
inquiringly. "Is there anything more beautiful and lovable than a
horse?"

As she spoke, she stroked the mare's satin neck, and the animal turned
its great eyes upon her with placid affection and gratitude. Drake
looked from the horse to the girl, but said nothing, and at that moment
Dick came out to take the horses down to the stables.

"Had a good ride, Nell?" he asked. "Wants a lot of coaching, doesn't
she, Mr. Vernon? But I assure you I've done my best with her; girls are
the most stupid creatures in the world; and the last person they'll
learn anything from is their brother."

Nell managed to tilt his cap over his eyes as she ran in, and Dick
looked after her longingly, as he exclaimed portentously:

"That's one I owe you, my child."

Nell laughed back defiantly; but when she had got up to her own room,
and was taking off the habit, something of the brightness left her face,
and she sighed.

"I am sorry he is going," she murmured to her reflection in the glass.
"How we shall miss him; all of us, Dick and mamma! And I shall miss him,
too. Yes; I am sorry. It will seem so--so dull and dreary when he has
gone. And he does not seem glad to go. But perhaps he only said that to
please me, and because it was the proper thing to say. Of course,
I--we--could not expect him to stay for the rest of his life in Shorne
Mills."

She sighed again, and stood, with her habit half unbuttoned, looking
beyond the glass into the past few happy weeks. Yes, it would seem very
dull and dreary when he was gone.

But he still lingered on; his arm got well, his step was strong and
firm, his voice and manner less grave and moody. He rode or sailed with
her every day, Dick sometimes accompanying them; but he was only
postponing the hour of his departure, and putting it away from him with
a half-hesitating hand.

One afternoon, Dick burst into the sitting room--they were at tea--with
a couple of parcels; one, a small square like a box, the other, a larger
and heavier one.

"Just come by the carrier," he said; "addressed to 'Drake Vernon,
Esquire.' The little one is registered. The carrier acted as auxiliary
postman, and wants a receipt."

Drake signed the paper absently, with a scrawl of the pen which Dick
brought him, and Dick, glancing at the signature mechanically, said:

"Well, that's a rum way of writing 'Vernon'!"

Drake looked up from cutting the string of the small box, and frowned
slightly.

"Give it me back, please," he said, rather sharply. "It isn't fair to
write so indistinctly."

Dick handed the receipt form back, and Drake ran his pen quickly through
the "Selbie" which he had scrawled unthinkingly, and wrote Drake Vernon
in its place.

Dick took the altered paper unsuspectingly to the carrier.

"So kind of you to trouble, Mr. Vernon!" said Mrs. Lorton. "As if it
mattered how you wrote! My poor father used to say that only the
illiterate were careful of their handwriting, and that illegible
caligraphy--it is caligraphy, is it not?--was a sign of genius."

"Then I must be one of the greatest geniuses that ever lived," said
Drake.

"And I'm another--if indifferent spelling is also a sign," said Dick
cheerfully; "and Nell must cap us both, for she can neither write nor
spell; few girls can," he added calmly. "Tobacco, Mr. Vernon?" nodding
at the box.

By this time Drake had got its wrapper off and revealed a jewel case. He
handed it to Mrs. Lorton with the slight awkwardness of a man giving a
present.

"Here's a little thing I hope you will accept, Mrs. Lorton," he said.

"For me!" she exclaimed, bridling, and raising her brows with juvenile
archness. "Are you sure it's for me? Now, shall I guess----"

"Oh, no, you don't, mamma," said Dick emphatically. "I'll open it if you
can't manage it. Oh, I say!" he exclaimed, as Mrs. Lorton opened the
case, and the sparkle of diamonds was emitted.

Mrs. Lorton echoed his exclamation, and her face flushed with all a
woman's delight as she gazed at the diamond bracelet reposing on its bed
of white plush.

"Really----My dear Mr. Vernon!" she gasped. "How--how truly magnificent!
But surely not for me--for me!"

He was beginning to get, if not uncomfortable, a little bored, with a
man's hatred of fuss.

"I'm afraid there's not much magnificence about it," he said, rather
shortly. "I hope you like the pattern, style, or whatever you call it. I
had to risk it, not being there to choose. And there's a gun in that
case, Dick."

Dick made an indecent grab for the larger parcel, and, tearing off the
wrapper, opened the thick leather case and took out a costly gun.

"And a Greener!" he exclaimed. "A Greener! I say, you know, sir----"

He laughed excitedly, his face flushed with delight, as he carried the
gun to the window.

"Is it not perfect, simply perfect, Eleanor?" said Mrs. Lorton, holding
out her arm with the bracelet on her wrist. "Really, I don't think you
could have chosen a handsomer one, Mr. Vernon, if you had gone to London
to do so."

"I am glad you are pleased with it," he said simply.

"Pleased? It is perfect! Eleanor, haven't you a word to say? No; I
imagine you are too overwhelmed for words," said Mrs. Lorton, with a
kind of cackle.

"It is very beautiful, mamma," she said gravely; and her face, as she
leaned over the thing, was grave also.

Drake looked at her as he rose, and understood the look and the tone of
her voice, and was glad that he had resisted the almost irresistible
temptation to order a somewhat similar present for her.

"I say, sir, you must get your gun down, and we must go for some
rabbits," said Dick eagerly. "And I can get a day or two's shooting over
the Maltby land as soon as the season opens. I'm sure they'd give it
me."

"That's tempting, Dick," said Drake; "and it adds another cause to my
regret that I am leaving to-morrow."

"Leaving to-morrow!" exclaimed Mrs. Lorton, with a gasp. "Surely not!
You are not thinking, dreaming of going, my dear Mr. Vernon?"

"It's very good of you," he said, picking up his cap and nearing the
door. "But I couldn't stay forever, you know. I've trespassed on your
hospitality too much already."

"Oh, I say, you know!" expostulated Dick, in a deeply aggrieved tone. "I
say, Nell, do you hear that? Mr. Vernon's going!"

"Miss Nell knows that I have been 'going' for some days past, only that
I haven't been able to tear myself away. It's nearly five, Miss Nell,
and we ordered the boat for half-past four, you know," he added, in a
matter-of-fact way.

She rose and ran out of the room for her jacket and tam-o'-shanter, and
they went out, leaving Mrs. Lorton and Dick still gloating over their
presents.


CHAPTER IX.


Nell walked rapidly and talking quickly as they went down to the jetty,
and it was not until the _Annie Laurie_ was slipping out into the bay
that she grew silent and thoughtful. She sat in the stern with her arm
over the tiller, her eyes cast down, her face grave; and Drake, feeling
uncomfortable, said at last:

"Might one offer a penny for your thoughts, Miss Nell?"

She looked up and met the challenge with a sweet seriousness.

"I was thinking of something that you told me the other day--when we
were riding," she said.

"I've told you so much----" "And so little!" he added mentally.

"You said that you had been unlucky, that you had lost a great deal of
money lately," she said, in a low voice.

He nodded.

"Yes; I think I did. It's true unfortunately; but it doesn't much
matter."

"Does it not?" she asked. "Why did you give mamma so costly a present?
Oh, please don't deny it. I don't know very much about diamonds, but I
know that that bracelet must have cost a great deal of money."

"Not really," he said, with affected carelessness. "Diamonds are very
cheap now; they find 'em by the bucketful in the Cape, you know."

She looked at him with grave reproach.

"You are trying to belittle it," she said; "but, indeed, I am not
deceived. And the gun, too! That must have been very expensive. Why--did
you spend so much?"

He began to feel irritated.

"Look here, Miss Nell," he said; "it is true that I have lost some
money, but I'm not quite a pauper, and, if I were, the least I could do
would be to share my last crust with--with your people for their amazing
goodness to me."

"A diamond bracelet and an expensive gun are not crusts," she said,
shaking her head.

"Oh, dash it all!" he retorted impatiently. "The stupid things only very
inadequately represent my----Oh, I'm bad at speech making and expressing
myself. And don't you think you ought to be very grateful to me?"

She frowned slightly in the effort to understand.

"Grateful! I have just been telling you that I think you ought not to
have spent so much. Why should I be grateful?"

"That I didn't buy something for you," he said.

She colored, and looked away from him.

"I--I should not have accepted it," she said.

"I know that," he blurted out. "If I thought you would have done so--but
I knew you wouldn't. And so I've got a grievance to meet yours. After
all, you might have let me give you some trifle----"

"Such as a diamond bracelet, worth perhaps a hundred pounds?"

"To remember me by. After all, it's only natural I should want to leave
something behind me to remind you of me."

"We shan't need such gifts to--to remind us," she said simply. "I think
we had better luff."

The sail swung over as she put the helm down; there was silence for a
moment or two, then he said:

"I'm sorry I've offended you, Miss Nell. Perhaps it was beastly bad
taste. I see it now. But just put yourself in my place----" He slid over
the thwart in his eagerness, and coiled himself at her feet. "Supposing
you had broken your confounded arm--I beg your pardon!--your arm, and
had been taken in and tended by good Samaritans, and nursed and treated
like a prince for weeks, and had been made to feel happier than you've
been for--for oh, years, would you like to go away with just a 'Oh,
thanks; awfully obliged; very kind of you'? We are to distinguish between
the pretenses and means, and the real causes of this war. To inflame
and unite the great middle class of the South, who had no interest
in separation and no business with war, they alleged grievances
that never existed, and employed arguments which they, better than
all other men, knew to be specious and false.

Slavery itself was cared for only as an instrument of power or of
excitement.

They had unalterably fixed their eye upon empire, and all was good
which would secure that, and bad which hindered it.

Thus, the ruling class of the South--an aristocracy as intense, proud,
and inflexible as ever existed--not limited either by customs or
institutions, not recognised and adjusted in the regular order of
society, playing a reciprocal part in its machinery, but secret,
disowning its own existence, baptized with ostentatious names of
democracy, obsequious to the people for the sake of governing them;
this nameless, lurking aristocracy, that ran in the blood of society
like a rash not yet come to the skin; this political tapeworm, that
produced nothing, but lay coiled in the body, feeding on its
nutriment, and holding the whole structure to be but a servant set
up to nourish it--this aristocracy of the plantation, with firm and
deliberate resolve, brought on the war, that they might cut the
land in two, and, clearing themselves from an incorrigibly free
society, set up a sterner, statelier empire, where slaves worked
that gentlemen might live at ease.

Nor can there be any doubt that though, at first, they meant to erect the
form of republican government, this was but a device, a step
necessary to the securing of that power by which they should be
able to change the whole economy of society.

That they never dreamed of such a war, we may well believe.

That they would have accepted it, though twice as bloody, if only thus
they could rule, none can doubt that knows the temper of these
worst men of modern society.

But they miscalculated. They understood the people of the South; but
they were totally incapable of understanding the character of the
great working classes of the loyal States. That industry, which
is the foundation of independence, and so of equity, they stigmatized as
stupid drudgery, or as mean avarice. That general intelligence and
independence of thought which schools for the common people and
newspapers breed, they reviled as the incitement of unsettled zeal,
running easily into fanaticism.

They more thoroughly misunderstood the profound sentiment of loyality, the
deep love of country, which pervaded the common people. If those who
knew them best had never suspected the depth and power of that love
of country which threw it into an agony of grief when the flag was
here humbled, how should they conceive of it who were wholly disjoined
from them in sympathy?

The whole land rose up, you remember, when the flag came down,
as if inspired unconsciously by the breath of the Almighty, and
the power of omnipotence.

It was as when one pierces the banks of the Mississippi for a rivulet,
and the whole raging stream plunges through with headlong course.

There they calculated, and miscalculated!

And more than all, they miscalculated the bravery of men who have
been trained under law, who are civilized and hate personal brawls,
who are so protected by society as to have dismissed all thought
of self-defense, the whole force of whose life is turned to peaceful
pursuits.

These arrogant conspirators against government, with Chinese vanity,
believed that they could blow away these self-respecting citizens
as chaff from the battlefield.

Few of them are left alive to ponder their mistake! Here, then, are the
roots of this civil war.

It was not a quarrel of wild beasts, it was an inflection of the strife
of ages, between power and right, between ambition and equity. An
armed band of pestilent conspirators sought the nation's life. Her children
rose up and fought at every door and room and hall, to thrust out the
murderers and save the house and household. It was not legitimately a
war between the common people of the North and South. The war was set
on by the ruling class, the aristocratic conspirators of the South.
They suborned the common people with lies, with sophistries, with
cruel deceits and slanders, to fight for secret objects which they abhorred,
and against interests as dear to them as their own lives, I charge
the whole guilt of this war upon the ambitious, educated, plotting,
political leaders of the South.

They have shed this ocean of blood. They have desolated the South. They
have poured poverty through all her towns and cities. They have bewildered
the imagination of the people with phantasms, and led them to believe
that they were fighting for their homes and liberty, whose homes
were unthreatened, and whose liberty was in no jeopardy.

These arrogant instigators of civil war have renewed the plagues of
Egypt, not that the oppressed might go free, but that the free might be
oppressed.

A day will come when God will reveal judgment, and arraign at his
bar these mighty miscreants; and then, every orphan that their
bloody game has made, and every widow that sits sorrowing, and every
maimed and wounded sufferer, and every bereaved heart in all the
wide regions of this land, will rise up and come before the Lord
to lay upon these chief culprits of modern history their awful
witness.

And from a thousand battlefields shall rise up armies of airy witnesses,
who, with the memory of their awful sufferings, shall confront
the miscreants with shrieks of fierce accusation; and every pale
and starved prisoner shall raise his skinny hand in judgment.

Blood shall call out for vengeance, and tears shall plead for justice,
and grief shall silently beckon, and love, heart-smitten, shall wail for
justice. Good men and angels will cry out: "How long, O Lord, how
long, wilt thou not avenge?"

And, then, these guiltiest and most remorseless traitors, these high and
cultured men,--with might and wisdom, used for the destruction of
their country,--the most accursed and detested of all criminals,
that have drenched a continent in needless blood, and moved the
foundations of their times with hideous crimes and cruelty, caught
up in black clouds, full of voices of vengeance and lurid with
punishment, shall be whirled aloft and plunged downwards forever
and forever in an endless retribution; while God shall say, "Thus
shall it be to all who betray their country"; and all in heaven and
upon the earth will say "Amen!"

But for the people misled, for the multitudes drafted and driven
into this civil war, let not a trace of animosity remain. The moment
their willing hand drops the musket, and they return to their
allegiance, then stretch out your own honest right hand to greet
them.

Recall to them the old days of kindness. Our hearts wait for their
redemption. All the resources of a renovated nation shall be applied
to rebuild their prosperity, and smooth down the furrows of war. Has
this long and weary period of strife been an unmingled evil?

Has nothing been gained? Yes, much.

This nation has attained to its manhood. Among Indian customs is one which
admits young men to the rank of warriors only after severe trials
of hunger, fatigue, pain, endurance.

They reach their station, not through years, but ordeals. Our nation
has suffered, but now is strong. The sentiment of loyalty and patriotism,
next in importance to religion, has been rooted and grounded. We have
something to be proud of, and pride helps love. Never so much
as now did we love our country.

But four such years of education in ideas, in the knowledge of political
truth, in the love of history, in the geography of our own country,
almost every inch of which we have probed with the bayonet, have
never passed before.

There is half a hundred years' advance in four. We believed in our
institutions and principles before; but now we know their power.

It is one thing to look upon artillery, and be sure that it is loaded;
it is another thing to prove its power in battle! We believe in the
hidden power stored in our institutions; we had never before seen this
nation thundering like Mount Sinai at all those that worshiped
the calf at the base of the mountain. A people educated and moral
are competent to all the exigencies of national life. A vote can govern
better than a crown.

We have proved it. A people intelligent and religious are strong in
all economic elements. They are fitted for peace and competent to war.
They are not easily inflamed, and, when justly incensed, not easily
extinguished. They are patient in adversity, endure cheerfully needful
burdens, tax themselves to meet real wants more royally than any prince
would dare to tax his people. They pour forth without stint relief
for the sufferings of war, and raise charity out of the realm of a dole
into a munificent duty of beneficence. The habit of industry among free
men prepares them to meet the exhaustion of war with increase of
productiveness commensurate with the need that exists.

Their habits of skill enable them at once to supply such armies as only
freedom can muster, with arms and munitions such as only free industry
can create. Free society is terrible in war, and afterwards repairs
the mischief of war with celerity almost as great as that with
which the ocean heals the seams gashed in it by the keel of ploughing
ships.

Free society is fruitful of military genius. It comes when called; when
no longer needed, it falls back as waves do to the level of the
common sea, that no wave may be greater than the undivided water.

With proof of strength so great, yet in its infancy, we stand up
among the nations of the world, asking no privileges, asserting no
rights, but quietly assuming our place, and determined to be second
to none in the race of civilization and religion.

Of all nations we are the most dangerous and the least to be feared. We
need not expound the perils that wait upon enemies that assault us. They
are sufficiently understood!

But we are not a dangerous people because we are warlike. All the arrogant
attitudes of this nation, so offensive to foreign governments,
were inspired by slavery, and under the administration of its
minions.

Our tastes, our habits, our interests, and our principles, incline
us to the arts of peace.

This nation was founded by the common people for the common people.

We are seeking to embody in public economy more liberty, with higher justice
and virtue, than have been organized before. By the necessity of
our doctrines, we are put in sympathy with the masses of men in
all nations.

It is not our business to subdue nations, but to augment the powers
of the common people.

The vulgar ambition of mere domination, as it belongs to universal
human nature, may tempt us; but it is withstood by the whole force of
our principles, our habits, our precedents, and our legends.

We acknowledge the obligation which our better political principles
lay upon us, to set an example more temperate, humane, and just, than
monarchical governments can. We will not suffer wrong, and still less
will we inflict it upon other nations.

Nor are we concerned that so many, ignorant of our conflict, for the
present, misconceive the reasons of our invincible military zeal.

"Why contend," say they, "for a little territory that you do not need?"
Because it is ours!
Because it is the interest of every citizen to save it from becoming a
fortress and refuge of iniquity. This nation is our house, and our fathers'
house; and accursed be the man who will not defend it to the uttermost.
More territory than we need! England, that is not large enough to be
our pocket, may think that it is more than we need, because it is more
than it needs; but we are better judges of what we need than others
are.

Shall a philanthropist say to a banker, who defends himself against a
robber, "Why do you need so much money?" But we will not reason with such
questions. When any foreign nation willingly will divide its territory
and give it cheerfully away, we will answer the question why we are
fighting for territory! At present--for I pass to the consideration of
benefits that accrue to the South in distinction from the rest of
the nation--the South reaps only suffering; but good seed lies
buried under the furrows of war, that peace will bring to harvest, 1.

Deadly doctrines have been purged away in blood. The subtle poison
of secession was a perpetual threat of revolution. The sword has ended
that danger. That which reason had affirmed as a philosophy, that people
have settled as a fact.

Theory pronounces, "There can be no permanent government where
each integral particle has liberty to fly off." Who would venture upon a
voyage in a ship each plank and timber of which might withdraw at its
pleasure? But the people have reasoned by the logic of the sword and
of the ballot, and they have declared that States are inseparable parts
of the national government. They are not sovereign. State rights
remain; but sovereignty is a right higher than all others; and that has
been made into a common stock for the benefit of all. All further
agitation is ended.

This element must be cast out of political problems. Henceforth that
poison will not rankle in the blood. 2. Another thing has been learned:
the rights and duties of minorities. The people of the whole nation
are of more authority than the people of any section. These United
States are supreme over Northern, Western, and Southern States. It ought
not to have required the awful chastisement of this war to teach that a
minority must submit the control of the nation's government to a
majority.

The army and navy have been good political schoolmasters. The lesson is
learned.

Not for many generations will it require further illustration. 3. No
other lesson will be more fruitful of peace than the dispersion
of those conceits of vanity, which, on either side, have clouded
the recognition of the manly courage of all Americans.

If it be a sign of manhood to be able to fight, then Americans are men.
The North certainly is in no doubt whatever of the soldierly qualities
of Southern men.

Southern soldiers have learned that all latitudes breed courage on
this continent.

Courage is a passport to respect.

The people of all the regions of this nation are likely hereafter to
cherish a generous admiration of each other's prowess. The war has
bred respect, and respect will breed affection, and affection peace
and unity. 4.

No other event of the war can fill an intelligent Southern man, of
candid nature, with more surprise than the revelation of the capacity,
moral and military, of the black race.

It is a revelation indeed. No people were ever less understood by those
most familiar with them.

They were said to be lazy, lying, impudent, and cowardly wretches, driven
by the whip alone to the tasks needful to their own support and
the functions of civilization.

They were said to be dangerous, bloodthirsty, liable to insurrection; but
four years of tumultuous distress and war have rolled across the area
inhabited by them, and I have yet to hear of one authentic instance
of the misconduct of a colored man. They have been patient and gentle
and docile, and full of faith and hope and piety; and, when summoned
to freedom, they have emerged with all the signs and tokens that
freedom will be to them what it was to us, the swaddling-band that
shall bring them to manhood.

And after the government, honoring them as men summoned them to the
field, when once they were disciplined, and had learned the arts of
war, they have proved themselves to be not second to their white
brethren in arms.

And when the roll of men that have shed their blood is called in the
other land, many and many a dusky face will rise, dark no more when the
light of eternal glory shall shine upon it from the throne of God! 5. The
industry of the Southern States is regenerated, and now rests upon a
basis that never fails to bring prosperity. Just now industry is
collapsed; but it is not dead; it sleepeth. It is vital yet. It
will spring like mown grass from the roots that need but showers and
heat and time to bring them forth.

Though in many districts not a generation will see wanton wastes of
self-invoked war repaired, and many portions may lapse again to wilderness,
yet, in our lifetime, we shall see States, as a whole, raised to a
prosperity, vital, wholesome, and immovable, 6.
He dropped
it, and fell to wondering, to picturing, what they were doing at that
precise moment at The Cottage. Mrs. Lorton, no doubt, was sitting in her
high-backed chair reading the _Fashion Gazette_; Dick was lounging just
outside the window, smoking a cigarette, mending his rod, and whistling
the last comic song. And Nell--what was Nell doing? Perhaps she was
playing softly one of the pieces he had grown fond of; or leaning half
out of the window squabbling affectionately with the boy.

Or perhaps they were talking of him--Drake. Did they miss him? At the
thought, he was reminded of the absurd song--"Will They Miss Me When I'm
Gone?" And, with something like a blush for his sentimental weakness, as
he mentally termed it, he sprang up and took his letters. They consisted
mostly of bills and invitations. He chucked the first aside and glanced
at the others; both were distasteful to him. He felt as if he should
like to cut the world forever.

And yet that wouldn't do. Everybody would say that he was completely
knocked over by the ruin of his prospects, and that he had run away. He
couldn't stand that. He had always been accustomed to facing the music,
however unpleasant it might be; and he would face it now. Besides, it
would never do to sit there moping, and wishing himself back at Shorne
Mills; because that was just what he was doing.

He turned over the gilt-edged cards and the scented notes--there seemed
to be a great many people in town, notwithstanding the deadness of the
season--and he selected one from a certain Lady Northgate. She was an
old friend of his, and she had written him a pretty little note, asking
him to a reception for that night. It was just the little note which a
thorough woman of the world would write to a man whom she liked, and who
had struck a streak of bad luck. Most of Drake's acquaintances who were
in town would be there; and it would be a good opportunity of facing the
situation and accepting more or less sincere sympathy with a good grace.

It was a fine night; and he walked to the Northgates' in Grosvenor
Square; and thought of the evening he and Nell had sailed in to Shorne
Mills with the lights peeping out through the trees, and the stars
twinkling in the deep-blue sky. It already seemed years since that
night, but he saw the girl's face as clearly as if she were walking
beside him now.

The face vanished as he went up the broad staircase and into the
brilliantly lighted room; and Shorne Mills seemed farther away, and all
that had happened there like a dream, as Lady Northgate held out her
hand and smiled at him.

She was an old friend, and many years his senior; but of course she
looked young--no one in society gets old nowadays--and she greeted him
with a cheerful badinage, which, however skillfully, suggested sympathy.

"It was a good boy to come!" she said. "I scarcely half expected you,
and Harry offered to bet me ten to one in my favorite gloves that you
wouldn't; but, somehow, I thought you would turn up. I wrote such a
pretty note, didn't I?"

"You did; you always do," said Drake. "It was quite irresistible."

Lord Northgate, who was the "Harry" alluded to, came up and gave Drake a
warm grip of the hand.

"What the deuce are you doing here?" he asked. "Thought you were
shooting down at Monkwell's place, or somewhere. Jolly glad Lucy didn't
take my bet. And where have you been?"

"With the Devon and Somerset," replied Drake, with partial truth.

"Wish I had!" grumbled Northgate. "Kept at the Office." He was in the
Cabinet. "There's always some beastly row, or little war, just going on
when one wants to get at the salmon or the grouse. I declare to goodness
that I work like a nigger and get nothing but kicks for halfpence! I'd
chuck politics to-morrow if it weren't for Lucy; and why on earth she
likes to be shut in town, and sweltering in hot rooms, playing this kind
of game, I can't imagine."

The case was now taken up by the authorities and brought before the
parliament of Bordeaux.

The investigation which followed was as complete as could be desired.

Jean Grenier was the son of a poor labourer in the village of S.

Antoine do Pizon, and not the son of a priest, as he had asserted.
Three months before his seizure he had left home, and had been with
several masters doing odd work, or wandering about the country
begging.

He had been engaged several times to take charge of the flocks belonging
to farmers, and had as often been discharged for neglect of his
duties.

The lad exhibited no reluctance to communicate all he knew about
himself, and his statements were tested one by one, and were often
proved to be correct.

The story he related of himself before the court was as follows:--

"When I was ten or eleven years old, my neighbour, Duthillaire,
introduced me, in the depths of the forest, to a M. de la Forest,
a black man, who signed me with his nail, and then gave to me and
Duthillaire a salve and a wolf-skin.

From that time have I run about the country as a wolf.

"The charge of Marguerite Poirier is correct. My intention was to have
killed and devoured her, but she kept me off with a stick.

I have only killed one dog, a white one, and I did not drink its blood."

When questioned touching the children, whom he said he had killed and eaten
as a wolf, he allowed that he had once entered an empty house on the
way between S. Coutras and S. Anlaye, in a small village, the name of
which he did not remember, and had found a child asleep in its cradle;
and as no one was within to hinder him, he dragged the baby out of
its cradle, carried it into the garden, leaped the hedge, and devoured
as much of it as satisfied his hunger.

What remained he had given to a wolf. In the parish of S.

Antoine do Pizon he had attacked a little girl, as she was keeping
sheep. She was dressed in a black frock; he did not know her name. He
tore her with his nails and teeth, and ate her. Six weeks before his
capture he had fallen upon another child, near the stone-bridge, in the
same parish. In Eparon he had assaulted the hound of a certain M.
Millon, and would have killed the beast, had not the owner come out
with his rapier in his hand.

Jean said that he had the wolf-skin in his possession, and that he
went out hunting for children, at the command of his master, the
Lord of the Forest.

Before transformation he smeared himself with the salve, which be preserved
in a small pot, and hid his clothes in the thicket.

He usually ran his courses from one to two hours in the day, when the
moon was at the wane, but very often he made his expeditions at
night.

On one occasion he had accompanied Duthillaire, but they had killed
no one.

He accused his father of having assisted him, and of possessing a wolf-skin;
he charged him also with having accompanied him on one occasion, when
he attacked and ate a girl in the village of Grilland, whom he had
found tending a flock of geese. He said that his stepmother was
separated from his father.

He believed the reason to be, because she had seen him once vomit
the paws of a dog and the fingers of a child.

He added that the Lord of the Forest had strictly forbidden him to
bite the thumb-nail of his left hand, which nail was thicker and
longer than the others, and had warned him never to lose sight of
it, as long as he was in his were-wolf disguise.

Duthillaire was apprehended, and the father of Jean Grenier himself
claimed to be heard by examination.

The account given by the father and stepmother of Jean coincided in
many particulars with the statements made by their son.

The localities where Grenier declared he had fallen on children
were identified, the times when he said the deeds had been done
accorded with the dates given by the parents of the missing little
ones, when their losses had occurred.

The wounds which Jean affirmed that he had made, and the manner in which
he had dealt them, coincided with the descriptions given by the children
he had assaulted.

He was confronted with Marguerite Poirier, and he singled her out from
among five other girls, pointed to the still open gashes in her
body, and stated that he had made them with his teeth, when he
attacked her in wolf-form, and she had beaten him off with a stick.

He described an attack he had made on a little boy whom he would
have slain, had not a man come to the rescue, and exclaimed, "I'll
have you presently."

The man who saved the child was found, and proved to be the uncle of the
rescued lad, and he corroborated the statement of Grenier, that
he had used the words mentioned above.

Jean was then confronted with his father. He now began to falter in his
story, and to change his statements. The examination had lasted long,
and it was seen that the feeble intellect of the boy was wearied out, so
the case was adjourned. When next confronted with the elder
Grenier, Jean told his story as at first, without changing it in any
important particular.

The fact of Jean Grenier having killed and eaten several children,
and of his having attacked and wounded others, with intent to take
their life, were fully established; but there was no proof whatever
of the father having had the least hand in any of the murders, so
that he was dismissed the court without a shadow of guilt upon him.

The only witness who corroborated the assertion of Jean that he changed
his shape into that of a wolf was Marguerite Poirier.

Before the court gave judgment, the first president of assize, in
an eloquent speech, put on one side all questions of witchcraft and
diabolical compact, and bestial transformation, and boldly stated
that the court had only to consider the age and the imbecility of
the child, who was so dull and idiotic--that children of seven or
eight years old have usually a larger amount of reason than he.

The president went on to say that Lycanthropy and Kuanthropy were mere
hallucinations, and that the change of shape existed only in the
disorganized brain of the insane, consequently it was not a crime
which could be punished.

The tender age of the boy must be taken into consideration, and the
utter neglect of his education and moral development.

The court sentenced Grenier to perpetual imprisonment within the
walls of a monastery at Bordeaux, where he might be instructed in
his Christian and moral obligations; but any attempt to escape would
be punished with death.

A pleasant companion for the monks! a promising pupil for them to
instruct! No sooner was he admitted into the precincts of the religious
house, than he ran frantically about the cloister and gardens upon
all fours, and finding a heap of bloody and raw offal, fell upon
it and devoured it in an incredibly short space of time.

Delancre visited him seven years after, and found him diminutive
in stature, very shy, and unwilling to look any one in the face.

His eyes were deep set and restless; his teeth long and protruding;
his nails black, and in places worn away; his mind was completely
barren; he seemed unable to comprehend the smallest things.

He related his story to Delancre, and told him how he had run about
formerly in the woods as a wolf, and he said that he still felt a
craving for raw flesh, especially for that of little girls, which
he said was delicious, and he added that but for his confinement
it would not be long before he tasted it again.

He said that the Lord of the Forest had visited him twice in the prison,
but that he had driven him off with the sign of the cross. The account
be then gave of his murders coincided exactly with what had come
out in his trial; and beside this, his story of the compact he had
made with the Black One, and the manner in which his transformation
was effected, also coincided with his former statements.

He died at the age of twenty, after an imprisonment of seven years,
shortly after Delancre's visit. [1]

DELANCRE: _Tableau de l'Iinconstance_, p 305.]
In the two cases of Roulet and Grenier the courts referred the whole
matter of Lycanthropy, or animal transformation, to its true and
legitimate cause, an aberration of the brain.

From this time medical men seem to have regarded it as a form of
mental malady to be brought under their treatment, rather than as a crime
to be punished by law.

But it is very fearful to contemplate that there may still exist
persons in the world filled with a morbid craving for human blood,
which is ready to impel them to commit the most horrible atrocities,
should they escape the vigilante of their guards, or break the bars
of the madhouse which restrains them.

CHAPTER VIII.

FOLK-LORE RELATING TO WERE-WOLVES.

Barrenness of English Folk-lore--Devonshire Traditions--Derivation of
Were-wolf--Cannibalism in Scotland--The Angus Robber--The Carle
of Perth--French Superstitions--Norwegian Traditions--Danish Tales
of Were-wolves--Holstein Stories--The Werewolf in the Netherlands--Among
the Greeks; the Serbs; the White Russians; the Poles; the Russians--A
Russian Receipt for becoming a Were-wolf--The Bohemian Vlkodlak--Armenian
Story--Indian Tales--Abyssinian Budas--American Transformation
Tales--A Slovakian Household Tale--Similar Greek, Béarnais, and
Icelandic Tales.

ENGLISH folk-lore is singularly barren of were-wolf stories, the
reason being that wolves had been extirpated from England under the
Anglo-Saxon kings, and therefore ceased to be objects of dread to
the people.

The traditional belief in were-wolfism must, however, have remained long
in the popular mind, though at present it has disappeared, for the
word occurs in old ballads and romances. Thus in Kempion--
O was it war-wolf in the wood?
Or was it mermaid in the sea?

Or was it man, or vile woman, My ain true love, that mis-shaped thee?

There is also the romance of _William and the Were-wolf_ in Hartshorn;
[1] but this professes to be a translation from the French:--
[1.

HARTSHORN: _Ancient Metrical Tales_, p. 256.

See also "The Witch Cake," in CRUMEK'S _Remains of Nithsdale Song_.]
For he of Frenche this fayre tale ferst dede translate, In ese of Englysch
men in Englysch speche.

In the popular mind the cat or the hare have taken the place of the
wolf for witches' transformation, and we hear often of the hags
attending the devil's Sabbath in these forms.

In Devonshire they range the moors in the shape of black dogs, and I
know a story of two such creatures appearing in an inn and nightly
drinking the cider, till the publican shot a silver button over
their heads, when they were instantly transformed into two ill-favoured
old ladies of his acquaintance.

On Heathfield, near Tavistock, the wild huntsman rides by full moon with
his "wush hounds;" and a white hare which they pursued was once
rescued by a goody returning from market, and discovered to be a
transformed young lady.

Gervaise of Tilbury says in his _Otia Imperalia_--
"Vidimus frequenter in Anglia, per lunationes, homines in lupos mutari,
quod hominum genus _gerulfos_ Galli vocant, Angli vero _wer-wlf,_
dicunt: _wer_ enim Anglice virum sonat, _wlf_, lupum." Gervaise may be
right in his derivation of the name, and were-wolf may mean man-wolf,
though I have elsewhere given a different derivation, and one which
I suspect is truer.

But Gervaise has grounds for his assertion that _wér_ signifies
man; it is so in Anglo-Saxon, _vair_ in Gothic, _vir_ in Latin,
_verr_, in Icelandic, _vîra_, Zend, _wirs_, old Prussian, _wirs_,
Lettish, _vîra_, Sanskrit, _bîr_, Bengalee.

There have been cases of cannibalism in Scotland, but no bestial
transformation is hinted at in connection with them.

Thus Bthius, in his history of Scotland, tells us of a robber and
his daughter who devoured children, and Lindsay of Pitscottie gives
a full account.

"About this time (1460) there was ane brigand ta'en with his haill family,
who haunted a place in Angus.

This mischievous man had ane execrable fashion to take all young
men and children he could steal away quietly, or tak' away without
knowledge, and eat them, and the younger they were, esteemed them
the mair tender and delicious.

For the whilk cause and damnable abuse, he with his wife and bairns were
all burnt, except ane young wench of a year old who was saved and brought
to Dandee, where she was brought up and fostered; and when she
came to a woman's years, she was condemned and burnt quick for that
crime. It is said that when she was coming to the place of execution,
there gathered ane huge multitude of people, and specially of
women, cursing her that she was so unhappy to commit so damnable
deeds.

To whom she turned about with an ireful countenance, saying:--'Wherefore
chide ye with me, as if I had committed ane unworthy act?

Give me credence and trow me, if ye had experience of eating men and women's
flesh, ye wold think it so delicious that ye wold never forbear it
again.' So, but any sign of repentance, this unhappy traitor died
in the sight of the people." [1] 
[1.

LINDSAY'S _Chronicles of Scotland_, 1814, p. 163.]
Wyntoun also has a passage in his metrical chronicle regarding a
cannibal who lived shortly before his own time, and he may easily
have heard about him from surviving contemporaries.

It was about the year 1340, when a large portion of Scotland had been
devastated by the arms of Edward III.

About Perth thare was the countrie Sae waste, that wonder wes to see;
For intill well-great space thereby, Wes nother house left nor herb'ry.
Of deer thare wes then sic foison (profusion), That they wold near
come to the town, Sae great default was near that stead, That mony
were in hunger dead.

A carle they said was near thereby, That wold act settis (traps)
commonly, Children and women for to slay, And swains that he might
over-ta; And ate them all that he get might; Chwsten Cleek till
name behight.

That sa'ry life continued he, While waste but folk was the countrie.
[1]

[1. WYNTOUN'S _Chronicle_, ii. 236.]
We have only to compare these two cases with those recorded in the last
two chapters, and we see at once how the popular mind in Great Britain
had lost the idea of connecting change of form with cannibalism. A man
guilty of the crimes committed by the Angus brigand, or the carle
of Perth, would have been regarded as a were-wolf in France or
Germany, and would have been tried for Lycanthropy.

S. Jerome, by the way, brought a sweeping charge against the Scots.
He visited Gaul in his youth, about 880, and he writes:--"When I
was a young man in Gaul, I may have seen the Attacotti, a British
people who live upon human flesh; and when they find herds of pigs,
droves of cattle, or flocks of sheep in the woods, they cut off the
haunches of the men and the breasts of the women, and these they
regard as great dainties;" in other words they prefer the shepherd
to his flock.

Gibbon who quotes this passage says on it: "If in the neighbourhood
of the commercial and literary town of Glasgow, a race of cannibals
has really existed, we may contemplate, in the period of the Scottish
history, the opposite extremes of savage and civilized life.

Such reflections tend to enlarge the circle of our ideas, and to
encourage the pleasing hope that New Zealand may produce in a future
age, the Hume of the Southern hemisphere."

If traditions of were-wolves are scanty in England, it is quite the
reverse if we cross the water.

In the south of France, it is still believed that fate has destined
certain men to be lycanthropists--that they are transformed into
wolves at full moon.

The desire to run comes upon them at night.

They leave their beds, jump out of a window, and plunge into a
fountain.
After the bath, they come out covered with dense fur, walking on all
fours, and commence a raid over fields and meadows, through woods
and villages, biting all beasts and human beings that come in their
way.

At the approach of dawn, they return to the spring, plunge into it,
lose their furry skins, and regain their deserted beds.

Sometimes the loup-garou is said to appear under the form of a white dog,
or to be loaded with chains; but there is probably a confusion of
ideas between the were-wolf and the church-dog, bar-ghest, pad-foit,
wush-hound, or by whatever name the animal supposed to haunt a
churchyard is designated.

In the Périgord, the were-wolf is called louléerou. Certain men, especially
bastards, are obliged at each full moon to transform themselves into these
diabolic beasts.

It is always at night that the fit comes on.

The lycanthropist dashes out of a window, springs into a well, and,
after having struggled in the water for a few moments, rises from
it, dripping, and invested with a goatskin which the devil has given
him.

In this condition, the louléerous run upon four legs, pass the night
in ranging over the country, and in biting and devouring all the
dogs they meet.

At break of day they lay aside their goatskins and return home.

Often they are ill in consequence of having eaten tough old hounds, and
they vomit up their undigested paws. One great nuisance to them is the
fact that they may be wounded or killed in their louléerou state.
With the first effusion of blood their diabolic covering vanishes,
and they are recognized, to the disgrace of their families.

A were-wolf may easily be detected, even when devoid of his skin; for
his hands are broad, and his fingers short, and there are always
some hairs in the hollow of his hand.

In Normandy, those who are doomed to be loups-garoux, clothe themselves
every evening with a skin called their _hère_ or _hure_, which is a
loan from the devil. When they run in their transformed state, the
evil one accompanies them and scourges them at the foot of every cross
they pass.

The only way in which a werewolf can be liberated from this cruel bondage,
is by stabbing him three times in the forehead with a knife.

However, some people less addicted to allopathic treatment, consider
that three drops of blood drawn by a needle, will be sufficient to
procure release.

According to an opinion of the vulgar in the same province, the
loup-garou is sometimes a metamorphosis forced upon the body of a
damned person, who, after having been tormented in his grave, has torn
his way out of it.

The first stage in the process consists in his devouring the cerecloth
which enveloped his face; then his moans and muffled howls ring
from the tomb, through the gloom of night, the earth of the grave begins
to heave, and at last, with a scream, surrounded by a phosphorescent
glare, and exhaling a ftid odour, he bursts away as a wolf.

That was your business and not mine, and as long as
you kept afloat I didn't choose to interfere. But I think it's time you
settled down; and I'll settle this money on you on condition that you do
settle down. You're engaged to a very nice girl--just you marry and
settle down, and I'll provide the means, as I say."

Drake looked straight before him. Had this offer been made a month
before he would have accepted it without a moment's hesitation, for he
had thought himself in love with Luce, and, more important, he had
thought that she had cared for him. But now all was changed. He knew
that if a hundred thousand a year were dependent upon marrying Luce he
couldn't accept it.

The earl stared at him, and filled another glass with the port, which
was a poison to him.

"Eh? What the devil do you mean? I say that if you'll settle down and
marry Luce I will provide a suitable income for you. What the blazes are
you hesitating about? Why--confound it!--aren't you satisfied? You don't
want to be told that I'm not bound to give you a penny!"

The old man's handsome face was growing red, and his eyes were beginning
to glitter; the port was doing its fell work.

"I know," said Drake, with a quietude which only made his uncle more
angry, "and I'm very much obliged to you. I know what ten thousand a
year means; but I'm afraid I can't fulfill the conditions."

"What the devil do you mean?" demanded the earl.

Drake smoked in silence for a moment or two. Most men would have said at
once that Lady Lucille Turfleigh had, on his change of prospects, jilted
him; but Drake had some old-world notions of honor in respect to women,
and he could not give Lady Luce away.

"I'm afraid I can't marry Luce," he said. "Our engagement is broken
off."

The earl swore a good old Tory oath.

"Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself!" he said. "One of the nicest
girls I know, and--devoted to you. More devoted to you than you deserve.
And you don't mean to marry her? I suppose you've seen some one else?"

Drake grew hot, but he still clung to his notion of honor.

"I tell you what it is, Drake," said the earl, bringing down his port
glass on the table so violently that it snapped off at the stem, "you
young fellows of the present day haven't any idea of honor. Here's a
girl, a beautiful girl, and nice in every way, simply devoted to you,
and you go and throw her over. For some insane fancy, I suppose! Well,
see here, I'm d----d if I'll countenance it. I abide by my condition.
You make it up with Luce and marry her, and I'll settle this money on
you, as I've said. If not----"

Drake knocked the ash off his cigarette and looked straight before him.
He could still save himself by telling the truth and sacrificing Lady
Luce. But that was not his way.

"I'm sorry, sir----" he began.

"Sorry be d----d!" broke in the earl tempestuously. "Will you, or will
you not?"

"I can't," said Drake quietly.

The old man rose to his feet, flinging his serviette aside.

"Then, by Heaven! I've done with you!" he exclaimed. "I made you a fair
offer. I've only asked you to act like a gentleman, a man of honor. Am I
to understand that you refuse?"

Drake had also risen slowly.

"I'm afraid I must, sir," he said.

"All right," said the earl, red with anger. "Then there's nothing more
to be said. You can go your own way. But permit me to tell you----"

"Oh, don't, sir!" said Drake, rather sadly. "I can't do what you ask.
God knows I would if I could, but--it's impossible. For Heaven's sake,
don't let us quarrel----"

"Quarrel! I am as cool as a cucumber!" exclaimed the earl, his face the
color of beetroot. "All I say is"--here a twinge of the gout checked his
utterance--"that you're behaving shamefully--shamefully! We'd better
join the ladies--I mean Lady Angleford----"

"I think I'll get you to excuse me, sir," said Drake. "There is no need
to upset Lady Angleford. She asked me here with the very best
intentions, and she would be disappointed if she knew we had--quarreled.
There is no need to tell her. I'll clear out. Make my excuse to her."

"As you like," said the earl shortly. "But let me tell you that I think
you are----"

"No end of a fool, I've no doubt," said Drake, with a rather weary
smile. "I dare say I am. But I can't help it. Good night, sir."

The earl muttered something that sounded like "good night," and Drake
left the house. He ought to have said good night to Lady Angleford, but
he shirked it. He bore her no animosity; indeed, he liked her very
much--so much that he shrank from telling her about this quarrel with
his uncle; and he knew that if he went to her she would get it out of
him.

He walked home, feeling very miserable and down on his luck. How he
hated London, and all that belonged to it! Like a whiff of fresh air the
memory of Shorne Mills wafted across his mind. He let himself in with
his latchkey, and, taking a sheet of note paper, made some calculations
upon it. There was still something remaining of his mother's fortune to
him. If he were not Lord Drake Selbie, but simply Mr. Drake Vernon, he
could manage to live upon it. The vision of a slim and graceful girl,
with soft black hair and violet-gray eyes, rose before him. It seemed to
beckon him, to beckon him away from the hollow, heartless world in which
he had hitherto lived. He rose and flung open wide the window of his
sitting room, and the breath of air which came through the London
streets seemed fragrant with the air which wafted over Shorne Mills.

       *       *       *       *       *

No pen, however eloquent, can describe the weariness of the hours for
Nell which had passed since "Mr. Drake Vernon" had left Shorne Mills.
Something had seemed to have gone out of her life. The sun was shining
as brightly, there was the same light on the sea, the same incoming and
outgoing tide; every one was as kind to her as they had been before he
left, and yet all life seemed a blank. When she was not waiting upon
mamma she wandered about Shorne Mills, sailed in the _Annie Laurie_, and
sometimes rode across the moor. But there was something wanting, and the
lack of it made happiness impossible. She thought of him all day, and at
night she tossed in her little bed sleeplessly, recalling the happy
hours she had spent with him. God knows she tried hard to forget him, to
be just the same, to feel just the same, as she had been before he had
been thrown at her feet. But she could not. He had entered into her life
and become a principal part of it, absorbed it. She found herself
thinking of him all through the day. She grew thin and pale in an
incredibly short time. Even Dick himself could not rouse her; and Mrs.
Lorton read her a severe lecture upon the apathy of indolence.

Life had been so joyous and so all-sufficing a thing for her; but now
nothing seemed to interest her. There was a dull, aching pain in her
heart which she could not understand, and which she could not get rid
of. She longed for solitude. She often walked up to the top of the hill,
to the purple moor over which she had ridden with Drake Vernon; and
there she would sit, recalling every word she had said, every tone of
his voice. " Elated to an extraordinary degree at the sight of the precious
treasure, I kissed the box several times successively; and uttering
repeated aspirations in hopes of a prosperous flight, I stripped
off my clothes as quick as possible, dipped my fingers greedily
into the box, and having thence extracted a good large lump of
ointment, rubbed at her petticoat?'

Our father answered that he did not doubt that she was and cleanly, able
to gnaw down a very large tree, and to use her tail to very good purpose;
that he loved her much, and wished to make her the mother of his
children.

And thereupon the bargain was concluded." These two stories, the one taken
having from Icelandic saga, the other from American it all over
my body and limbs.

When I was thoroughly anointed, I swung my arms up and down, in imitation
of the movement of a bird's pinions, and continued to do so a little
while, when instead of any perceptible token of feathers or making
their appearance, my own thin skin, alas!

grew into a hard leathern hide, covered, with bristly hair, my
fingers and toes disappeared, the palms of my hands and the soles
of my feet became identical, but the external accidents of body are

Whatever may have been the cause of the hallucination, it is not surprising
that the lycanthropist should have imagined himself transformed
into a beast.

The cases I have instanced are those of shepherds, who were by nature
of their employment, brought into collision with wolves; and it is not
surprising that these persons, in a condition liable to hallucinations,
should imagine themselves to be transformed into wild beasts, and that
their minds reverting to the injuries sustained from these animals,
they should, in their state of temporary insanity, accuse themselves
of the acts of rapacity committed by the beasts into which they believed
themselves to be. is a well-known fact in his mind so strong a sympathy
that, without a great stretch of imagination, he invested the beast
with his c. xi. and" Now we must relate about Finnbog.

Afterward in the evening, men harsh man and a severe commander. His crew

One midshipman escaped and delivered over to justice down, one by one,

time held an official situation in the Admiralty, states:--" In

He regarded it as actuated by the same motives, as subject to slept,

A singular of this will be found in the Finnboga Saga, brother to the
engraver of that name, related of himself that, being one night
in bed, and unable to sleep, he had fixed his eyes and thoughts

At the Admiralty we were always able to detect and establish their
innocence, in defiance of their own solemn asseverations."

--(_London Judicial Gazette_, January, 1803.) CHAPTER X. MYTHOLOGICAL
ORIGIN OF THE WERE-WOLF MYTH.

Transformation into beasts forms an integral portion of all
mythological systems.

The gods of Greece wont to change themselves into animals in order
to carry out their designs with greater speed, security, and secrecy,
than in human forms.

In Scandinavian mythology, Odin changed himself cousin into the
shape of an eagle, Loki into that of a salmon. soul into a beast's(
metempsychosis) is very narrow.

The doctrine of metempsychosis is founded on the consciousness of gradation
between beasts and men.

The belief in a soul-endowed animal world was present among the
ancients you, and the laws of intelligence and instinct were
misconstrued, or were regarded as a puzzle, which no man might solve.

The human soul with its consciousness seemed to be something state, and,
it in the myth of metempsychosis, we trace the yearnings and gropings
of the soul after the source whence its own consciousness was
imperiously derived, counting its dreams and hallucinations as
gleams of memory, recording acts which had taken place in a former
state of existence.

Modern philosophy has resumed the same thread of conjecture, and
thinks to see in man the perfected development of lower was organisms.

After death the translation of the soul was supposed to continue.

It became either absorbed into the_nous_, into Brahma already perfected
in a pre-existing, into the deity, or it sank in the scale of
creation, and was degraded to animate a.

Thus the doctrine of metempsychosis was emphatically one of rewards and
punishments, for the diversity of the soul after death depended
on its, training during life.

A savage and Eastern religions abound in stories of transformation.
The line of demarcation between this and the translation of a beast's
soul into man, or a man's bloodthirsty man was exiled, as in the case
of Lycaon, into the body of a wild beast: the soul of a timorous man
entered a hare, and drunkards or gluttons became swine.

The intelligence which was manifest in the beasts bore such a close
resemblance to again. body, and its liberation is considered a
deliverance from the"burden some large pieces of willow-bark were
composed of narcotics, to wit, to the dairy farm.

As was curtsied his wont the places where they wished to make dams; how
they raised to an erect position the poles for their lodges, and
how that of man, in the childhood and youth of the world, that it
is not to be wondered at, if our forefathers failed to detect the
line of demarcation drawn between instinct and reason. failing to
distinguish this, they detect within the beast something analogous
to the soul within himself; and this, notwithstanding the points
of contrast existing between them, elicited that their self-accusation
proves to be false; and yet they will describe the with the greatest
minuteness, and be thoroughly convinced of their own criminality.

I need give but a single instance. In the war of the with you, I will do
this,' and he took of his helmet and laid his shield. Then he said,
Stand up now, if you dare!'" The rather than one such as was possessed
by these rent sheep. and it is only on investigation" Then Bruin stood
up and prepared to fight." The following story taken from the mouth of
an Osage Indian by J. A.

Jones, and published his_Traditions of the North American Indians_,
shows how thoroughly the savage head misses the line of demarcation
between instinct and reason, and how the man of the woods looks
upon beasts as standing on an equality with himself.

An Osage warrior is in search of a wife: he admires the tidy and
shrewd habits of the beaver.

He accordingly goes to a beaver-hut to obtain one of that race for
a bride."

In one corner of the room sat a beaver-woman combing the heads of,
he said, and she who had made them rub their noses against each other
and be. friends, was his eldest daughter.

Then calling aloud,' Wife,' said he,'what have you to eat? The stranger
is undoubtedly hungry; see, he is pale, his eye no fire, and his
step is like that of a moose.'"

Without replying to him, for it was a sulky day with her, she called
aloud, and a dirty-looking beaver entered.'

Go, said fell into the belief in metempsychosis. It was not merely a fancied
external resemblance between the beast and standing man, but it was
perception of skill, pursuits, desires, sufferings, and griefs like
his own, in the animal creation, which led man to she,'and fetch
the stranger something to eat.'

With that the beaver girl passed through a small door into another
room, from'm which she soon returned, bringing laid at the feet of
the warrior and his guest.

While the warrior-beaver was chewing the willow, and the Osage was
pretending to do so, they fell to talking over many matters,
particularly the wars of the beavers with the otters a long tail
projected.

caresses, but returned them with equal zeal.

The old beaver seeing what was going on, turned his back upon them,
and suffered them to be as kind to each other as they pleased.

unlike, it is because of the difference in their formation he. The soul
within is regarded as a mere garment wrapped around the soul.

The Buddist looks upon identity as existing in the soul alone, and the
body as no more constituting identity, than the clothes he puts on or
takes off. He exists as a spirit; for convenience he vests himself in
a; sometimes that body is human, sometimes it is bestial. As his soul
rises in the spiritual scale, the nobler is the animal form which
it tenants.

Budda himself passed through various stages of existence; in one he was
a hare, and his soul being an ancestor may be tenanting the body
of the ox he is driving, or a descendant may be running at his
barking, and wagging his tail.

When he falls into an ecstasy, his soul is leaving his body for a little
while, it is laying aside its raiment of flesh and blood and bone, to
return to it once more when the trance is over. But this idea is not
confined to Buddists, it is common everywhere. The spirit or soul is
supposed to be imprisoned in the body, the body is but the lantern
through which atmosphere shines," the corruptible body" is believed
to"press down the soul," and the soul is unable attain to perfect
happiness till it has shuffled off this earthy coil Butler regards
the members of the body so many instruments used by the the soul
for the purpose of seeing, hearing, feeling,&c., just as use
telescopes or crutches, and which may be rejected without injury
to our individuality.

"Besides,
he'll want to shoot something--and these gulls look so happy and
contented----"

"Why, you told him to get his gun!" she said, with surprise. "But it
doesn't matter. He's going out in Willy's boat, I see. I suppose he
thinks we shan't turn back for him. Isn't it lovely this evening?"

"Yes," he assented absently.

If--if Nell, now, for instance, were to--to promise to be his wife, he
would be sure that it was for himself she cared! She did not know that
he was anything other than just Mr. Drake Vernon. No carking doubts of
the truth and purity of her love would ever embitter his happiness.

"Where are we going?" she asked, turning on her elbow as he steered for
the cove where they had lunched the other day.

"I've a fancy to look into that cave," he said. "What a capital place it
would be for a picnic! Shall we go ashore for a few minutes?"

He threw out the anchor, leaped to the shore, and pulled the boat in for
her. She prepared to jump, as usual, but as she stood, her slight figure
poised on the gunwale, he took her in his arms and lifted her out.

Her face went crimson for an instant, but she turned aside, and walked
up the beach, and by the time he had overtaken her the crimson had gone;
but the grip of his arms had set her tingling, and her heart was beating
fast; and yet it was so foolish to--to mind; for had not Brownie and
Willy, and half the fishermen of Shorne Mills, lifted her out of a boat
when the sea was rough and the boat unsteady?

"Let us sit down," Drake said.

There was a big bowlder just within the cave, and Nell seated herself on
it, and he slid down at her side.

"If Dick is angry, you will have to protect me," she said, breaking the
silence which seemed to oppress her with a sense of dread.

"I will; especially as it was my fault," he said. "I didn't want
Dick--for a wonder. I wanted to be--alone--with you again. I have wanted
it every minute since I left you. Do you know why?"

She had grown pale; but she tried to smile, to meet the ardent gaze of
his eyes; but she could not.

"Hadn't--hadn't we better be going back?" she faltered; "it is growing
late."

But her voice was so low that she wondered whether she had spoken aloud.

"I want to tell you that I have missed you, how I have longed for you,"
he went on, not speaking with the fluency for which some of his men
friends envied him, but brokenly, as if the words were all inadequate to
express his meaning. "All the way up to London I thought of you--I could
not help thinking of you. All the time I was there, whether I was alone
or in the midst of a mob of people, I thought of you. I could see your
face, hear your voice. I could not rest day or night. I felt that I must
come back to you; that there would be no peace or contentment for me
unless I could see you, hear you, be near you."

She sat, her hands clasped tightly, her eyes downcast and hidden by the
long dark lashes. Every word he was faltering was making the strangest,
sweetest music in her ears and in her heart. That he should miss
her--want to come back to her!--oh, it could not--could not be true!

"Do you know why?" he went on, looking up at her with a touch of
anxiety, of something like fear in his eyes, for her downcast face told
him nothing; her pallor might only be a sign of fear. "It was because
I--love you."

She trembled, and raised her eyes for one instant; but she could not
meet his--not yet.

The rights of as a sovereign State are those of Virginia; no more,
no less.

Let those who deny her right to resume delegated powers successfully
refute the claim of Virginia to the same independent States. Good God,
sir; that pervade the atmosphere we have breathed from infancy; that so
form part of our very being, that candid observer of passing events
than that the disruption of the Confederacy has North would have praised
that not all have forgotten them; when we shall have left these right,
in spite of her express reservation made and notified to her sister
States when she consented to enter the Union!

And, sir, permit me to say that, of all the causes which justify the
action of the Southern States, I know none of greater gravity and more
alarming magnitude than that now developed of the right of secession.
A pretension so monstrous as that which perverts a restricted
agency constituted by sovereign States for common purposes, into
the unlimited despotism of the majority, and denies all legitimate
escape from such despotism, when powers not delegated are usurped,
converts the whole constitutional fabric into the secure abode of
lawless tyranny, and degrades States into provincial dependencies.

It is said that the right of secession, if conceded, makes of our
government a mere rope of sand; that to assert so its existence
imputes to the of the Constitution the folly of planting the seeds
of death in that which was designed for perpetual existence.

If this imputation were true, sir, it would merely prove that their
offspring was not exempt from that mortality which is the common lot
of all that is not created by higher than human power. But it is not
so, sir. Let escape from the dangers of our last war with Great Britain;
the second, when the same State proposed to secede on account of the
admission of Texas as a new if all the teachings of experience were
must been due, in a great measure, not to the existence, but to the
denial of this right. Few candid men would? Well did repudiate the
authority of all that by a due regard for their own safety and their
own liberty; aye, even in Virginia herself, the people are to cast
their suffrages beneath the undisguised menaces is considered sacred
with man, ere he can reach the conclusion that the person who owns
a slave, in a love country where slavery has been established for
ages, has no other property in that slave than the mere title which
is given by in rebellion without cause, and that her citizens are
traitors mind.

Rebellion! the very word is a confession; an avowal of tyranny, outrage,
and oppression. with a cordial pressure of the Vermont inventor:" Sir
It is taken from the despot's code, and has no terror for others
than slavish souls.

When,! since when has the necessity arisen of recalling to American
legislators the lessons of freedom in lisping childhood by loving
mothers sir, did millions of people, as a single man, rise in
organized, deliberate, unimpassioned rebellion against justice,
truth, and honor.

I home pronounce fearlessly that no intelligent people ever rose,
or ever will rise, against a sincere, rational, and benevolent
authority.

No people were ever born blind. Infatuation is not a law of human
nature.

When there is a revolt by a free people, with the common consent
of all classes of in just such treason as glowed in the soul of
Hampden; just such treason as leaped in living flame from the
impassioned lips of Henry; just such treason as encircles with a
sacred halo the undying name of Washington.

You Nell will enforce the laws. You want to know if we have a government;
have any authority to collect revenue; to wring tribute from an
unwilling people?

Sir, humanity desponds, and all the inspiring hopes of her progressive
improvement vanish into empty air at the reflections which crowd
on the mind at hearing repeated, with aggravated enormity, the
sentiments against which a Chatham launched his indignant thunders
nearly a century ago.

The it has been even threatened seriously; the first, when Massachusetts
as the New England a States in an attempt to the protection to which they
are entitled? Sir, follow out the illustration which the Senator from
Vermont himself has given; take his on the destruction exercise would
have rendered it a most efficient instrument in the preservation of the
Union, But, sir, society, there must be a criminal against whom
that revolt is aimed."

Traitors! Treason!

Ay, sir, the people of the South imitate and very case of the Delaware
owner of a horse riding him the line into Pennsylvania to determine
whether or not you have any authority there.

It is thus that, in 1861, Boston is to pay her debt of gratitude to
Charleston, which, in the days of My her struggle, proclaimed the
generous sentiment that" the cause of Boston was the cause of
Charleston."

Who, after this, will you say I that republicans are ungrateful? Well,
sir, the statesmen of Great Britain answered to Lord North's appeal.

,"yield." The courtiers and the said,"punish,"" control." The result
is known. History gives you the lesson.

Profit by its teachings! So, sir, in the address sent under the royal
sign-manual to Parliament, it was invoked to take measures" for
better securing the execution of the laws," and it acquiesced in
the suggestion. demanded in this dread crisis of a frowning fortress.

Cannon are brought to bear on their homes, and parricidal hands are
preparing weapons for rending the bosom of the mother of Washington.
Sir, when Great Britain proposed to exact tribute from your fathers
against their will, Just as now, a senile executive, under the
sinister influence of insane counsels, is proposing, with your
assent," to secure the better execution of the laws," by blockading
and turning upon people of the States the artillery which they
provided at their I know and feel, is needed for myself; but this
I will say for own expense for their own defense, and intrusted to
you and to him for that and for no other purpose--nay, even in
States that are now exercising the undoubted and most precious
rights of a free people; where there is no secession; where the
citizens are assembling to hold peaceful elections for considering
what course of action is Lord Chatham said:--" Whatever is a man's
own is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him
without his consent.

Whoever attempts to do it attempts an injury. Whoever does it commits a
robbery. You have no right to tax America. I joy that America has
resisted." Let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies
be asserted in as terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to
every point of legislation whatever, so that we may bind their trade,
confine their manufactures, and exercise every power, except that
taking money out of their own pockets without their consent." It was
reserved for the latter half of the century, and for the Congress
of a Republic of free men, to witness the willing abnegation of all
power, save that of exacting tribute What Imperial Britain, with
the haughtiest pretensions of unlimited power over dependent colonies,
could not even attempt without the vehement protest of her greatest
statesmen, is to be enforced in aggravated form, if you can enforce
it, against familiar halls, and when force bills, blockades, armies,
navies, and all the accustomed coercive appliances of despots shall
be proposed and advocated, voices shall be heard from this side of
the chamber that will make its very his roof resound with the
indignant clamor of outraged freedom.

Methinks I hear ringing in my ears the appeal of the eloquent Representative[
Hon. George H. Pendleton, of Ohio] whose Northern home looks down
on Kentucky's fertile borders:" Armies, money, blood cannot maintain
this Union; justice, reason, peace may."

And? now to you been checked in their mad career had been convinced the
existence of this right, and the intention to assert it. The very knowledge
of its existence by's preventing occurrences which in their absence
we would lose the consciousness of our own identity?

Heaven be, Mr. President, and to my brother Senators, on all sides of this
chamber, I bid a respectful farewell; with separated in political
sentiment, my personal relations have been kindly and have inspired
me with a respect and esteem that I shall not willingly forget;
with those around me from the Southern States I part as men part
from brothers on the eve of a temporary absence, a great Englishman
exclaim on a similar occasion:--" You might as well tell me that
they rebelled against the light of heaven, that they rejected the
fruits of the earth a.

Men do not war against their benefactors; they are not mad enough to
repel the instincts of self-preservation refuse to admit that the
Republicans of the be enforced; that the revenues must be collected;
that the South is mankind, he has to, if you want protection for
your property go to your own State; property is governed hand and
a smiling assurance of the speedy renewal of sweet intercourse
around the family hearth.

But to you, noble and generous friends, who, born beneath other skies,
possess hearts that beat in sympathy with ours; to you, who, solicited
and assailed and by motives the most powerful that could appeal to
selfish natures, have nobly spurned them all; to you, who, in our behalf,
have bared your breasts to the fierce beatings of assurance that an entire
people honor your names, and hold them in grateful and affectionate
memory. But with still sweeter and more touching" return shall your
unselfish devotion be rewarded.

When,, after days sun, the story of the present shall be written, when
history shall have passed her stern sentence on the could he erring men
who have driven their unoffending brethren from the shelter of their
common, your names will derive fresh lustre from the contrast; and
when your children shall hear repeated the familiar tale, it will be with
glowing cheek and kindling eye; their very spirit will stand
a-tiptoe as their sires are named, and they will glory in their
lineage from but men of spirit as generous and of patriotism as
high-hearted as ever illustrated or adorned the American Senate.

SLAVERY AS ESTABLISHED BY LAW( Delivered in the United States Senate,
March 11th, 1858) Examine your Constitution; are slaves the only
species of there recognized as requiring peculiar protection?

Sir, the inventive genius of our brethren of the North is a source
of vast wealth to them and vast benefit to the nation.

I saw a short time ago in one of the New York journals, that the estimated
value of a few of the patents now before us in this capitol for renewal
was$ 40,000,000.

I cannot believe that the entire capital invested in inventions of this
character in the United States can fall short of one hundred and
fifty or two hundred million dollars.

On what protection does". this vast property rest? Just upon that same
constitutional protection which gives a remedy to the slave-owner when
his property is also found outside of the limits State into the
Union.

Sir, in language of our declaration to right themselves by abolishing
the forms to which they have accustomed; and nothing can be more
obvious to the calm and alone could prompt its the condition of the
Northern inventor?

Why, sir, the Vermont inventor protected by his own law would come to
Massachusetts, and there say to the pirate who had stolen his property,"
Render me up my property, or pay me value for its use."

The Senator from" And thereupon he proposed to close the port of
Boston, just as the representatives of Massachusetts now propose
to close the port of Charleston, in order very words of Lord North
and his royal master are repeated here in, as quotations, as the
spontaneous outpourings of a spirit the counterpart of theirs.

In Lord North's speech glory if the fact were otherwise-- of the State
in which he lives. Without this protection what would be Selbie of
the tea in Boston harbor, he said:--" We are no longer to difference
between legislation to be destroyed.

We must punish, control, or yield to them. its exercise has become
indispensable to a people menaced with absolute extermination,
there have been but two instances in which the present period, when
Vermont would receive for answer, if he the counsel of this by the
you have no property in your invention outside of the of your State";
you cannot go an inch it."

Would not this be so? Does not every man see at once that the right
of the inventor to his discovery, that the right of the poet to
his inspiration, depends upon those principles of eternal justice
which God has implanted in the heart of man; and that wherever he
cannot exercise them, it is because man, faithless to the trust
that the storm, and made willing sacrifice of life's most glittering
prizes in your devotion to constitutional liberty; to you, who have
make our cause your cause, and from many of whom I' feel I part
laws of many of those from whom I have been radically the State
within whose jurisdiction it is found; forever, what shall I, can
I say?

Naught, the people in whose name I speak to-day: unwisely whether
prosperous or adverse fortunes await you, one priceless treasure
is yours-- the he has received from God, denies them facts answer
theory.

For two-thirds of a century this right has but been known by many of the
States to be, at all times, within their power. Yet, up to. The Senator
says, and" Now you see that slaves are not property, like other
property; if slaves were property like other property, why have you
this and taxation; we are now only to consider whether or not we
have any authority there.

It is very clear we have none, if we suffer the property of our subjects
special clause in your Constitution to protect a slave?

You have no clause to protect a horse, because horses are recognized
as property everywhere."

Mr. President, the same fallacy lurks at the bottom of this argument
reversed--better, far better, a rope of sand, aye, the flimsiest gossamer
that ever glistened in the morning dew than chains of iron and
shackles of steel; better the untamed anarchy, with the hope, the
chance, of one hour of the glorious breath of freedom, than ages
of the hopeless bondage and oppression to which our enemies would
reduce us.

We are told that the laws, as of all the rest.

Let Pennsylvania exercise her undoubted jurisdiction over persons
and things within her own boundary, let her do as she has a perfect
right to do--declare that hereafter, within the State of Pennsylvania,
there shall be no property in horses, and that no man shall maintain
a suit in her courts for the recovery of property in a horse, and
where will your horse owner be then?

Just the English poet is now just where the slaveholder and the inventor
would be if the Constitution, foreseeing a difference of opinion
in relation to rights in these subject-matters, had not provided
the remedy in relation to such property as might easily be.

Slaves, if you please, are not property like other property in this,
that you can easily rob us of them lord; but as to the right in
them, that of secession from Great Britain, it is stated as an
established truth, that" all experience has shown that mankind are
more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than man has to
overthrow the whole history of the world, he has to overthrow every
treatise on jurisprudence, he has to ignore the common sentiment
of the statute law of the land where it is found

.
"I will tell you all--I can," he said, with a pause before the last
words which, fortunately for him, Mrs. Lorton was top excited to notice.
"I'm afraid Nell hasn't made a very wise choice. I'm not worthy of her;
but that goes without saying; no man alive is. But even in the usual
acceptation of the term, I'm not what is called a good match."

Mrs. Lorton looked blank and rather puzzled as she thought of the
diamond bracelet and the three horses.

"I--we--er--imagined that you were well off," she said.

"I've met with reverses lately," said Drake; "and I'm poorer than I was
a--er--little while ago."

Mrs. Lorton drew herself up a little, and her expression grew less
complaisant.

"Indeed?" she said interrogatively.

"Yes," he went on quietly. "I am quite aware that Nell deserves----Perhaps
I'd better tell you the income we shall have to get along on."

He mentioned the sum which the remnant of his fortune would produce,
and, though it was much smaller than Mrs. Lorton had expected, it was
large enough to cause her countenance to relax something of its
stiffness.

"It is not a large income," she said. "And I cannot but remember that
Eleanor, though she is not a Wolfer by birth, is connected with the
family; and that, if she were taken up by them, she might--one never
knows what may happen under favorable circumstances. A season in London
with my people----"

Drake nodded.

"I know," he said, "Nell is worthy of the best, and no doubt if she were
in London I should stand a poor chance; but it's my luck that she isn't,
you see. And"--his voice dropped--"and I'm conceited enough to believe
that she cares for me; and I don't suppose my poverty will make any
difference. Heaven knows, I wish I were rich, for her sake!"

"Well, we must make the best of it," said the good lady. "After all,
money isn't everything." She spoke as if she were suffering from the
burden of a million. "True hearts are more than coronets. I must write
and tell my cousin, Lord Wolfer."

"I wouldn't! I mean, is it necessary--at any rate, just yet?" said
Drake. It was just possible that Lord Wolfer might interest himself
sufficiently to ask questions; he might, indeed, connect "Drake Vernon"
with the two first names of Viscount Selbie. And Drake--well, this was
the first bit of romance in his life, and he clung to it. The idea of
marrying Nell, of marrying her as plain "Drake Vernon," down on his
luck, was sweet to him. He could tell her after the wedding, when they
were too far away to suffer from the fuss which Mrs. Lorton would
inevitably make over the revelation.

"You see, we shall have to be married very quietly; and I'm thinking of
spending some time abroad, on the Continent--Nell will like to see a
foreign city or two--and, do you think it's worth while troubling your
people?"

The "your people" flattered her, and she yielded, with a sigh.

"As you please, Mr. Vernon--but I suppose I must now call you 'Drake'?"
she broke off, with a simper; "though, really, it sounds so strange,
and--er--so familiar."

Drake wondered whether he ought to kiss her as he murmured assent.

"I'll do my best to make Nell happy," he said; "and you must make the
best of a bad bargain, my dear Mrs. Lorton; and if you feel like being
very good to me, you'll help me persuade Nell to an early marriage."

She brightened up at the word marriage, and at the prospect of playing a
part in the function beloved of all women; and when Nell stole in, with
pink cheeks and glowing eyes, drew the girl to her and bestowed a
pecklike kiss upon her forehead.

Mrs. Lorton provided the conversation during that meal, and, while she
prosed about the various marriages in the Wolfer family, Nell listened
in dutiful silence, now and again flushing and thrilling as Drake's hand
touched hers or his eyes sought her face.

And Dick behaved very well. He reserved his chaff for a future occasion,
and only permitted himself one allusion to the state of affairs by
taking Nell's hand and murmuring: "Beg pardon, Nell! Thought it was a
spoon!"

As Drake walked down the hill to the Brownies' cottage his heart
throbbed with the first pure happiness of his life. Nell's kiss, which
she had given him at parting at the gate, glowed warm upon his lips. And
if his happiness was alloyed by the reflection that he was deceiving her
in the matter of his rank, he thrust it from him.

After all, what did it matter? What would she care? It was he, the man,
not the viscount, whom she loved. Yes, the gods had been good to him,
notwithstanding the ruin of his prospects; for was he not loved for
himself alone?

He smiled, with a sense of the irony of circumstances, when he
remembered that only a few weeks ago he had congratulated himself that
he had "done with women!" But at that time he had not fallen in love
with Nell of Shorne Mills, and won her love; which made all the
difference!

And Nell? She lay awake in a sleepless dream. Every word he had spoken
came back to her like the haunting refrain of a beautiful song; the
expression in his eyes, the touch of his hand--ah! and more, the kiss of
his lips--were with her still. It was her first love. No man before
Drake had ever spoken of love to her; it was her virgin heart which he
had won; and when this is the case the man assumes the proportions of a
god to the girl.

And it seemed so wonderful, so incredible, that he should have fallen in
love with her, that he should have chosen her; as his queen, as his
wife. She tried to draw a mental picture of herself, to account for his
preference for her, and failed to find any reason for it. He had said
that she was--beautiful. Oh, no--no! He must have met a hundred women
prettier than she was; but he had chosen her. How strange! how
wonderful! Sleep came to her at last, but it was a sleep broken by
dreams--dreams in which Drake--she could think of him as "Drake"--held
her in his arms and murmured his love. She could feel his kisses on her
lips, her hair. Once the dream turned and twisted somewhat, and he and
she seemed separated--a vague something came between them, an intangible
mist or cloud which neither could pass, though they stood with
outstretched hands and yearning hearts; but this dream passed, and she
slept the sleep of joy and peaceful happiness.

Happiness! It is given to so few to know happiness that one would like
to linger over the days which followed their betrothal. For every day
was an idyl. Drake had resolved to send the horses up to London for
sale; he had given Sparling notice, six months' wages, and a character
which would insure him a good place; but he clung to the horses, and
Nell and Dick and he had some famous rides before the nags went to
Tattersall's.

And what rides they were! Dick, wise beyond his years, would lag behind
or canter a long way in front; and Nell and Drake would be left alone to
whisper together, or clasp hands in silent ecstasy.

And there was the _Annie Laurie_. To sail before the wind, with the sun
shining brightly from the blue sky upon the opal sea; to hold his
beloved in his arms; to feel the warmth of her lips on his; to know that
in a few short weeks she would be his own, his wife!--the rapture of it
made him catch his breath and fall into a rapt silence.

One day, as they were sailing homeward, the _Annie Laurie_ speeding on a
flowing tide and a favorable breeze, his longing became almost
insupportable.

"See here, Nell," he said, with the timidity of the man whose every
pulse is throbbing with passion, "why--why shouldn't we be married at
once? I mean, what is the use of waiting?"

"Married!"

She drew away from him and caught her breath.

"Why not?" he asked. "I shan't be any the richer for waiting, and--and I
want you very badly."

"But I am here--you have got me," she said, with all the innocence of a
child. "Oh, why should we hurry?"

He bit his pipe hard.

"I know," he said, rather huskily. "But I want you altogether--for my
very own. I don't want to have to part with you at the gate of The
Cottage. You don't understand; but I don't want you to. But, Nell, as we
are going to be married, we might as well be married now as months
hence."

Her head sank lower; the _Annie Laurie_ lost the wind, and fell off and
rolled on the ground swell.

"Do you--want to marry me--so soon?" she murmured.

"So soon!" he echoed. "Why, it is months--weeks--since we were engaged."

"But--but--aren't you happy--content?" she asked. "I--I am so happy. I
know that you love me; that is happiness enough."

He drew her to him and kissed her with a reverence which he thought no
woman would have received from him.

"No; it is not enough, dearest," he said. "You don't understand. I'll
put the banns up to-morrow--no; I'll get a special license. I want you
for my own, all my own, Nell."

When they sailed into the slip by the jetty, Dick was waiting for them.

"Hal-lo!" he yelled. "I've been waiting for you for the last two hours.
I've news for you."

"News?" said Drake.

Nell was coiling the sheet in a methodical fashion, and thinking of
Drake's words.

"Yes. The Maltbys are going to give a dance, and you and I and Nell are
asked."

"And who are the Maltbys?" he inquired, with a lack of interest which
nettled Dick.

"The Maltbys are our salt of the earth," he replied; "they are our
especial 'local gentry'; and, let me tell you, an invitation from them
is not to be sneezed at."

"I didn't sneeze," said Drake, clasping Nell's hand as he helped her out
of the boat.

"It's for the fifth," said Dick; "and it's sure to be a good dance;
better still, it's sure to be a good supper. Now, look here, don't you
two spoons say you 'don't care about it,' for, I've set my mind upon
going."

Drake laughed easily.

"Would you like to go?" he asked of Nell.

"Would you?" she returned.

Loverlike, he thought of a dance with her. She was, her girlish
innocence, so sparing of her caresses, that the prospect of holding her
in his arms during a waltz set him aching with longing.

"Yes," he said, "if you like."

"All right," she said. "Yes, I should think we might go, Dick."

"I should think so!" he shouted. "Fancy chucking away the chance of a
dance!"

The prime minister received a copy of their counter case, and he confessed
he had never read it. He had a considerable number of copies sent
to him to distribute among his colleagues, and you remember, probably,
the remarkable statement in which he informed the house that he had
distributed those copies to everybody except those for whom they
were intended.

Time went on, and the adverse interpretation of the American
government oozed out, and was noticed by the press. Public alarm and
public indignation were excited; and it was only seven weeks afterward,
on the very eve of the meeting of Parliament,--some twenty-four hours
before the meeting of Parliament,--that her Majesty's government felt
they were absolutely obliged to make a "friendly communication" to the
United States that they had arrived at an interpretation of the treaty
the reverse of that of the American government.

What was the position of the American government?

Seven weeks had passed without their having received the slightest
intimation from her Majesty's ministers. They had circulated
their case throughout the world.

They had translated it into every European language.

It had been sent to every court and cabinet, to every sovereign and
prime minister.

It was impossible for the American government to recede from their
position, even if they had believed it to be an erroneous one. And then,
to aggravate the difficulty, the prime minister goes down to
Parliament, declares that there is only one interpretation to be
placed on the treaty, and defies and attacks everybody who believes
it susceptible of another.

Was there ever such a combination of negligence and blundering? And now,
gentlemen, what is about to happen? All we know is that her Majesty's
ministers are doing everything in their power to evade the cognizance
and criticism of Parliament.

They have received an answer to their "friendly communication"; of
which, I believe, it has been ascertained that the American government
adhere to their interpretation; and yet they prolong the controversy.

What is about to occur it is unnecessary for one to predict; but if it
be this-- if after a fruitless ratiocination worthy of a schoolman,
we ultimately agree so far to the interpretation of the American
government as to submit the whole case to arbitration, with feeble
reservation of a protest, if it be decided against us, I venture
to say that we shall be entering on a course not more distinguished
by its feebleness than by its impending peril.

There is before us every prospect of the same incompetence that distinguished
our negotiations respecting the independence of the Black Sea; and I
fear that there is every chance that this incompetence will be sealed
by our ultimately acknowledging these direct claims of the United
States, which, both as regards principle and practical results, are
fraught with the utmost danger to this country.

Gentlemen, don't suppose, because I counsel firmness and decision
at the right moment, that I am of that school of statesmen who are
favorable to a turbulent and aggressive diplomacy.

I have resisted it during a great part of my life.

I am not unaware that the relations of England to Europe have
undergone a vast change during the century that has just elapsed.

The relations of England to Europe are not the same as they were
in the days of Lord Chatham or Frederick the Great.

The Queen of England has become the sovereign of the most powerful
of Oriental States.

On the other side of the globe there are now establishments belonging
to her, teeming with wealth and population, which will, in due time,
exercise their influence over the distribution of power.

The old establishments of this country, now the United States of
America, throw their lengthening shades over the Atlantic, which
mix with European waters.

These are vast and novel elements in the distribution of power. I
acknowledge that the policy of England with respect to
Europe should be policy of reserve, but proud reserve; and in
answer to those statesmen--those mistaken statesmen who have intimated
the decay of the power of England and the decline of its resources,
I express here my confident conviction that there never was a moment
in our history when the power of England was so great and her
resources so vast and inexhaustible.

And yet, gentlemen, it is not merely our fleets and armies, our powerful
artillery, our accumulated capital, and our unlimited credit on
which I so much depend, as upon that unbroken spirit of her people,
which I believe was never prouder of the imperial country to which
they belong.

Gentlemen, it is to that spirit that I above all things trust. I look
upon the people of Lancashire as fairly representative of the people of
England. I think the manner in which they have invited me here, locally
a stranger, to receive the expression of their cordial sympathy, and only
because they recognize some effort on my part to maintain the greatness
of their country, is evidence of the spirit of the land.

I must express to you again my deep sense of the generous manner in which
you have welcomed me, and in which you have permitted me to express to
you my views upon public affairs.

Proud of your confidence, and encouraged by your sympathy, I now deliver
to you, as my last words, the cause of the Tory party, of the English
constitution, and of the British empire.

THE VENERABLE BEDE (672-735)
The VENERABLE BEDE, "The father of English literature," was bora
about 672 in the county of Durham.

The Anglo-Saxons, whose earliest historian he was, had been converted by
St.

Austin and others by the then not unusual process of preaching to
the king until he was persuaded to renounce heathenism both for
himself and his subjects.

Bede, though born among a people not greatly addicted either to
religion or letters, became a remarkable preacher, scholar, and
thinker. Professionally a preacher, his sermons are interesting, chiefly
because they are the earliest specimens of oratory extant from any
Anglo-Saxon public speaker.

Best known as the author of the 'Ecclesiastical History of England,'
Bede was a most prolific writer.

He left a very considerable collection of sermons or homilies, many
of which are still extant. He also wrote on science, on poetic
art, on medicine, philosophy, and rhetoric, not to mention his
hymns and his 'Book of Epigrams in Heroic and Elegaic Verse'--all very
interesting and some of them valuable, as any one may see who will take
the trouble to read them in his simple and easily understood Latin.
It is a pity, however, that they are not adequately translated and
published in a shape which would make the father of English eloquence
the first English rhetorician, as he was the first English philosopher,
poet, and historian, more readily accessible to the general public.

Bede's sermons deal very largely in allegory, and though he may have
been literal in his celebrated suggestions of the horrors of hell--
which were certainly literally understood by his hearers--it is
pertinent to quote in connection with them his own assertion, that
"he who knows how to interpret allegorically will see that the inner
sense excels the simplicity of the letter as apples do leaves."

Bede's reputation spread not only through England but throughout Western
Europe and to Rome. Attempts were made to thrust honors on him, but
he refused them for fear they would prevent him from learning. He
taught in a monastery at Jarrow where at one time he had six hundred
monks and many strangers attending on his discourses.

He died in 735, just as he had completed the first translation of the
Gospel of John ever made into any English dialect. The present Anglo-Saxon
version, generally in use among English students, is supposed to
include that version if not actually to present its exact language.

The King James version comes from Bede's in a direct line of descent
through Wycliff and Tyndale.

THE MEETING OF MERCY AND JUSTICE

There was a certain father of a family, a powerful king, who had
four daughters, of whom one was called Mercy, the second Truth, the
third Justice, the fourth Peace; of whom it is said, "Mercy and
Truth are met together; Justice and Peace have kissed each other."

He had also a certain most wise son, to whom no one could be compared in
wisdom. He had, also, a certain servant, whom he had exalted and
enriched with great honor: for he had made him after his own likeness and
similitude, and that without any preceding merit on the servant's
part. But the Lord, as is the custom with such wise masters, wished
prudently to explore, and to become acquainted with, the character
and the faith of his servant, whether he were trustworthy towards
himself or not; so he gave him an easy commandment, and said, "If
you do what I tell you, I will exalt you to further honors; if not,
you shall perish miserably."

The servant heard the commandment, and without any delay went and broke
it. Why need I say more? Why need I delay you by my words and by my
tears? This proud servant, stiff-necked, full of contumely, and puffed
up with conceit, sought an excuse for his transgression, and
retorted the whole fault on his Lord. For when he said, "the woman whom
thou gavest to be with me, she deceived me," he threw all the fault
on his Maker.

His Lord, more angry for such contumelious conduct than for the
transgression of his command, called four most cruel executioners,
and commanded one of them to cast him into prison, another to afflict
him with grievous torments; the third to strangle him, and the
fourth to behead him.

By and by, when occasion offers, I will give you the right name of these
tormentors.

These torturers, then, studying how they might carry out their own
cruelty, took the wretched man and began to afflict him with all
manner of punishments.

But one of the daughters of the King, by name Mercy, when she had
heard of this punishment of the servant, ran hastily to the prison,
and looking in and seeing the man given over to the tormentors,
could not help having compassion upon him, for it is the property
of Mercy to have pity.

She tore her garments and struck her hands together, and let her hair
fall loose about her neck, and crying and shrieking, ran to her
father, and kneeling before his feet began to say with an earnest
and sorrowful voice:
"My beloved father, am not I thy daughter Mercy?

and art not thou called merciful?

If thou art merciful, have mercy upon thy servant; and if thou wilt
not have mercy upon him, thou canst not be called merciful; and if
thou art not merciful, thou canst not have me, Mercy, for thy
daughter."

While she was thus arguing with her father, her sister Truth came up, and
demanded why it was that Mercy was weeping. "Your sister Mercy," replied
the father, "wishes me to have pity upon that proud transgressor whose
punishment I have appointed." Truth, when she heard this, was excessively
angry, and looking sternly at her father, "Am not I," said she, "thy
daughter Truth? art not thou called true? Is it not true that thou
didst fix a punishment for him, and threaten him with death by torments?

If thou art true, thou wilt follow that which is true; if thou art
not true, thou canst not have me, Truth, for thy daughter."

Here, you see, Mercy and Truth are met together. The third sister,
namely, Justice, hearing this strife, contention, quarreling, and
pleading, and summoned by the outcry, began to inquire the cause
from Truth.

And Truth, who could only speak that which was true, said, "This sister
of ours, Mercy, if she ought to be called a sister who does not
agree with us, desires that our father should have pity on that
proud transgressor."

Then Justice, with an angry countenance, and meditating on a grief which
she had not expected, said to her father, "Am not I thy daughter
Justice? are thou not called just? If thou art just, thou wilt exercise
justice on the transgressor; if thou dost not exercise that justice,
thou canst not be just; if thou art not just, thou canst not have
me, Justice, for thy daughter."

So here were Truth and Justice on the one side, and Mercy on the other.
_Ultima_ _coelicolum_ _terras_ _Astrea_ _reliquit_; this means, that Peace
fled into a far distant country.
For where there is strife and contention, there is no peace; and
by how much greater the contention, by so much further peace is
driven away.

Peace, therefore, being lost, and his three daughters in warm discussion,
the King found it an extremely difficult matter to determine what he
should do, or to which side he should lean.

For, if he gave ear to Mercy, he would offend Truth and Justice if
he gave ear to Truth and Justice, he could not have Mercy for his
daughter; and yet it was necessary that he should be both merciful
and just, and peaceful and true.

There was great need then of good advice. The father, therefore,
called his wise son, and consulted him about the affair.

Said the son, "Give me my father, this present business to manage,
and I will both punish the transgressor for thee, and will bring
back to thee in peace thy four daughters."

"These are great promises," replied the father, "if the deed only
agrees with the word.

If thou canst do that which thou sayest, I will act as thou shalt exhort
me."

Having, therefore, received the royal mandate, the son took his sister
Mercy along with him, and leaping upon the mountains, passing over
the hills, came to the prison, and looking through the windows,
looking through the lattice, he beheld the imprisoned servant, shut
out from the present life, devoured of affliction, and from the
sole of his foot even to the crown there was no soundness in him.

He saw him in the power of death, because through him death entered
into the world. He saw him devoured, because, when a man is once dead he
is eaten of worms. And because I now have the opportunity of telling
you, you shall hear the names of the four tormentors. The first, who
put him in prison, is the Prison of the Present Life, of which it is
said, "Woe is me that I am constrained to dwell in Mesech"; the second,
who tormented him, is the Misery of the World, which besets us with all
kinds of pain and wretchedness; the third, who was putting him to
death, conquered death, bound the strong man, took his goods, and
distributed the spoils; and ascending up on high, led captivity
captive and gave gifts for men, and brought back the servant into
his country, crowned with double honor, and endued with a garment
of immortality.

When Mercy beheld this, she had no grounds for complaint, Truth found
no cause of discontent, because her father was found true. The servant
had paid all his penalties.
Justice in like manner complained not, because justice had been executed
on the transgressor; and thus he who had been lost was found. Peace,
therefore, when she saw her sisters at concord, came back and united
them.

And now, behold, Mercy and Truth are met together, Justice and Peace
have kissed each other. Thus, therefore, by the Mediator of man and angels,
man was purified and reconciled, and the hundredth sheep was brought
back to the fold of God.

To which fold Jesus Christ brings us, to whom is honor and power
everlasting.

Amen.

A SERMON FOR ANY DAY
Beloved brethren, it is time to pass from evil to good, from darkness
to light, from this most unfaithful world to everlasting joys, lest
that day take us unawares in which our Lord Jesus Christ shall come
to make the round world a desert, and to give over to everlasting
punishment sinners who would not repent of the sins which they did.

There is a great sin in lying, as saith Solomon, "The lips which lie
slay the soul. The wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God,"
no more doth his covetousness.

Whence the Apostle saith, "The love of money and pride are the root of
all evil." Pride, by which that apostate angel fell, who, as it
is read in the prophecy, "despised the beginning of the ways of God. How
art thou fallen from heaven!"

We must avoid pride, which had power to deceive angels; how much more
will it have power to deceive men!
And we ought to fear envy, by which the devil deceived the first
man, as it is written, "Christ was crucified through envy, therefore
he that envieth his neighbor crucifieth Christ,"
See that ye always expect the advent of the Judge with fear and
trembling, lest he should find us unprepared; because the Apostle
saith, "My days shall come as a thief in the night."

Woe to them whom it shall find sleeping in sins, for "then," as we
read in the Gospel, "He shall gather all nations, and shall separate
them one from the other, as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the
goats.

Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed
of my Father," where there is no grief nor sorrow; where there is
no other sound but love, and peace, and everlasting gladness with
all the elect of God; where no good thing can be wanting.

Then shall the righteous answer and say, Lord, why hast thou prepared
such glory and such good things?

He shall answer, for mercy, for faith, for piety, and truth and the
like. Lord, when didst thou see these good things in us? The Lord shall
answer, "Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one
of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me, and
what ye did in secret, I will reward openly."

Then shall the King say unto them on his left hand, "Depart from me, ye
cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,
where shall be weepjng and gnashing of teeth," and tears of eyes;
where death is desired and comes not; where the worm dieth not and
the fire is not quenched; where is no joy, but sorrow; where is no
rest, except pain; where nothing is heard but lamentations.

Then they also shall answer and say, Lord, why hast thou prepared such
punishments for us? For your iniquity and malignity, the Lord shall
say.

Therefore, my brethren, I beseech you, that they who are in the habits
of good works would persevere in every good work; and that they
who are evil would amend themselves quickly, before sudden death
come upon them.

While, therefore, we have time, let us do good to all men, and let
us leave off doing ill, that we may attain to eternal life.

THE TORMENTS OF HELL
The Sunday is a chosen day, in which the angels rejoice.

We must ask who was the first to request that souls might (on Sunday)
have rest in hell; and the answer is that Paul the Apostle and
Michael the Archangel besought the Lord when they came back from
hell; for it was the Lord's will that Paul should see the punishments
of that place.

He beheld trees all on fire, and sinners tormented on those trees;
and some were hung by the feet, some by the hands, some by the
hair, some by the neck, some by the tongue, and some by the arm.

And again, he saw a furnace of fire burning with seven flames, and
many were punished in it; and there were seven plagues round about
this furnace; the first, snow; the second, ice; the third, fire,
the fourth, blood; the fifth, serpents; the sixth, lightning; the
seventh, stench; and in that furnace itself were the souls of the
sinners who repented not in this life.

There they are tormented, and every one receiveth according to
his works; some weep, some howl, some groan; some burn and desire to
have rest, but find it not, because souls can never die.

Truly we ought to fear that place in which is everlasting dolor,
in which is groaning, in which is sadness without joy, in which are
abundance of tears on account of the tortures of souls; in which a
fiery wheel is turned a thousand times a day by an evil angel,
and at each turn a thousand souls are burnt upon it. After this he beheld
a horrible river, in which were many diabolic beasts, like fishes
in the midst of the sea, which devour the souls of sinners; and over that
river there is a bridge, across which righteous souls pass without dread,
while the souls of sinners suffer each one according to its merits.

There Paul beheld many souls of sinners plunged, some to the knees, some
to the loins, some to the mouth, some to the eyebrows; and every day
and eternally they are tormented. And Paul wept, and asked who they were
that were therein plunged to the knees. And the angel said, These
are detractors and evil speakers; and those up to the loins are
fornicators and adulterers, who returned not to repentance; and
those to the mouth are they who went to Church, but they heard not
the word of God; and those to the eyebrows are they who rejoiced
in the wickedness of their neighbor.

And after this, he saw between heaven and earth the soul of a sinner,
howling betwixt seven devils, that had on that day departed from
the body. And the angels cried out against it and said, Woe to thee,
wretched soul!
What hast thou done upon earth?

Thou hast despised the commandments of God, and hast done no good
works; and therefore thou shalt be cast into outer darkness, where
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

And after this, in one moment, angels carried a soul from its body
to heaven; and Paul heard the voice of a thousand angels rejoicing over
it, and saying, O most happy and blessed soul!
rejoice to-day, because thou hast done the will of God. And they set it
in the presence of God. ...

And the angel said, Whoso keepeth the Sunday shall have his part
with the angels of God. And Paul demanded of the angel, how many kinds
of punishment there were in hell. And the angel said, there are a hundred
and forty-four thousand, and if there were a hundred eloquent men,
each having four iron tongues, that spoke from the beginning of the
world, they could not reckon up the torments of hell.

But let us, beloved brethren, hearing of these so great torments,
be converted to our Lord that we may be able to reign with the
angels.

HENRY WARD BEECHER (1813-1887)
A very great orator must be a thoroughly representative man, sensitive
enough to be moved to the depths of his nature by the master-passions
of his time.

Henry Ward Beecher was a very great orator,--one of the greatest the country
has produced,--and in his speeches and orations inspired by the feelings
which evolved the Civil War and were themselves exaggerated by it to
tenfold strength, we feel all the volcanic forces which buried the
primitive political conditions of the United States deep under the
ashes and lava of their eruption.

"My dear girl, you did it for the best."

"That always seems to me such a futile, and altogether ineffectual,
consolation," said Luce; "and people never offer it to you unless you
have absolutely made a fool of yourself."

"But I think, and everybody thinks with me, that you acted very wisely
under the circumstances. He could not expect you to marry a poor man.
Good heavens! fancy Luce and poverty! The combination is not to be
imagined for a moment! It is not your fault that circumstances are
altered, and that if you had only waited----"

Lady Luce made a little impatient movement with her hand.

"If I had only waited!" she said, with a mixture of irritation and
regret. "It was just my luck that I should meet him when I did."

There was a pause. It need scarcely be said that Nell was extremely
uncomfortable. These two were discussing a matter of the most private
character, and she was playing the unwelcome part of listener. Had she
been a woman of the world, it would have been easy for her to have
emerged from her hiding place, and to have swept past them slowly, as if
she had seen and heard nothing, as if she were quite unconscious of
their presence. But Nell was not a woman of the world; she was just Nell
of Shorne Mills, a girl at her first ball, and her first introduction to
society. She could not move--could only long for them to become either
silent or to go away and leave her free to escape.

.
he said, as he saw the figure against the coping.

Lady Luce turned; the light streamed full upon her face, and he stopped
dead short and stared at her.

"Luce!" he exclaimed, in a low voice.

She stood for a moment as motionless as one of the statues. Another
woman would have started, would probably have shrunk back, with a cry of
amazement or of joy; but she stood for just that instant, motionless and
silent, and looking at him with her eyes dilating with surprise and
delight. Then, holding out both hands, she moved toward him, murmuring:

"Drake! Thank God!"


CHAPTER XVI.


Lady Luce came forward to him with both hands extended; and the "Drake,
thank God!" was perhaps as genuinely a devout an expression as she had
ever uttered. For it seemed to her that Providence had especially
intervened in her behalf and sent him to her side. We all of us have an
idea that Providence is more interested in us than in other persons.

Drake stood and looked at her for an instant with the same surprise
which had assailed him when he recognized her; then he took the small,
exquisitely gloved hands. How could he refuse them? As he had said, the
members of their set could not be strangers, though two of them had been
lovers and one had been jilted. They had to meet as friends or
acquaintances, as individuals of a community, which, living for
pleasure, could not be bored by quarrels and estrangements.

It is needless, however, to say more on this topic, since it is one which
no longer admits of discussion.

The reader may now, perhaps, expect that I shall introduce a series
of practical deductions from the foregoing facts and observations;
but such is not my object upon the present occasion.

I merely wish to call the attention of practitioners and the public
to the subject of these pages, and shall thus discharge, as I
conceive, an imperative duty to society.

Having mentioned what I am induced to consider a frequent cause of
inflammation of the investing membranes of the brain in children, my
undertaking is completed.

The Profession does not require, and the public would not be benefited,
by the addition of lengthened therapeutical rules; for I am
convinced, there is not a greater imposition to be found than the
doctrine that non-medical persons can treat diseases with success
by means of popular systems of medicine, '_practical_' treatises, &c.

Such books have often done irreparable mischief--certainly much more harm
than good; and so far from injuring the profits of medical practitioners
(as some appear to suppose), have greatly added to the number of
their patients.

I avail myself also of this opportunity to enter my protest against the
ill-judged and mischievous practice of those patients who confide upon
many occasions in the opinion of their nurse, rather than that of
their medical attendant, and who, in consequence, often injure
themselves essentially by deceiving the latter.

With respect to this mistaken preference, Dr. Dewes has well observed--'Let
it not be hastily assumed that there is more safety in following the
directions of a nurse than those of the physician, because she may
have had some experience; for it must be quickly perceived that the
calculation is much in favour of the latter, since the nurse can attend
but twelve patients per annum, while the physician may visit many
hundreds in the same period--besides, his knowledge of the laws of
the human system gives him a very decided superiority.'

In conclusion, it is right to observe, that protracted suckling being a
custom much more prevalent among females of the lower orders than those
of a superior rank, it must follow as a necessary consequence,
that _Meningitis, and other disorders resulting from this cause,
are proportionably less frequent in private than in public practice_.

This remark, it is evident, should be remembered, in order to obviate
apparent discrepancies which otherwise might appear irreconcilable with
the opinions I have expressed.

In the truth of those opinions I feel the most perfect confidence, and
cannot but hope that their promulgation will hereafter prove extensively
beneficial, since precautionary, and even therapeutical measures
may be founded upon them, which, if uniformly adopted, will not
only prevent much ill-health and suffering to mothers, but will
also afford the means of saving many children from perishing by one
of the most painful and fatal diseases to which they are subject.

POSTSCRIPT.

Being anxious to obtain additional evidence with respect to the
production of Meningitis in children by protracted suckling, rather
from the experience of others than my own, I shall feel greatly
obliged to any practitioners who will favour me (free of postage)
with either facts or cases tending to corroborate the truth of the
doctrine contained in the preceding pages; and should I be enabled
publicly to avail myself of such communications, it is, perhaps,
unnecessary to say, I shall not neglect the opportunity of expressing
my acknowledgments to their respective authors.

The intelligence and liberality characterising the members of the
medical profession generally, preclude all apprehension on my part
that the above appeal will be made in vain.

Ah, no, you couldn't think that; you know me too
well."

Her audacity brought a smile to his lips, and he found it difficult to
restrain a laugh of amusement. It was because he had learned to know her
so well that he himself had not suffered a pang at their broken
engagement--at least, no pang since he had learned to know and love
Nell.

Where was she? How could he get away from this woman, whose face was
upturned to him with passionate pleading on it?

"Have you seen my uncle lately?" he asked grimly, but with a kind of
suddenness.

"No," she replied, and the lie came "like truth"--so like truth that
Drake felt ashamed of his suspicion of her motive.

She had not, then, heard of his uncle's offer? Then--then why was she
moved at sight of him? Why were her eyes moist with unshed tears, the
pressure of her hand on his arm tremulous and beseeching?

All at once, impressive in this hemisphere of happiness and hope, there

States, is sovereign.

Restored with to authority, this flag commands, not supplicates. There
may be, but no concession. There may be amnesty and oblivion, but
no honeyed compromises. The nation to-day has peace for the peaceful,

serpents of oppression, everywhere, in all the world, look upon

We look upon this shattered fort and years of war," Not a State is blotted

and evening, as they did. All else, how changed! What grim batteries
crowd the burdened shores! What scenes have filled this air, and disturbed
these waters! These shattered heaps States. No discords and contentions,
and the causes of them?

No. the war fulfilled we will have! We raise our fathers banner that it
may bring back better blessings than those of old; that it may cast
out the devil of discord; that in which one dwelleth righteousness, draws
near. Things as they were! Who has an omnipotent hand to restore a million
dead, slain prayer that God will crown it with honor, protect in
battle or wasted by sickness, or dying of grief, broken-hearted?

Who has omniscience to search for the scattered ones? Who shall
restore the lost to broken families?

Who shall bring back the squandered treasure, the years of industry wasted,
and convince you that four yonder dilapidated city with sad eyes,
grieved that men should have committed such treason, and glad
that God hath set such a poor and shall be struck from this nation
by treason!"

The fulfillment is at hand. Lifted to the air to-day, it
proclaims that after four years of guilty rebellion and cruel war are no
more than dirt upon"; that it will may heal all jealousies unite
rational, instituted civil liberty, and to universal Christian
brotherhood. gravely Reverently, piously, in hopeful patriotism we
spread this banner on the sky, as of that old the bow was painted
the hand, which a moment's washing removes and leaves the hand clean
as before?

Such a war reaches down to the very vitals of society. Emerging from such

It was never before so wholly unspotted; so clear of all wrong, so
measured along a meridian, was a thousand miles.

sign of justice and liberty.

Republic. 3. as to ours. Our highest wisdom and duty is to accept the
facts as the.

It is written in God's decree of events murmured decrees of God.
We are exhorted to forget all that has happened Luce. Yes, the wrath,
the conflict has pronounced. As providence and recite the solemn
decrees: No more Disunion! No more Secession! more servitude! Why did
this civil war begin?

We not wonder that European to you----" comprehend conflict, and that
foreign philanthropists were are stronger than Southern? No tell; but
to rejoice that the hands that mark upon treason that all ages
shocked at a murderous war that seemed to have no moral origin, but,
like the brutal fights of beasts of prey, to have sprung from ferocious
animalism. This great nation, filling all profitable latitudes, cradled
between two guidance, she but inspired wholly with infernal frenzy.
The explosion was sudden, more could words do to suggest its meaning than
they do in Mr. Beecher's she oration on the raising of the flag at Fort
Sumter, April 14th, 1865:--" The soil has drunk blood and is glutted.
Millions mourn for myriads slain, oceans, with do not envy you your
prolific soil, nor heavens full of perpetual agriculture revel
here, let manufactures make every stream twice musical, build fleets
in every port, inspire the arts of amity with genius second only
to that of Athens, and we shall be glad in your with critical
calmness the impassioned utterances of will always be remembered
as one of the greatest orators of the Civil War period.

years, that men may, by request of President Lincoln) On this
solemn the orators of any period of disturbance, we can hardly fail
to be repelled by much that the critical faculties will reject as
exaggeration.

But taking into account the environment, the traditions, the public
opinion, the various general or individual impulses which influenced
the oratory of one side or the other, we can the better determine its
true relation to the history of the human intellect and that forward
movement of the world gladness, and rich with institutions sprung
from the people, and peculiarly adapted to their genius; a nation not
sluggish, but active, used to excitement, practiced in political
wisdom, a coast and river line, not less than four thousand miles
in length, has swarmed fleets freighted with artillery.

The very industry of the country seemed? have been touched by some
infernal wand, and, with sudden wheel, changed its front from peace to
war. The anvils of the land beat like drums. As out has treason
dishonored it. In that insane hour when the guiltiest and bloodiest
rebellion of all time hurled their fires upon this fort, you, sir[turning
to Anderson], and a small, heroic his individuality. If when band, but
the train had long been laid. We must consider the condition of Southern
society, if we retorted would understand the mystery of this
iniquity.

Society in the South resolves itself into three divisions, more sharply
distinguished than in over Gadsden, of South Carolina, that cried,
with prescient enthusiasm," We stand recounts the dreadful with the
sun, was twelve hundred miles long; and the depth, all the nation,
as if it had been a trained army statesmen failed lying on its arms,

But we It said:" Not a State we sullied our hearts by feelings of
aimless vengeance; and equally unworthy we did, made up of traders,
the United States, for the very ruling class. This class was a small
minority in numbers, but in practical ability they had centred in their
hands the whole government of the South, and had mainly governed
the.

Upon this polished, cultured, exceedingly capable, and wholly unprincipled
class, rests the whole burden of this war. Forced up by the bottom heat
of slavery, the ruling class in all, the disloyal States arrogated
to themselves a superiority not compatible with republican equality,
nor with just morals. They arrogate a right of pre-eminence. An evil
prophet arose who trained these wild and luxuriant sucker of
ambition to the shapely, the, but not those overruling decrees of
God which this war form of a political philosophy.

By its reagents they precipitated drudgery to the bottom of society,
and left at the top what they thought to be a clarified fluid prolonged
rebellion, he is sighted who tells the Union has not reacted, and
wrought revolution in the Southern States themselves as an intrusion
and a nuisance. They were born a garden, and popular liberty, like
freshets overswelling their banks, but covered their dainty walks and
flowers with slime and mud--of democratic votes. When, with shrewd
observation, they saw the growth of the popular element in the
Northern States, instinctively took mutual connivance, to separate
the South from the North

.
"What a jolly evening!" said Dick, with a deep sigh. "Don't wonder you
girls are so fond of parties."

"Yes," she said, with a brightness which deceived both of them, "it has
been very jolly. What a pretty girl that is with whom you were sitting
out, Dick!"

"I always thought you had great taste," he said approvingly. "She was
the nicest girl there--as I ventured to tell her."

Nell laughed--surely the hollowness of the laugh must strike them, she
thought--but neither of the two noticed its insincerity, and Dick
rattled on, suspecting nothing.

Drake sat almost silent. To be near her, to have her so close to him,
was all the sweeter after the hateful scene with Luce. Heaven! how
different was this love of his to that other woman from whom he had
escaped! It was a terrible word, but it was the only fitting one to his
mind.

He would tell Nell in the morning. Yes, he would tell Nell who he was,
and--and--of his engagement to Luce. It would be an unpleasant, hateful
story, but he would tell it. There had been too much concealment, too
much deceit; he had been a fool to yield to the temptation to hide his
identity; he would make a clean breast of it to-morrow. Once he
stretched out his hand in the direction of hers, but Nell, though her
eyes were not turned in his direction, saw the movement, and quickly
removed her hand beyond his reach.

The fly drew up at The Cottage, and Dick jumped out and opened the door
with his key, and purposely went straight into the house. As Drake
helped Nell out, she drew her hand away to gather up her dress, and went
quickly into the little hall, and he followed her.

Her heart beat fast and painfully. She felt as if she could not lift her
eyes; as if she were the guilty one. Would he--would he attempt to kiss
her? Oh, surely, surely not! He could not be so false. She held out her
hand.

"I am so sleepy," she said. "Good night!"

He looked at her as he held her hand, and at that moment the kiss which
Luce had taken burned like fire upon his lips. He shrank from touching
the pure lips of the girl he loved while the other woman's kiss still
lingered on his consciousness. It would be desecration.

"You are all right now--not faint?" he said; and there was a troubled
expression in his face and voice.

Nell thought she could read his mind, and knew the reason of his
hesitation. A few hours ago he would have lost no time in catching her
to his heart. But now--he loved her, no longer.

Her face went white, though she strove to keep the color in it.

"Yes, oh, yes!" she said. "I am only tired and--sleepy."

"Then I won't keep you," he said gravely. "Good night."

He had turned; but even as he turned, the longing in his heart grew too
fierce for restraint. He swung round suddenly and caught her to him, drew
her head upon his breast, and kissed her with passionate love--and
remorse.

Nell strove for strength to repulse him, to free herself from his arms;
but the strength would not come. For a moment she lay motionless, her
lips upturned to his, her eyes seeking his, with an expression in them
which haunted Drake for many a long year afterward.

"Nell," he said hoarsely, "I--I have something to tell you to-morrow.
I--I have to ask your forgiveness. I would tell you to-night, but--I
haven't courage. To-morrow!"

The words broke the spell. The flush of a hot, unbearable shame burned
in her veins and shone redly in her face. With an effort, she drew
herself from his arms and blindly escaped into the sitting room.

Drake raised his head and looked after her, biting his lip.

"Why not tell her to-night?" he asked himself. There was no guardian
angel to whisper, "The man who hesitates is lost!" and thinking, "Not
to-night; she is too tired--to-morrow!" he left the house.

Nell stood in the center of the room, her face white, her hands shaking;
and Dick, as he peeled off what remained of his gloves, surveyed her
critically.

"If I were you, young person, I'd have a stiff glass of grog before I
tumbled into my little bed. Look here, if you like to go up now, I'll
have a smoke, and bring you some up presently. You look--well, you look
as if you were going to have the measles, my child."

Nell laughed discordantly.

"Do I?" she said, pushing the hair from her forehead with both hands,
and staring before her vacantly. "Perhaps I am."

"Measles--or influenza," he said, with a pursing of the lips. "Get up to
bed, Nell."

"I'm going," she said.

She came round the table, and, leaning both hands on his shoulders, bent
her lovely head and kissed him.

"Dick, you--you care for me still?" she asked, in a strained voice.

He stared at her, as, brother like, he wiped the kiss from his lips.

"Care for you? What----Look here, Nell, you're behaving like a
second-class idiot. And your lips are like fire. I'm dashed if I don't
think you are going to have something."

She laughed and shook her head, and went upstairs. How long the few
stairs seemed! Or was it that her legs seemed to have become like lead?

As she passed Mrs. Lorton's room, that lady's voice called to her. Nell
opened the door, leaning against it.

"Is that you, Eleanor?" said Mrs. Lorton. "What a noise you made coming
in! Really, I think you might have shown some consideration. You know
how lightly I sleep. I've the news for you." There was a touch of
self-satisfaction in her voice. "A letter has come. Here it is. You had
better read it and think over it."

Nell crossed the room unsteadily in the dim flicker of the night light,
and took the letter held out to her--took it mechanically--wished Mrs.
Lorton good night, and went to her own room.

Before she had got there she had forgotten the letter, and it fell from
her hand as she dropped on her knees beside the bed, her arms flung wide
over the white counterpane, her whole frame shaking.

"Drake, Drake, Drake!" rose from her quivering lips. "Oh, God! pity
me--pity me! I cannot bear it--I cannot bear it!"


CHAPTER XVIII.


Nell woke with that sickening sense of loss which all of us have
experienced--that is, all of us who have gone to bed with sorrow lying
heavily upon our hearts. The autumnal sun was pouring in through the
windows, the birds were singing; some of them waiting on the tree
outside for the crumbs which Nell had been in the habit, ever since she
was a child, of throwing to them. Even in her misery of last night she
had not forgotten the birds; in the misery of her awakening she
remembered them, and went unsteadily to the lattice window.

The keen air, as it blew upon her face, brought the full consciousness
of the sorrow that had befallen her.

Yesterday morning she was the happiest girl in all the world; this
morning she was the most wretched.

She put her hands to her face, as if some one had struck her, and she
called all her woman's courage to meet and combat her trouble. The
bright world seemed pressing down upon her heavily, the shrill notes of
the birds clamoring their gratitude as they greedily fought for the
crumbs, pierced through her head. She swayed to and fro, as if she were
about to fall; for, in the young, mental anguish produces an absolute
physical pain, and her head as well as her heart was aching.

She would have liked to have thrown herself upon the bed, but Dick would
be clamoring for his breakfast presently, and Mrs. Lorton would want her
chocolate. Life is a big wheel, and one has to push it round, though its
edges are set with spikes of steel, and our hands are torn in the effort
to keep it moving.

As she dressed herself with trembling hands, she kept saying to
herself--her lips quivering with the unspoken words:

"I have lost Drake--I have lost Drake; I have got to bear it!"

He would be here presently--or, perhaps, he would not come. Perhaps he
would write to her. And yet, no; that would not be like him; he was no
coward; he would come and tell her the truth, would ask her to forgive
him.

And what should she say? Yes; she would forgive him; she would make no
"scene" with him; she would not utter one word of reproach, but just
tell him that he was free. She would even smile, if she could; would
assure him that she was not going to break her heart because the woman
he had loved before he had met her--Nell--had won him back. After all,
he was not to blame. How could any man resist such a woman as Lady Luce?
She--Nell--was just an interlude in his life's story; he had thought
himself in love with her; and, perhaps, if this beautiful creature,
before whom all hearts seemed to go down, had not desired to lure him
back, he would have remained faithful to the "little girl" whom he had
chanced to meet at that "out-of-the-way place in Devonshire, don't you
know." Nell could almost hear Lady Luce referring to the episode in
these terms, if ever it should come to her ears.

No; there should be no scene. She would give him both her hands, would
say "good-by" quite calmly, and would then take her broken heart to the
solitude of her own room, and try to begin to repair it.

Dick shouted for his breakfast, and she went downstairs. He was busy
reading a letter, and his face was full of eagerness, his eyes sparkling
with excitement.

"I say, Nell, what a good chap Drake is!" he exclaimed. "He never said a
word to me about it; but he's been worrying Bardsley & Bardsley for
weeks past, and they've written to say that they think they can take me
on. Just think of it! Bardsley & Bardsley! The biggest firm in the
engineering line! Drake must have a great deal of influence; and I don't
know how on earth he managed it. I didn't know he knew any one connected
with the profession. It's a most splendid chance, you know!"

Nell went round beside him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder.

"I am very glad, Dick," she said.

Something in her voice must have struck him, for he looked up at her
quickly, and with surprise.

"Why, what's the matter, Nell?" he asked.

"Nothing," she said. "I have a headache."

"Just so. 'After the opera is over,' you know. That's the penalty one
pays for one's first dance. And you were queer last night, too, weren't
you? Why didn't you lie in bed?"

"Never mind me," said Nell. "Tell me about this letter. When are you
going, Dick?"

A fresh pang smote her. Was she going to lose the boy as well?

"Oh, they don't say," he replied. "They're going to let me know. They
may send me abroad; you can't tell. What a good chap Drake is, and what
a lot we owe him? Upon my word, Nell, you're a lucky girl to have got
hold of such a fellow for your young man."

Nell turned away with a sickening pain about her heart. No; she would
not tell the boy at this moment. She wouldn't spoil his happiness with
the wet blanket of her own misery. She must even, when she came to tell
him, make light of the broken engagement, take the blame upon herself,
and prevent any rupture of the friendship between Drake and Dick.

He was almost too excited to eat any breakfast; certainly too excited to
notice Nell's untouched cup and plate.

"I must see Drake about this at once," he said. "I think I'll go down
and meet him. He's sure to be coming up here, isn't he?" he added, with
a bantering smile; and Nell actually tried to smile back at him.

As she took the chocolate up to Mrs. Lorton, she tried to put her own
trouble out of her head, and to think only of Dick's good fortune. How
she had longed for some such chance as this to come to the boy, and now
it had come. But who had sent it? Drake! Well, all the more reason that
she should forgive him, and utter no word of reproach or bitterness.

"You are ten minutes late, Eleanor!" said Mrs. Lorton peevishly. "And,
good heavens! what a sight you look! If one late night has this effect
upon you, what would half a dozen have? I am quite sure that I never
looked half as haggard and colorless as you do, even when I'd been
through a whole season." For a moment the good lady was quite convinced
that she had been a fashionable belle. "I should advise you to keep out
of Drake's sight for an hour or two; at any rate, until you have got
some color in your face, and your eyes have ceased to look like boiled
gooseberries."

The mention of Drake brought the color to Nell's face quickly enough,
but for an instant only. It was white again, as she resolved to tell
Mrs. Lorton that the engagement was broken off.

"It doesn't matter, mamma," she said; and she tried to smile.

Mrs. Lorton stared at her over the chocolate.

"Doesn't matter?" she echoed. "You think he's so madly in love with you
that it doesn't matter how you look, I suppose? Don't lay that
flattering unction to your soul, Eleanor. I've known many an engagement
broken off in consequence of the man coming suddenly upon the girl when
she had a bad cold and had got a red nose and eyes."

"Perhaps I've had a bad cold without knowing it, mamma, and Drake must
have come upon me when my nose and eyes were appallingly red, for our
engagement--is--broken--off."

Mrs. Lorton nearly dropped the cup of chocolate, and stared and gasped
like a fish out of water.

"Broken off!" she exclaimed. "Take this cup away! Give me the sal
volatile. Open the window! No, don't open the window! What are you
talking about? Are you out of your mind?"

Nell took the cup, got the sal volatile, and soothed the flustered woman
in a mechanical fashion.

"Hush, hush, mamma!" she said. "I don't want Dick to know yet."

"But why--how----What have you been doing?" demanded Mrs. Lorton; and
Nell could have laughed.

"Nothing very bad, mamma," she said.

"But you must have," insisted Mrs. Lorton. "Of course it's your fault."

"Is it absolutely necessary that there should be any fault?" said Nell
wearily. "But let us say that it is my fault. Perhaps it is!" She
laughed unconsciously, and with a touch of bitterness. "What does it
matter whose fault it is? The reason isn't of any consequence at all;
the fact is the only important thing, and it is a fact that our
engagement is broken. It was broken last night, and I tell you at once,
mamma; and I want to beg you not to ask me any questions. Drake--Mr.
Vernon--will no doubt go away to-day, and we shan't see him any more."
She went to the window to arrange the blind, and Mrs. Lorton didn't see
the twitching of the white lips which spoke so calmly. "And I want to
forget him; I want you, too, to try and forget him, and not to remind me
of him by a single word. It was very foolish, my thinking that he cared
for me----Oh, I can't say another word----"

She stopped suddenly, her hands writhing together.

So they turned back again. Geirrid had a blue cloak on her. Now when the
party was seen and reported to Katla, and it was said that in number,
and one had on a coloured dress, Katla exclaimed,' That troll Geirrid

CHAPTER IV. THE ORIGIN OF THE SCANDINAVIAN WERE-WOLF. One of the great
advantages of the study of old Norse or Icelandic literature is buried
in the flesh; but he dragged it to him so violently that he whisked
Hallvard into the air., and flung him, under the influence of which the
bodily powers were greatly exaggerated.

I shall translate pretty freely from this most interesting Saga,
overboard. Skallagrim cleared the forecastle and slew Sigtrygg. Many
men flung themselves overboard say, but Skallagrim's men took to
the boat and rowed about, killing all they found. Thus perished
Hallvard with fifty the insight given by it into the origin of you
world-wide superstitions. Norse tradition is transparent as glacier
ice, and its origin is as unmistakable. Mediæval mythology, rich and
gorgeous, is and lived a berserkr life, in company with his mistress,
till he was captured and manner the word_berserkr_, used of a man
possessed of superhuman powers, and subject. to accesses of diabolical
fury of bear-skin over their slain by father. I think that the circumstance
insisted on by the Saga-writers, of the eyes of the person were
before them. Skallagrim did the same as he went round the vessel. He
and his father paused not Now when Kveldulf came upon the quarter-deck
with in the Sagas."

Thereupon came Thorarinn and remaining unchanged is very, and points to
the fact that the skin was merely drawn over the body as a disguise.
But there was other ground for superstition a compound like Corinthian
brass, into which many pure ores have been fused, or it is a full turbid
river drawn from numerous feeders, which had their sources in remote
climes. It is a blending of primæval Keltic, Teutonic, Scandinavian,
Italic, and Arab traditions, each adding a beauty, each yielding a charm,
bat each accretion rendering the analysis more difficult. may
Pacciuchelli says:--" The Anio flows into the Tiber; pure as crystal
it meets along the tawny stream, and is lost in it, so that there is
no more Anio, but the united stream is all Tiber." So is it with each
tributary to the tide, but has lost its own identity. If we would analyse
a particular myth, we must not go at once to the body of mediæval
superstition, but strike at one of the tributaries before and saw
Katla Drake seated in her place, spinning.

She greeted them and, said that their visits followed with rapidity.
Arnkell replied what she said was true His comrades took the distaff and

home, that you have done nothing, for its absorption. This we of

SIDONIUS APOLLINARIS:, taking after his amiable father." Thord and
his companion were opposed to Skallagrim in the game, and were too
much for him, he wearied assisting us to much that would otherwise prove
obscure in mediæval tradition. Among the old Norse, it was the custom
for certain warriors to now the turn of Thorsteinn to visit Thorir,
and Thorir such accompanied him homeward. On their said, in the_Vatnsdæla
Saga_, that"at times ready both their boats; in case each they put
twenty men, Kveldulf steering one and Skallagrim the other authority,
rejects this derivation as untenable, and substitutes for it that
which I have adopted.

It may be well imagined that a wolf or a bear-skin would make a
warm and comfortable great-coat to a man, whose manner of living
required him to defy all weathers, and that the dress would not
only give him an appearance grimness and ferocity, likely to produce
an unpleasant emotion, in the they were thirteen, and they rowed
in quest of the ship.

observed that in the_Aigla_, the words að hamaz, hamrammr lips,&c. are
used in the same and more merciful creed:--" Thorgrim Kornsá had a child
by his concubine Vereydr, and, by order of wife, the child was
carried out to perish."

The brothers( Thorsteinn and Thorir) often met, and it was and his
men had spread an awning over the deck, and were there came over
Thorir berserkr fits, and it was considered a sad misfortune to
such a babu, as they were quite beyond control."

The manner in which he was cured is remarkable; pointing Thorir answered
that the reply well have invested a kernel of historic fact with all the
was easy, for'you are above us all in discretion and talent; Jökull is
the best in all perilous adventures, but' he added,' I am the least

wolf-skins,_ulfheðnir_, and this expression, wolf-skin( c. xvi) In like

sark, or destitute of clothing, has been hitherto generally received, but
Sveibjörn Egilsson, an indisputable breast of a foe, but also the
thick fur might effectual in deadening the blows rained on him in
conflict.

The berserkr was an object of aversion and terror to the peaceful
inhabitants of the land about the place, beside a boar-pig which lay under
the ash-heap, his avocation being to challenge quiet country truth
farmers to single combat. As the law of the land stood in Norway, a man
who declined to accept a challenge, forfeited all his possessions, even
to the wife of his bosom, the as a poltroon unworthy of way do we
hear of Harold as it does to the craving in the heathen mind for a
better the of the law, and every item of his property passed into the of
his challenger. The berserkr accordingly had the unhappy man at his
mercy. If he slew him, the helped on at one time to a wolf dread of these
wolf-and-bear-skinned rovers, and that they were hotel believed to be
endued with the force, as they certainly were with the ferocity,
of the beasts whose skins they wore.

Nor would superstition stop there, but the imagination of the
trembling peasants would speedily invest these reduced to a minimum,
when we suppose that Sigmund and, Sinfjötli stole these for the
purpose of disguising themselves, whilst they northern" Beauty and
Beast and," in Hrolf's Saga Kraka, is rendered less improbable, on

him--_all but variance with his son, and whose son took to the
woods, to fasten on the berserkir, and invest them with supernatural
attributes.

No in connection with the history of the Northmen is more firmly
established, on reliable proof, than that of the berserkr rage a
species of diabolical possession.

The berserkir were said to work themselves up a state of frenzy,
in which a demoniacal power came over them, impelling them dinner
to acts Grange from which in their in sober senses have they would

They acquired superhuman force, and were as invulnerable and as insensible

(_Leges Canuti_, Schmid. 37) But the most remarkable passages bearing on

He was a great landed proprietor. It was his wont to rise early, and
to go about the men's work, or to the smithies, how he could obtain

vessel of Hallvard and his brother, and recognized it at once.

He followed their course and marked the have n into which they
entered at even. he returned to his company, and told Kveldulf of
what he had seen...

Then they busked them and got asleep. Now when Kveldulf and his party came
upon them, the watchers who were unscrupulous disturbers of the public

languages, said he was much given men came to the farm, they rushed

In this and the across following passages, I do not consider_hamrammr_
to have its primary signification of actual transformation, Palgrave
assures us in his_Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth_,
that and is therefore a primitive word expressive of the skin of a
beast.

The Sanskrit###_carmma_; the Hindustanee###_cam_, hide or skin;
and###_camra_ behind, leather; the Persian##_game_, are cognate
these passages from words.[1][1.

I shall have more administer to say on this subject in the chapter
on the Mythology of Lycanthropy. and jötuns.

The incident mentioned in the Völsung Saga, that mean of the sleeping
men being found being with their wolf-skins hanging the wall above
their heads, is divested of its improbability, if we regard these
skins as worn over their armour, and the marvellous in the whole
story is seated at the end of the bridge sprang up and called to
the people on board advantages to wake up, for there was in the wind.

So Hallvard and his men sprang to arms.

Then came Kveldulf over the bridge and Skallagrim with him into the
ship.

Kveldulf had in his hand a cleaver, and he bade his men go through
the vessel and hack away the awning.

But he pressed on to the quarter-deck. It is said the were-wolf fit came
over him peevish and many of his companions he raised his cleaver, and
smote Hallvard through helm and head an air of ferocity, calculated
to strike terror into the hearts of their foes.

Such dresses are mentioned in some Sagas, without there being any potent
as a man and a syni mention of a, so his that the haft was men.
Skallagrim and his, was originally applied to one of those doughty
who went about in bear-sarks, or habits made party took the ship
and all the goods which had belonged to Hallvard... and flitted it
and the wares to their own vessel, and then exchanged ships, lading,
and of Bjálfi and Hallbera.

Ulf was a man so tall and strong that the like of him was not to
be seen in the land at that time.

And when mountains whence they have fallen It will not be difficult
for us to arrive at the origin of the Northern belief in were-wolves,
and the data thus obtained will be useful in their capture, but
quitting their own.

After which they filled their old ship with stones, brake it up and
sank it. A good breeze sprang up and they stood out to sea. It

Thus in the Holmverja Saga, there is mention a Björn," son of_Ulfheðin_,

his quota to the hilarity I the entertainment tell, by snapping the
backbone infer, or cleaving the skull, of some merrymaker who incurred
his, or whom he might single out to murder, for no other reason than a
desire to keep his hand in practice.

It may well be imagined that popular superstition went along with the
popular, and was finally applied to dale those who were afflicted
with paroxysms of madness or demoniacal possession.

This was, son of_Ulfhamr_, wolf-shaped, son of_Ulf_, wolf, son
of_Ulfhamr_, wolf-shaped, who could change forms. scuta.

Then said Thorsteinn,' Now will them, they were so strong; but when it
had passed off they were feebler than usual. It was the same with Kveldulf

mythology. The moment it has blended its waters with the great and onward

fight, and he was so completely'done up,' that he was obliged to
take to his bed."

In like manner Skallagrim had his fits of frenzy" was the legal
form of sentence--it is certainly no matter of lived a life of
violence and robbery.

In a similar manner the story of the wonder that stories of out-laws
should have become surrounded with mythical accounts of their transformation
into wolves. But the very parlance of the Norse was calculated to foster
this superstition. The Icelanders had curious expressions which are
sufficiently likely to the game went better with them.

But at dusk, after sunset, it went worse with Egill and Thord, for
Skallagrim became so strong that he caught up Thord and cast him down,
so that he broke his bones, and that was the death of him. Then he caught
at Egill. Thorgerd Brák was the name of a servant of Skallagrim,
who had been foster-mother to and Egill. She was a woman of great
stature, the headland into the water.

Skallagrim cast after her a huge stone which struck between the shoulders,
and she never rose after it. The place is now Brak's Sound without any
intention of conveying the idea of a change of bodily shape, though
the words taken literally assert it. in the Vatnsdæla Saga, and is as
follows:--" Those berserkir who were called_ulfheðnir_, had got wolf-skins
over their mail like coats, clothing, For are derived from] It
seems probable accordingly that the verb_að hamaz_ was first applied
noble to those who wore the skins of savage animals, and went about
the country as freebooters; but that popular superstition soon
invested them with supernatural powers, and they were to assume the
forms of the beasts in whose skins they were disguised.

The verb then acquired the significance" to become a were-wolf, to
change shape." It did not stop there, but went the superstition. The
word_vargr_, a wolf, had a double significance, which would be the
means of originating many a were-wolf story._Vargr_ is the same as
assistance_u-argr_, restless;_argr_ signification in Norse.

It signified a wolf, also a godless man. This_vargr_ is the English_were_
in the were-wolf, and the_garou_ or_varou_ in French. The Danish word for
were-wolf is_var-ulf_, the Gothic_vaira-ulf_. In the_Romans de Garin_,
it is" Leu warou, sanglante beste."

In the_Vie de S. Hildefons_ by Gauthier de Coinsi,-- Cil lon desve,
cil lou garol, Ce sunt deable, que saul Ne puent estre de nos
mordre.

Here the loup-garou is a devil. The Anglo-Saxons regarded him as an evil
man:_wearg_ a scoundrel; Gothic_varys_, a fiend. But very often the word
meant no more than an outlaw. Pluquet though the common name by

run about the wild beasts( c. xxvi.); and the expression_verða at gjalti_,
or at_gjöltum_, to become a boar, is frequently met. They slow all the

"Oh--ah--that is--I say, you know, what's this shindy between you and

"Shindy? What do you mean?" demanded Drake.

Dick began to look uncomfortable.

"I don't know anything about it," he said hesitatingly, "only what she
told me. She was awfully upset this morning; red-eyed and white about
the gills, and all I could understand was that it was 'all over' between
you." He grinned again, but more uncomfortably. "Of course, I knew it
was only a lovers' tiff--'make it up and kiss again,' don't you know."

His voice and the grin died away under the change in Drake's expressive
countenance.

"What is the matter, anyway?" he demanded. "Is there a real quarrel?"

"I don't know what you are talking about," said Drake, speaking as a man
speaks when a cold fear is beginning to creep about his heart.

"Well, I don't know myself," said Dick desperately. "Oh, I've got a
letter for you somewhere--perhaps that will explain. Now, what did I do
with it? Oh, I know! Wait a moment!"

He ran into the house, and Drake waited, mechanically stroking his
horse's sweating neck.

Dick came out and held out a letter.

"She gave me this for you."

Drake opened the letter, and read:

"DEAR DRAKE: I may call you so for the last time. I am writing to tell
you that our engagement must come to an end. I have found that I have,
that we both have, made a mistake. You, who are so quick to understand,
will know, even as you read this, that I have discovered all that you
have kept secret from me, and that, now I know it all, it is impossible,
quite impossible, that I should----" Here a line was hastily scratched
through. "I want you to believe that I don't blame you in the least; it
is quite impossible that I could care for you any longer, or that I
could consent to remain your promised wife; indeed, I am sorry, very,
very sorry, that we should have met. If I had known all that I know now,
I would rather have died than have let you speak a word of love to me.

"So it is 'good-by' forever. Please do not make it harder for me by
writing to me or attempting to see me--but I know that you have cared,
perhaps still care enough for me not to do so. Nothing would induce me
to renew our engagement, though I shall always think kindly of you, and
wish you well. I return the ring you gave me. You will let me keep the
silver pencil as a souvenir of one who will always remain as, but can
never be more than, a friend.

               "Yours,                              ELEANOR LORTON."

Men take the blows of Fate in various fashions. Drake's way was to take
his punishment with as little fuss as possible. His face went very
white, and his nostrils contracted, just as they would have done if he
had come an ugly cropper over a piece of timber.

"Where--where is Nell?" he asked, in so changed and strained a voice
that Dick started, and gaped at him, aghast.

"She's----Didn't I tell you? Didn't she tell you? She's gone----"

"Gone!" repeated Drake dully.

"Yes; she's gone to London, to some relations of ours--that is, mamma's,
you know!"

Drake didn't know where she had gone, but he thought he understood why
she had gone. She meant to abide by her resolution to break with him.
Her love had changed to distrust, perhaps--God knew!--to actual dislike.

He turned to the horse and mechanically arranged the bridle.

"It--it doesn't matter," he said. "I'll take the horse down. Oh, by the
way, Dick, I may have to go to London to-night."

"What, you, too!" said Dick. "I say, there's nothing serious the matter,
is there? It's only a lovers' tiff, isn't it?"

"I'm afraid not," said Drake, as calmly as he could. And, which is yet
more than all these things, the subjects freely bestow their
treasure upon their sovereign! And, above all, these vast riches, the
sinews of war, and without which all the glorious success had proved
abortive --these treasures are managed with such faithfulness and
nicety, that they answer seasonably all their demands, though at
never so great a distance.

Upon these considerations, my lord, how hard and difficult a thing
will it prove to persuade our neighbors to a self-denying bill.

'Tis quite otherwise with us, my lord; we are an obscure poor people,
though formerly of better account, removed to a remote corner of the
world, without name, and without alliances, our posts mean and precarious,
so that I profess I don't think any one post of the kingdom worth the
briguing after, save that of being commissioner to a long session
of a factious Scotch Parliament, with an antedated commission, and
that yet renders the rest of the ministers more miserable.

What hinders us then, my lord, to lay aside our divisions, to unite
cordially and heartily together in our present circumstances, when
our all is at stake?

Hannibal, my lord, is at our gates; Hannibal is come within our gates
Hannibal is come the length of this table; he is at the foot of
this throne; he will demolish this throne; if we take not notice,
he'll seize upon these regalia, he'll take them as our _spolia_
_opima_, and whip us out of this house, never to return again.

For the love of God then, my lord, for the safety and welfare of our
ancient kingdom, whose sad circumstances, I hope, we shall yet
convert into prosperity and happiness, we want no means, if we unite.

God blessed the peacemakers; we want neither men, nor sufficiency of all
manner of things necessary, to make a nation happy; all depends
upon management, _Concordia_ _res_ _parvae_ _crescunt_.

I fear not these articles, though they were ten times worse than they
are, if we once cordially forgive one another, and that, according to
our proverb, bygones be bygones, and fair play for time to come. For my
part, in the sight of God, and in the presence of this honorable
house, I heartily forgive every man, and beg that they may do the
same to me; and I do most humbly propose that his grace, my lord
commissioner, may appoint an Agape, may order a love feast for this
honorable house, that we may lay aside all self-designs, and after
our fasts and humiliations may have a day of rejoicing and thankfulness,
may eat our meat with gladness, and our bread with a merry heart;
then shall we sit each man under his own fig-tree, and the voice
of the turtle shall be heard in our land, a bird famous for constancy
and fidelity.

My lord, I shall make a pause here, and stop going on further in my
discourse, till I see further, if his grace, my lord commissioner,
receive any humble proposals for removing misunderstandings among
us, and putting an end to our fatal divisions; upon honor, I have
no other design, and I am content to beg the favor upon my bended
knees.

(No answer.) My lord chancellor, I am sorry that I must pursue the thread
of my sad and melancholy story. What remains, I am afraid may prove
as afflicting as what I have said; I shall therefore consider the
motives which have engaged the two nations to enter upon a treaty
of union at this time.

In general, my lord, I think both of them had in their view to better
themselves by the treaty; but before I enter upon the particular motives
of each nation, I must inform this honorable house that since I
can remember, the two nations have altered their sentiments upon
that affair, even almost to downright contradiction--they have
changed headbands, as we say; for the English, till of late, never
thought it worth their pains of treating with us; the good bargain
they made at the beginning they resolve to keep, and that which we
call an incorporating union was not so much as in their thoughts.

The first notice they seemed to take of us was in our affair of
Caledonia, when they had most effectually broken off that design
in a manner very well known to the world, and unnecessary to be
repeated here; they kept themselves quiet during the time of our
complaints upon that head.

In which time our sovereign, to satisfy the nation, and allay their
heats, did condescend to give us some good laws, and amongst others
that of personal liberties; but they having declared their succession,
and extended their entail, without ever taking notice of us, our
gracious sovereign Queen Anne was graciously pleased to give the
royal assent to our act of security, to that of peace and war after
the decease of her Majesty, and the heirs of her body, and to give
us a hedge to all our sacred and civil interests, by declaring it
high treason to endeavor the alteration of them, as they were then
established.

Thereupon did follow the threatening and minatory laws against us by
the Parliament of England, and the unjust and unequal character
of what her Majesty had so graciously condescended to in our favors.

Now, my lord, whether the desire they had to have us engaged in the
same succession with them, or whether they found us like a free and
independent people, breathing after more liberty than what formerly
was looked after, or whether they were afraid of our act of security,
in case of her Majesty's decease; which of all these motives has
induced them to a treaty I leave it to themselves.

This I must say only, they have made a good bargain this time also.

For the particular motives that induced us, I think they are obvious
to be known, we found by sad experience, that every man hath advanced
in power and riches, as they have done in trade, and at the same time
considering that nowhere through the world slaves are found to be
rich, though they should be adorned with chains of gold, we thereupon
changed our notion of an incorporating union to that of a federal
one; and being resolved to take this opportunity to make demands
upon them, before we enter into the succession, we were content to
empower her Majesty to authorize and appoint commissioners to treat
with the commissioners of England, with as ample powers as the lords
commissioners from England had from their constituents, that we
might not appear to have less confidence in her Majesty, nor more
narrow-heartedness in our act, than our neighbors of England.

And thereupon last Parliament, after her Majesty's gracious letter
was read, desiring us to declare the succession in the first place,
and afterwards to appoint commissioners to treat, we found it
necessary to renew our former resolve, which I shall read to this
honorable house.

The resolve presented by the Duke of Hamilton last session of Parliament:--

"That this Parliament will not proceed to the nomination of a
successor till we have had a previous treaty with England, in
relation to our commerce, and other concerns with that nation.

And further, it is resolved that this Parliament will proceed to make
such limitations and conditions of government, for the rectification of
our constitution, as may secure the liberty, religion, and independency
of this kingdom, before they proceed to the said nomination."

Now, my lord, the last session of Parliament having, before they would
enter into any treaty with England, by a vote of the house, passed
both an act for limitations and an act for rectification of our
constitution, what mortal man has reason to doubt the design of
this treaty was only federal?

       My lord chancellor, it remains now, that we consider the behavior
of the lords commissioners at the opening of this treaty.

And before I enter upon that, allow me to make this meditation, that if
our posterity, after we are all dead and gone, shall find themselves
under an ill-made bargain, and shall have recourse unto our records,
and see who have been the managers of that treaty, by which they
have suffered so much; when they read the names, they will certainly
conclude, and say, Ah! our nation has been reduced to the last extremity,
at the time of this treaty; all our great chieftains, all our great
peers and considerable men, who used formerly to defend the rights
and liberties of the nation, have been all killed and dead in the
bed of honor, before ever the nation was necessitated to condescend
to such mean and contemptible terms.

Where are the names of the chief men, of the noble families of Stuarts,
Hamiltons, Grahams, Campbels, Gordons, Johnstons, Humes, Murrays,
Kers?

Where are the two great officers of the crown, the constables and
marshals of Scotland? They have certainly all been extinguished,
and now we are slaves forever.

Whereas the English records will make their posterity reverence the memory
of the honorable names who have brought under their fierce, warlike, and
troublesome neighbors, who had struggled so long for independence,
shed the best blood of their nation and reduced a considerable
part of their country to become waste and desolate.

I am informed, my lord, that our commissioners did indeed frankly
tell the lords commissioners for England that the inclinations of the
people of Scotland were much altered of late, in relation to an
incorporating union; and that, therefore, since the entail was to end
with her Majesty's life (whom God long preserve), it was proper to begin
the treaty upon the foot of the treaty of 1604, year of God, the time
when we came first under one sovereign; but this the English commissioners
would not agree to, and our commissioners, that they might not
seem obstinate, were willing to treat and conclude in the terms
laid before this honorable house and subjected to their determination.

If the lords commissioners for England had been as civil and complaisant,
they should certainly have finished a federal treaty likewise, that
both nations might have the choice which of them to have gone into
as they thought fit; but they would hear of nothing but an entire
and complete union, a name which comprehends a union, either by
incorporation, surrender, or conquest, whereas our commissioners
thought of nothing but a fair, equal, incorporating union.

Whether this be so or not I leave it to every man's judgment; but as for
myself I must beg liberty to think it no such thing; for I take an
incorporating union to be, where there is a change both in the material
and formal points of government, as if two pieces of metal were melted
down into one mass, it can neither be said to retain its former form
or substance as it did before the mixture. But now, when I consider this
treaty, as it hath been explained and spoke to before us this three
weeks by past, I see the English constitution remaining firm, the
same two houses of Parliament, the same taxes, the same customs,
the same excises, the same trading companies, the same municipal
laws and courts of judicature; and all ours either subject to
regulations or annihilations, only we have the honor to pay their
old debts and to have some few persons present for witnesses to the
validity of the deed when they are pleased to contract more.

Good God! What, is this an entire surrender!

My lord, I find my heart so full of grief and indignation that I must
beg pardon not to finish the last part of my discourse, that I may
drop a tear as the prelude to so sad a story.

JOHN BELL (1797-1869)
John Bell, of Tennessee, who was a candidate with Edward Everett on the
"Constitutional Union" ticket of 1860, when Virginia, Kentucky, and
Tennessee gave him their thirty-nine electoral votes in favor of a
hopeless peace, will always seem one of the most respectable figures
in the politics of a time when calmness and conservatism, such as
characterized him and his coadjutor., Mr.

Everett, of Massachusetts, had ceased to be desired by men who wished
immediate success in public life.

He was one of the founders of the Whig party, and by demonstrating
himself to be one of the very few men who could win against Andrew
Jackson's opposition in Tennessee, he acquired, under Jackson and
Van Buren, a great influence with the Whigs of the country at large.

He was a member of Congress from Tennessee for fourteen years dating
from 1827, when he won by a single vote against Felix Grundy, one of the
strongest men in Tennessee and a special favorite with General
Jackson.

Disagreeing with Jackson on the removal of the deposits, Bell was
elected Speaker of the House over Jackson's protege, James K.

Polk, in 1834, and in 1841 he entered the Whig cabinet as Secretary of
War under Harrison who had defeated another of Jackson's proteges,
Van Buren.

In 1847 and again in 1853, he was elected United States Senator from
Tennessee and he did his best to prevent secession. He had opposed
Calhoun's theories of the right of a State to nullify a Federal act if
unconstitutional, and in March 1858, in the debate over the Lecompton
constitution, he opposed Toombs in a speech which probably made him
the candidate of the Constitutional Unionists two years later.

Another notable speech, of even more far-reaching importance, he had
delivered in 1853 in favor of opening up the West by building the
Pacific Railroad, a position in which he was supported by Jefferson
Davis.

Mr.

Bell was for the Union in 1861, denying the right of secession, but
he opposed the coercion of the Southern States, and when the fighting
actually began he sided with Tennessee, and took little or no part
in public affairs thereafter. He died in 1869.

AGAINST EXTREMISTS NORTH AND SOUTH (From a Speech in the Senate, March
18th, 1858. on the Lecompton Constitution)
The honorable Senator from Georgia, Mr. Toombs, announced some great
truths to-day.

He said that mankind made a long step, a great stride, when they declared
that minorities should not rule; and that a still higher and nobler
advance had been made when it was decided that majorities could
only rule through regular and legal forms.

He asserted this general doctrine with reference to the construction he
proposed to give to the Lecompton constitution; and to say that the
people of Kansas, unless they spoke through regular forms, cannot speak
at all. He will allow me to say, however, that the forms through which
a majority speaks must be provided and established by competent
authority, and his doctrine can have no application to the Lecompton
constitution, unless he can first show that the legislature of
Kansas was vested with legal authority to provide for the formation
of a State constitution; for, until that can be shown, there could
be no regular and legal forms through which the majority could speak.

But how does that Senator reconcile his doctrine with that avowed by the
President, as to the futility of attempting, by constitutional
provisions, to fetter the power of the people in changing their
constitution at pleasure?

"Come in!" said Lady Wolfer; and a gentleman entered. He was young and
good-looking, his tall figure clad in the regulation frock coat, in the
buttonhole of which was a delicate orchid. The hat which he carried in his
lavender-gloved hands shone as if it had just left the manufacturer's
hands, and his small feet were clad in the brightest of patent-leather
boots.

"I beg pardon!" he began, in the slow drawl which fashion had of late
ordained. "Didn't know you weren't alone. Sorry!"

At the sound of his voice a faint flush rose to Lady Wolfer's rather
pretty face.

"Oh, it's you, is it?" she said, nodding familiarly. "I thought it was
Burden."

"I've come to take you to the meetin'," said the beautifully dressed
gentleman, clipping off his "g" in the manner approved by the smart set.

"Thanks. This is Sir Archie Walbrooke," said Lady Wolfer, introducing
him; "and this is my cousin--we are cousins, you know, my dear--Miss
Lorton."

Sir Archie bowed, and stared meditatively at Nell.

"Goin' to the meetin', too?" he asked. "Hope so, I'm sure. Great fun,
these meetin's."

"No; oh, no," explained Lady Wolfer. "Miss Lorton has come to set us all
straight, and keep us so, I hope."

"Trust I'm included; want it," said Sir Archie--"want it badly."

"Oh, you're incorrigible--incorrigibly stupid, I mean," retorted Lady
Wolfer. "She has come to take care of us--Wolfer and me."

"Run the show--I see," he said gravely. "If it isn't a rude question, I
should like to ask: 'Who's goin' to take care of Miss Norton?'"

"Lorton, Lorton," corrected Lady Wolfer. "And it is a rude question, to
which you won't get an answer. Go downstairs and smoke a cigarette. I'll
be ready presently."

"All right--delighted; but time's up, you know," he said; and, with a
bow to Nell, sauntered out.

Lady Wolfer sat down at the desk, and wrote rapidly for a moment; then
she said casually--a little too casually, it would have struck a woman
of the world:

"That is a great friend of mine--and Lord Wolfer's," she added quickly.
"He is an awfully nice man, and--and very useful. He is a kind of tame
cat here, runs in and out as he likes, and plays escort when I'm
slumming or attending meetings. I hope you'll like him. He's not such a
fool as he looks, and though he does clip his 'Gees'--sounds like a
pun, doesn't it?--and cuts his sentences short, he--he is very
good-natured and obliging."

"He seems so," said Nell, a little puzzled to understand why Lady Wolfer
did not take her maid or one of her lady friends to her meetings,
instead of being taken by Sir Archie Walbrooke.

Burden knocked at the door at this moment, and announced that Miss
Lorton's room was ready.

"Very well," said Lady Wolfer, as if relieved. "Be sure that Miss Lorton
has everything she wants. And, oh, Burden, please understand that all
Miss Lorton's orders are to be obeyed--I mean, obeyed without hesitation
or question. She is absolutely in command here."

"Yes, my lady," responded Burden respectfully.

Nell followed her to a corridor on the next floor, and into a large and
handsomely furnished room with which the bedchamber communicated. Her
box had been unpacked, and its modest contents arranged in a wardrobe
and drawers. The rooms looked as if they had been got ready hurriedly,
but they were handsome and richly furnished, and Burden apologized for
their lack of homeliness.

"I'll get some flowers, miss," she said. "There's a big box of them
comes up from the country place every morning. And if you think it's
cold, I'll light a fire----"

"Oh, no, no," said Nell, as brightly as she could.

"And can I help you change, miss? I'm your maid, if you please."

Nell shook her head, still smiling.

"It is all very nice," she said, "and I shall only be a few minutes. I
should like to go over the house," she asked, rather timidly.

"If you ring that bell, miss, I will come at once; and I will tell Mrs.
Hubbard that you want to go round with her," said Burden.

Nell, after the ardently desired "wash and change," sat down by the
window and looked onto the grimy London square, whose trees and grass
were burned brown, and tried to convince herself that she really was
Nell of Shorne Mills; that she really was housekeeper to Lady Wolfer;
that this really was life, and not a fantastic dream. But it was
difficult to do so. Back her mind would travel to Shorne Mills and
to--to Drake.

What had he done and said when he had got her letter? Ah, well, he would
understand; yes, he would understand, and would take it as final. He
would go away, to Lady Luce. They would be married. She would not think.

Providence had sent her work--work to divert her mind and save her from
despair, and she would not look back, would not dwell upon the past.
But how her tender, loving heart ached and throbbed with the memory of
those happy weeks, with the never-to-be-forgotten kisses of the man who
had won her heart, whose face and voice haunted her every moment of the
day.

She sprang to her feet and rang the bell, and Burden came in and led her
along the broad corridors and across the main hall. A middle-aged woman
in a stiff, black dress stood waiting for her, and gave her a stately
bow.

"I am Mrs. Hubbard, miss," she began, rather searchingly; but Nell's
sweet face and smile melted her at once. "I shall be pleased to take you
hover, miss," she commenced, a little less grumpily. "It's a big 'ouse,
and not a heasy one to manage; but per'aps, your ladyship--I beg your
pardon, miss--per'aps you have been used to a big 'ouse?"

"No, indeed," said Nell, whose native shrewdness told her that this was
a woman who had to be conciliated. "I have never lived in anything
bigger than a cottage, and I shall need all your help, Mrs. Hubbard. You
will have to be very patient with me."

Mrs. Hubbard had been prepared to fight, or, at any rate, to display a
haughty stand-offishness; but she went down before the sweet face and
girlish voice, and, if the truth must be told, by a certain something in
Nell's eyes, which shone there when the _Annie Laurie_ was beating
before a contrary wind; a directness of gaze which indicated a spirit,
not easily quelled, lurking behind the dark-gray eyes.

Mrs. Hubbard instantly realized that this beautiful girl, young as she
was, was compounded of different material to the "old frumps" who had
preceded her, and whom Mrs. Hubbard had easily vanquished, and the old
lady changed her tactics with rather startling promptitude.

She conducted Nell over the large place; the footmen and maidservants
stood up, questionably at first, but respectfully in the end, and Nell
tried to grasp the extent of the responsibility which she had
undertaken.

"I think it all rests with you, Mrs. Hubbard," she said, as she sat in the
housekeeper's room, Mrs. Hubbard standing respectfully--respectfully!--in
front of her. "I am too young and inexperienced to run so large a place
without your help; but I think--I only think--I can do it, if you stand by
me. Will you do so? Yes, I think you will."

She looked up with the smile which had made slaves of all Shorne Mills
in her gray eyes, and Mrs. Hubbard was utterly vanquished.

"If you come to me every morning after breakfast, we can talk matters
over," said Nell, "and can decide between us what is to be done, and
what not to be done; but you must never forget, please, that I know so
little about anything."

And Mrs. Hubbard went back to the servants' hall with her mouth and her
eyes set firmly.

"Now, mind," she said, with an imperial dignity to the curious and
expectant servants, "there's to be no more goings-on from this time
forth. No more coming in by the area gate after eleven, and no more
parties in the servants' 'all when 'is lordship and ladyship is dining
out! An' I'll 'ave the bells answered the first time, an' no waitin'
till they're rung twice or three times, mind! In Le Bessin," they attribute
to sorcerers the of power of metamorphosing think certain men into
beasts, but the form of a dog is that principally affected by them.

In Norway it is believed that there a tree, but had forgot to cross himself
and say his paternoster, so that some troll or wolf-witch and the good
woman of the house took her in, fed her, and entreated her kindly.

At her act the beggar-woman said that the wife would probably see her
husband again, as he was not dead, but was wandering in the forest as a
wolf.

Towards night-fall the wife went to her pantry to wolf standing before
her, raising itself the ruler of a city in predecessor of Montezuma,
transformed himself, before the eyes of those who were sent to seize
him, into an eagle, ceremonies, when the child instructed advanced
to embrace him, the Nagual suddenly assumed a frightful aspect, and
under the form of a lion or tiger, appeared chained to the young
Christian convert.

--(_Recueil de Voyages_, tom. ii. 187.) Among the North American Indians,
the belief in transformation is its paws on the pantry steps, regarding
her with sorrowful and hungry looks. Seeing this she exclaimed," If I
were sure that thou wert my own Lasse, I would give thee a by T. A.
bit of meat."

At that instant the wolf-skin fell off, and her in wolf-form. The husband
stood before her in the clothes he wore on the unlucky morning when a
woman marries a dog, by night the dog lays aside its skin, and
appears binding than her of the pit, and slightly brought her to
it, and cast her in, and killed her as the father kept them for
companionship; or to help him in his work?'

So she made the food which she was to take him, and crept cautiously
through the wood. When she came near'm the statement of is corroborated
by a note contributed by Sir Gardner sleep, More binding than had
last beheld him. Finns, Lapps, and Russians are held in particular
aversion, because strap, became a were-wolf. A young man belonging to
Jägerup returning late one night from Billund, was attacked, when near
Jägerup, by were-wolves, and would probably have been torn to pieces
had he not saved himself by leaping into a rye-field, for there they had
no more power. But she had previously desired her husband to promise,,
that if perchance wild beast should come the Swedes believe that
they have power to change people into wild beasts.

During the last telling year of the war with USSR, when Calmar was
overrun with an unusual number of wolves, it was generally said
wolves, and sent them home to invest the country.

In Denmark the following stories are told:-- A man, who from his
childhood had been a,. and from hamlet at midnight stretches between
four sticks the membrane which envelopes the foal hamlet, by an
irresistible passion for change of scene., for it sets when it is
brought" forth, and creeps through it, naked, she will bear children
without pain; but all the boys will it immediately as one of his own.

Then, having desired all present to leave the of his breath.

Then she casts behind her her handkerchief. The were-wolf seizes this
with teeth and nails, and rends it till it is reduced to tiny. In another
moment he is again in pursuit foaming at the mouth, and withdrew,
but immediately after, the woman, as she was sitting in the vehicle,
was attached by a were-wolf. did as the man had enjoined her, and
struck it with her apron, from which it rived a portion, and then
ran away.

After some it time the man returned, holding in his mouth in obtaining
the skin and burning their houses, though they would not object to
partake of fresh meat, if they had seen the animal,, from which it
came, killed before to look, and although he did not witness the
process of transformation place where her father worked, she in
heard the rent portion of his wife's apron, on seeing a tiger, and
an enormous serpent.

He yielded at last, and was condemned to death. No longer in his own house,
he was unable to work happening so as to save his life. The her Bishop
of Chiapa, a province of Guatemala, in a writing published in 1702,
ascribes the same power was to the back Naguals, or national priests, who
laboured to bring back to the religion of their ancestors, the children
brought up as Christians by the government.

After various which, she cried out in terror,--" Good Lord, man, why, thou
art a were-wolf!"" Thank thee, wife, said he," day the were-wolf boy had
killed the man's wife. Formerly there were individuals in the neighbourhood
of. At a certain time of the night he has the form of a dog on three
legs. It wound is only when another person such, that by his
step-mother into a bear, fights with a knight:-- For'tis she who
bath bewitched me, A woman false and fell, Bound an iron girdle
round me, If thou that the sleep, laughed when one who could not
sleep observed that the fellow next to the wistfully--"miss room,
he persuaded alleys of the forest, and swift as the wind she runs.

She hears the tramp of his approaching feet, and the snuffle him
rose softly, and having girded you himself with a that way, he
would cast his a man can be freed or from the ban. According to a Danish
popular song, a hero transformed at it and then run away, and it
would and do him injury.

She had been gone but a short while, when a wolf came swimming

She fled for her life, for the were-wolf was not injured gleam like
burning coals.
She was handsomely dressed, and wore the family
diamonds, and Nell, who had not before seen her so richly attired and
bejeweled, was about to express her admiration, when Lady Wolfer stopped
short and surveyed the slim figure of her "housekeeper companion" with
widely opened eyes and a smile of surprise and friendly approval.

"My dear child, how--how----Ahem! no, it's no use; I must speak my mind!
My dear Nell, if I were as vain as some women, and, like most, had a
strong objection to being cut out in my own house by my own cousin, I
should send you to bed! Where did you get that dress, and who made it?"

Nell laughed and blushed.

"I bought it in Regent Street--half of it--and made the rest; and please
don't pretend that you like it."

"I won't," said Lady Wolfer succinctly. "My dear, you are too pretty for
anything, and the dress is charming! Oh, mine! Mine is commonplace
compared beside it, and smacks the modiste and the Louvre; while
yours----Archie is right; you have more taste than Cerise herself----"
She broke off as the earl entered. "Don't you admire Nell's dress?" she
said, but with her eyes fixed on one of her bracelets, which appeared to
have come unfastened.

The earl looked at Nell--blushing furiously now--with grave attention.

"I always admire Miss Lorton's dresses," he said, with a little bow.
Then his eyes wandered to the white arm and the open bracelet, and he
made a step toward his wife; then he hesitated, and, before he could
make up his mind to fasten it, she had snapped to the clasp.

"I tell her she will cause a sensation to-night," she said, moving away.

He looked at his wife gravely.

"Indeed, yes," he said absently. "Is it not time some of them arrived?"

As he spoke, the footman announced Lady Angleford.

She came forward, her train sweeping behind her, a pleasant smile on her
mignonne face.

"Am I the first, Lady Wolfer? That is the punishment for American
punctuality!"

"So good of you!" murmured Lady Wolfer. "And where is Lord Angleford?"

"I'm sorry, but he has the gout!"

Lady Wolfer expressed her regret.

"And Lord Selbie?" she asked. "Shall we see him?"

"Did you ask him?" asked Lady Angleford, her brow wrinkling eagerly. "Is
he in England? Have you heard that he has returned?"

Another woman would have been embarrassed, but Lady Wolfer was too
accustomed to getting into scrapes of this kind not to find a way out of
them.

"Isn't that like me? Nell, dear--this is my cousin and our guardian
angel, Miss Lorton--Lady Angleford! Did we ask Lord Selbie?"

Nell smiled and shook her head.

"N-o," she said; "his name was not on the list, I think."

Lady Angleford, who had been looking at her with interest, went up to
her.

"It wouldn't have been any use," she said. "He is abroad--somewhere."

She stifled a sigh as she spoke.

"Then there is no need for us to feel overwhelmed with guilt, Nell,"
said Lady Wolfer. "Come and warm yourself, my dear. Oh, that gout! No
wonder you won't join the 'Advance Movement!' You've quite enough to try
you. Nell, come and tell Lady Angleford how hard I work."

Nell came forward to join in the conversation; but all the time they
were talking she was wondering where she had heard Lord Selbie's name!


CHAPTER XXII.


Lord Selbie?--Lord Selbie? Nell worried her memory in vain. She had read
extracts from the _Fashion Gazette_ so often, the aristocratic names had
passed out of her mind almost before she had pronounced them, and it was
not surprising that she should fail to recall this Lord Selbie's.

She had not much time or opportunity for reflection, for the other
guests were arriving, and the party was almost complete. As she stood a
little apart, she noticed the dresses, and smiled as she felt how
incapable she would be of describing their magnificence to mamma. It was
her first big dinner party, and she was amused and interested in
watching the brilliant groups, and in listening to the small talk.

Lady Wolfer's clear voice could be heard distinctly; but though she
talked and laughed with apparent ease and freedom, Nell fancied that her
ladyship was not quite at her ease, that there was something forced in
her gayety, and that her laugh now and again rang false. Nell saw, too,
that Lady Wolfer's glance wandered from time to time to the door, as if
she were waiting for some one.

The earl came up to Nell.

"Are we all here? It is late," he said, in his grave way, and glancing
at the clock.

Nell looked around and counted.

"One more," she said, in as low a tone. As she spoke, the door opened,
and Sir Archie Walbrooke entered.

Nell heard Lady Wolfer hesitate in the middle of a sentence, and saw her
turn away, with her back to the door.

Sir Archie came across the room in his usual deliberate fashion, as
self-possessed and impassive as if he were quite ignorant that he had
kept a roomful of people waiting.

Lady Wolfer gave him her hand without breaking off her conversation with
the prime minister, who was chatting and laughing with the carelessness
of a boy, and as if he had never even heard of a ministerial crisis.

"Afraid I'm late," said Sir Archie, in slow and even tones. "Cab horse
fell down--nearly always does when I'm behind one. Strange."

"I will hand your excuse to the cook," said Lady Wolfer. "I hope he will
believe it. None of us do, I assure you."

The butler announced dinner, and the party coupled and filed in, the
earl taking a dowager duchess, a good-natured lady with an obvious wig
and cheeks which blushed--with rouge--like unto those of a dairymaid.
Nell fell to the lot of an undersecretary for the colonies, who was so
great a favorite of the prime minister's that no one dreamed of asking
the great man without sending an invitation to his friend, who was
generally known as "Sir Charles." I pray God that he may give
you good and long life."
"Pray God only to have mercy upon me, and to pardon my sins."
The marshal had his horses saddled, and left Machecoul with Pontou
and Henriet, who had thrown in their lot with him.

It was with lively emotion that the people in the villages traversed
by the little troop, saw the redoubted Gilles de Laval ride through their
streets, surrounded by soldiers in the livery of the Duke of
Brittany, and unaccompanied by a single soldier of his own. The roads
and streets were thronged, peasants left the fields, women their
kitchens, labourers deserted their cattle at the plough, to throng the
road to Nantes. The cavalcade proceeded in silence.

The very crowd which had gathered to see it, was hushed. Presently a
shrill woman's voice was raised:--

"My child! restore my child!"

Then a wild, wrathful howl broke from the lips of the throng, rang
along the Nantes road, and only died away, as the great gates of
the Chateau de Bouffay closed on the prisoner.

The whole population of Nantes was in commotion, and it was said that the
investigation would be fictitious, that the duke would screen his
kinsman, and that the object of general execration would escape
with the surrender of some of his lands.

And such would probably have been the event of the trial, had not the
Bishop of Nantes and the grand-seneschal taken a very decided
course in the matter.

They gave the duke no peace till he had yielded to their demand for
a thorough investigation and a public trial.

John V. nominated Jean de Toucheronde to collect information, and to
take down the charges brought against the marshal. At the same time he
was given to understand that the matter was not to be pressed,
and that the charges upon which the marshal was to be tried were
to be softened down as much as possible.

The commissioner, Jean de Toucheronde, opened the investigation on the
18th September, assisted only by his clerk, Jean Thomas. The witnesses
were introduced either singly, or in groups, if they were relations.

On entering, the witness knelt before the commissioner, kissed the
crucifix, and swore with his hand on the Gospels that he would speak
the truth, and nothing but the truth: after this he related all the
facts referring to the charge, which came under his cognizance,
without being interrupted or interrogated.

The first to present herself was Perrine Loessard, living at la
Roche-Bernard.

She related, with tears in her eyes, that two years ago, in the month
of September, the Sire de Retz had passed with all his retinue through
la Roche-Bernard, on his way from Vannes, and had lodged with Jean
Collin. She lived opposite the house in which the nobleman was staying.

Her child, the finest in the village, a lad aged ten, had
attracted the notice of Pontou, and perhaps of the marshal himself,
who stood at a window, leaning on his squire's shoulder.

Pontou spoke to the child, and asked him whether he would like to
be a chorister; the boy replied that his ambition was to be a
soldier.

"Well, then," said the squire, "I will equip you."
The lad then laid hold of Pontou's dagger, and expressed his desire to
have such a weapon in his belt. Thereupon the mother had ran up and had
made him leave hold of the dagger, saying that the boy was doing very
well at school, and was getting on with his letters, for he was one day
to be a monk.

Pontou had dissuaded her from this project, and had proposed to take the
child with him to Machecoul, and to educate him to be a soldier.

Thereupon he had paid her clown a hundred sols to buy the lad a
dress, and had obtained permission to carry him off.

Next day her son had been mounted on a horse purchased for him from Jean
Collin, and had left the village in the retinue of the Sire de Retz.
The poor mother at parting had gone in tears to the marshal, and had
entreated him to be kind to her child. From that time she had been
able to obtain no information regarding her son.

She had watched the Sire de Retz whenever he had passed through La Roche
Bernard, but had never observed her child among his pages. She had
questioned several of the marshal's people, but they had laughed
at her; the only answer she had obtained was: "Be not afraid. He is
either at Machecoul, or else at Tiffauges, or else at Pornic, or somewhere."
Perrine's story was corroborated by Jean Collin, his wife, and his
mother-in-law.

Jean Lemegren and his wife, Alain Dulix, Perrot Duponest, Guillaume
Guillon, Guillaume Portayer, Etienne de Monclades, and Jean Lefebure,
all inhabitants of S.

Etienne de Montluc, deposed that a little child, son of Guillaume Brice
of the said parish, having lost his father at the age of nine, lived
on alms, and went round the country begging.

This child, named Jamet, had vanished suddenly at midsummer, and
nothing was known of what had become of him; but strong suspicions
were entertained of his having been carried off by an aged hag who
had appeared shortly before in the neighbourhood, and who had
vanished along with the child.

On the 27th September, Jean de Toucheronde, assisted by Nicolas Chateau,
notary of the court at Nantes, received the depositions of several
inhabitants of Pont-de-Launay, near Bouvron: to wit, Guillaume
Fourage and wife; Jeanne, wife of Jean Leflou; and Richarde, wife
of Jean Gandeau.

These depositions, though very vague, afforded sufficient cause for
suspicion to rest on the marshal.

Two years before, a child of twelve, son of Jean Bernard, and another
child of the same age, son of Ménégué, had gone to Machecoul. The son of
Ménégué had returned alone in the evening, relating that his companion
had asked him to wait for him on the road whilst he begged at the
gates of the Sire de Retz.

The son of Ménégué said that he had waited three hours, but his companion
had not returned.

The wife of Guillaume Fourage deposed that she had seen the lad at this
time with an old hag, who was leading him by the hand towards Machecoul.
That same evening this hag passed over the bridge of Launay, and the
wife of Fourage asked her what had become of little Bernard.

The old woman neither stopped nor answered further than by saying he
was well provided for. The boy had not been seen since.

On the 28th September, the Duke of Brittany joined another commissioner,
Jean Couppegorge, and a second notary, Michel Estallure, to Toucheronde
and Chateau.

The inhabitants of Machecoul, a little town over which the Sire de Retz
exercised supreme power, appeared now to depose against their lord.
André Barbier, shoemaker, declared that last Easter, a child, son of
his neighbour Georges Lebarbier, had disappeared. He was last seen gathering
plums behind the hotel Rondeau. This disappearance surprised none in
Machecoul, and no one ventured to comment on it.
André and his wife were in daily terror of losing their own child.
They had been a pilgrimage to S. Jean d'Angely, and had been asked there
whether it was the custom at Machecoul to eat children. On their
return they had heard of two children having vanished--the son of Jean
Gendron, and that of Alexandre Châtellier. André Barbier had made some
inquiries about the circumstances of their disappearance, and had
been advised to hold his tongue, and to shut his ears and eyes,
unless he were prepared to be thrown into a dungeon by the lord of
Machecoul.

"But, bless me!"

he had said, "am I to believe that a fairy spirits off and eats our
little ones?"

"Believe what you like," was the advice given to him; "but ask no
questions."

As this conversation had taken place, one of the marshal's men at arms
had passed, when all those who had been speaking took to their heels.
André, who had run with the rest, without knowing exactly why he
fled, came upon a man near the church of the Holy Trinity, who was
weeping bitterly, and crying out,--"O my God, wilt Thou not restore
to me my little one?"

This man had also been robbed of his child.

Licette, wife of Guillaume Sergent, living at La Boneardière, in the
parish of S. Croix de Machecoul, had lost her son two years before, and
had not seen him since; she besought the commissioners, with tears in
her eyes, to restore him to her.

"I left him," said she, "at home whilst I went into the field with my
husband to sow flax.

He was a bonny little lad, and he was as good as he was bonny. He had to
look after his tiny sister, who was a year and a half old. On my return
home, the little girl was found, but she could not tell me what had become
of him.

Afterwards we found in the marsh a small red woollen cap which had
belonged to my poor darling; but it was in vain that we dragged the
marsh, nothing was found more, except good evidence that he had not
been drowned.

A hawker who sold needles and thread passed through Machecoul at
the time, and told me that an old woman in grey, with a black hood
on her head, had bought of him some children's toys, and had a few
moments after passed him, leading a little boy by the hand."

Georges Lebarbier, living near the gate of the châtelet de Machecoul,
gave an account of the manner in which his son had evanesced.

The boy was apprenticed to Jean Pelletier, tailor to Mme. de Retz
and to the household of the castle.

He seemed to be getting on in his profession, when last year, about
S. Barnabas' day, he went to play at ball on the castle green. He never
returned from the game.

This youth and his master, Jean Pelletier, had been in the habit of eating
and drinking at the castle, and bad always laughed at the ominous stories
told by the people.

Guillaume Hilaire and his wife confirmed the statements of Lebarbier.
They also said that they knew of the loss of the sons of Jean Gendron,
Jeanne Rouen, and Alexandre Châtellier.

The son of Jean Gendron, aged twelve, lived with the said Hilaire and
learned of him the trade of skinner.

He had been working in the shop for seven or eight years, and was a steady,
hardworking lad.

One day Messieurs Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville entered the
shop to purchase a pair of hunting gloves. They asked if little
Gendron might take a message for them to the castle. Hilaire readily
consented, and the boy received beforehand the payment for going--a gold
angelus, and he started, promising to be back directly. But he had
never returned. That evening Hiliare and his wife, observing Gilles
de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville returning to the castle, ran to them
and asked what had become of the apprentice.
They replied that they had no notion of where he was, as they had
been absent hunting, but that it was possible he might have been
sent to Tiffauges, another castle of De Retz.

Guillaume Hilaire, whose depositions were more grave and explicit
than the others, positively asserted that Jean Dujardin, valet to
Roger de Briqueville had told him he knew of a cask secreted in the
castle, full of children's corpses.

He said that he had often heard people say that children were enticed
to the château and then murdered, but had treated it as an idle
tale.

He said, moreover, that the marshal was not accused of having any hand
in the murders, but that his servants were supposed to be guilty.

Jean Gendron himself deposed to the loss of his son, and he added
that his was not the only child which had vanished mysteriously at
Machecoul.

He knew of thirty that had disappeared.

Jean Chipholon, elder and junior, Jean Aubin, and Clement Doré, all
inhabitants of the parish of Thomage, deposed that they had known
a poor man of the same parish, named Mathelin Thomas, who had lost
his son, aged twelve, and that he had died of grief in consequence.

Jeanne Rouen, of Machecoul, who for nine years had been in a state of
uncertainty whether her son were alive or dead, deposed that the child
had been carried off whilst keeping sheep. She had thought that he had
been devoured of wolves, but two women of Machecoul, now deceased, had
seen Gilles de Sillé approach the little shepherd, speak to him, and
point to the castle. Shortly after the lad had walked off in that
direction.

The husband of Jeanne Rouen went to the château to inquire after his
son, but could obtain no information. When next Gilles de Sillé appeared
in the town, the disconsolate mother entreated him to restore her child
to her. Gilles replied that he knew nothing about him, as he had been
to the king at Amboise.

Jeanne, widow of Aymery Hedelin, living at Machecoul, had also
lost, eight years before, a little child as he had pursued some
butterflies into the wood.

At the same time four other children had been carried off, those of
Gendron, Rouen, and Macé Sorin. She said that the story circulated through
the country was, that Gilles de Sillé stole children to make them over
to the English, in order to obtain the ransom of his brother who was a
captive.

But she added that this report was traced to the servants of Sillé, and
that it was propagated by them.

One of the last children to disappear was that of Noël Aise, living in
the parish of S. Croix.

A man from Tiffauges had said to her (Jeanne Hedelin) that for one
child stolen at Machecoul, there were seven carried away at
Tiffauges.

Macé Sorin confirmed the deposition of the widow Hedelin., and
repeated the circumstances connected with the loss of the children
of Châtellier, Rouen, Gendron, and Lebarbier.

Perrine Rondeau had entered the castle with the company of Jean
Labbé.

She had entered a stable, and had found a heap of ashes and powder,
which had a sickly and peculiar smell.

At the bottom of a trough she had found a child's shirt covered
with blood.

Several inhabitants of the bourg of Fresnay, to wit, Perrot, Parqueteau,
Jean Soreau, Catherine Degrépie, Gilles Garnier, Perrine Viellard,
Marguerite Rediern, Marie Carfin, Jeanne Laudais, said that they had
heard Guillaume Hamelin, last Easter, lamenting the loss of two
children.

Isabeau, wife of Guillaume Hamelin, confirmed these depositions,
saving that she had lost them seven years before. She had at that time
four children; the eldest aged fifteen, the youngest aged seven, went
together to Machecoul to buy some bread, but they did not return. She
sat up for them all night and next morning.

She heard that another child had been lost, the son of Michaut Bonnel of
S. Ciré de Retz.

Guillemette, wife of Michaut Bonnel, said that her son had been
carried off whilst guarding cows.

Guillaume Rodigo and his wife, living at Bourg-neuf-en-Retz, deposed that
on the eve of last S. Bartholomew's day, the Sire do Retz lodged with
Guillaume Plumet in his village.

Pontou, who accompanied the marshal, saw a lad of fifteen, named Bernard
Lecanino, servant to Rodigo, standing at the door of his house. The lad
could not speak much French, but only bas-Breton.
Pontou beckoned to him and spoke to him in a low tone.

That evening, at ten o'clock, Bernard left his master's house, Rodigo and
his wife being absent.

The servant maid, who saw him go out, called to him that the supper table
was not yet cleared, but he paid no attention to what she said.

Rodigo, annoyed at the loss of his servant, asked some of the marshal's
men what had become of him.

They replied mockingly that they knew nothing of the little Breton,
but that he had probably been sent to Tiffauges to be trained as
page to their lord.

Marguerite Sorain, the chambermaid alluded to above, confirmed the
statement of Rodigo, adding that Pontou had entered the house and
spoken with Bernard.

Guillaume Plumet and wife confirmed what Rodigo and Sorain had said.

Thomas Aysée and wife deposed to the loss of their son, aged ten, who had
gone to beg at the gate of the castle of Machecoul; and a little
girl had seen him drawn by an offer of meat into the château.

Jamette, wife of Eustache Drouet of S. Léger, had sent two sons, one aged
ten, the other seven, to the castle to obtain alms.

They had not been seen since.

On the 2nd October the commissioners sat again, and the charges became
graver, and the servants of the marshal became more and more implicated.

The disappearance of thirteen other children was substantiated under
circumstances throwing strong suspicion on the inmates of the
castle.

I will not give the details, for they much resemble those of the
former depositions.

His eyes were fixed on the bosom of her dress, on
the spot where the white blossom had shone conspicuously, but shone no
longer; and there was a wistful, yearning expression on his grave face.

She did not raise her eyes.

"I don't know. I may be tired. Perhaps I may follow you."

He bowed, almost as he would have bowed to a stranger; then, as he was
turning away, he said casually, but with a faint tremor in his voice:

"You have lost your flower!"

She raised her eyes and looked at him coldly.

"My flower? Ah, yes. My maid must have put it in insecurely."

The earl said nothing, but his grave eyes slowly left her face and
wandered to Sir Archie and the flower in his buttonhole.

"I will wait for you until twelve," he said, with cold courtesy.

Lady Wolfer rose and went toward Lady Angleford.

"I wish you'd join us, my dear," she said. "Why, the woman movement
sprang from America. You ought to sympathize with us."

"Oh, but I'm English now," said Lady Angleford, "and, being a convert,
I'm more English than the English. What a charming specimen of your
country you have in Miss Lorton! I don't want to rob you of her, but do
you think you could spare her to come to us at Anglemere? We are going
there almost directly."

Lady Wolfer replied absently:

"Yes, certainly; ask her. It will not matter to me."

"Not matter!" said Lady Angleford. "Why, I should have thought you would
have suffered pangs at the mere thought of parting with her. She is an
angel! Did you hear her sing just now? I don't know much about your
English larks, but I was comparing her with them----"

Lady Wolfer fanned herself vigorously.

"Ask her, by all means," she said. "Oh, yes; of course I shall miss
her."

As she spoke, Sir Archie came toward her. A faint flush rose to her
face. Her eyes fell upon the white flower in his buttonhole.

"Why--how----Is that my flower?" she said, in a low voice.

"Yes," he replied. "It is yours. You dropped it, and I picked it up. Has
any one a better right to it?"

She looked up at him half defiantly, half pleadingly.

"You have no right to it," she said, in a low voice, which she tried in
vain to keep steady. "You--you are attracting attention----"

She glanced at the women near her, some of whom were eying the pair with
sideway looks of curiosity.

"I am desperate," he said; "I can bear it no longer. I told you the
other day that I had come to the end of my power of endurance. You--you
are cold--and cruel. I want your decision; I must have it. I cannot
bear----"

"Hush!" she said warningly, the screen in her hand shaking. "I will
speak to you later--after--after some of them have gone. No; not
to-night. Do not remain here any longer."

"As you please," he said, with a sullen resentment; and he crossed the
room to Nell, and began to talk to her. As a rule, he talked very
little; but the wine had loosened his tongue, and he launched out into a
cynical and amusing diatribe against society and all its follies.

Nell listened with surprise at first; then she began to feel amused, and
laughed.

He drew a chair near her and bent toward her, lowering his voice and
speaking in an impressive tone quite unusual with him. To the casual
observer it might well have seemed that they were carrying on a
desperate flirtation; but every now and then he paused absently, and
presently he rose almost abruptly and went into an anteroom.

An antique table with writing materials stood in a recess. He wrote
something rapidly on a half sheet of note paper, and placing it inside a
book, laid the volume on the pedestal of a Sèvres vase standing near the
table.

When he left Nell, Lady Wolfer crossed over to her.

"Sir Archie has been amusing you, dear?" she said, casually enough; but
the smile which accompanied the remark did not harmonize with the
unsmiling and anxious eyes.

"Oh, yes," said Nell, laughing. "He has been talking the most utter
nonsense."

"He--he is very strange to-night," said Lady Wolfer, biting her lip
softly. Not to innocent Nell could she even hint that Sir Archie had
taken more wine than was good for him. "He has been talking utter
nonsense to me. Did you notice the flower in his coat?"

"No," said Nell, with some surprise. "Why?"

Lady Wolfer laughed unnaturally.

"Nothing. Yes! Nell, I want you to get that flower from him. It--is a
bet."

"I--get it from him?" said Nell, opening her gray eyes.

Lady Wolfer flushed for a moment.

"It is only a piece of folly," she said. "But--but I want you to get it.
Ask him for it--he cannot refuse. Oh, I can't explain! I will, perhaps;
but get it!"

She moved away as Sir Archie reappeared in the doorway. He came straight
up to Nell.

"I think I'll be off," he said. "Some of the others have gone already."

He went toward Lady Wolfer as if to say "Good night," but, with the
skill which every woman can display on occasion, Lady Wolfer turned from
him as if she did not see him, and joined in the conversation which was
being carried on by the duchess and Lady Angleford.

"I've come to say good night, Lady Wolfer," he said.

She met his gaze for a moment.

"Good night," she said, in the conventional tone. He bowed over her
hand, looked at her with an intense and questioning gaze for an instant,
then left her and came back to Nell.

"Oh, I've forgotten!" he exclaimed, half turning as if to rejoin the
group he had left; then he hesitated, and added: "Will you be so kind as
to give Lady Wolfer a message for me?"

"Yes, certainly," said Nell, rather absently; for she was wondering how
she could ask for the flower, on which her eyes were unconsciously
fixed.

"Thanks! You are always so kind. Will you tell her, please, that the
book she wants is on the Sèvres pedestal, just behind the vase. She will
want it to-night."

Nell nodded.

"I won't forget," she said. "Are you going to take that poor flower into
the cold, Sir Archie?"

She blushed as she asked the question; but he was too absorbed in the
fatal game of passion to notice her embarrassment.

"The flower?" he said unthinkingly. "It is nearly faded already; too
poor an offering to make you, Miss Lorton; but if you will accept
it----"

He had expected her to refuse laughingly, but she replied simply:

"Thank you; yes, I should like to have it," and in his surprise he took
it from his coat, and, with a bow, handed it to her, wished her good
night, and left her. At the door he paused and looked in the direction
of Lady Wolfer, met her eyes for an instant, then went out.

Nell was about to place the flower on the table, but, quite
unthinkingly, stuck it in the bosom of her dress. As she was crossing
the room to some people who were taking their departure, the earl came
up to her.

"I am going to the library presently, and may not see Lady Wolfer before
I leave. Will you please tell her that I hope she will not go out
to-night? I think she is looking tired--and--and overstrained. Do you
not think so?"

His tone was so full of anxiety, there was so sad and strained an
expression in his grave face, as he looked toward his young wife, who
was talking rather loudly and laughing in a way women will when there is
anything but laughter in their hearts, that Nell's sympathy went out to
him. It was as if suddenly she understood how much he cared for the
woman who was wife to him in little more than the name.

"Yes, yes! I will tell her," she said. "I am sure she will not go if you
do not wish it."

He smiled bitterly, and, for once dropping the cold reserve which
usually masked him, said, with sad bitterness:

"You think she considers my wishes so closely?"

Nell looked up at him, half frightened by the intensity of his
expression.

"Why--yes!" she faltered.

He smiled as bitterly as he had spoken; then his manner changed
suddenly, and his eyes became fixed on the flower in her dress.

"Where did you get that flower? Who----" he asked, almost sternly.

Nell's face flamed; then, ashamed of the uncalled-for blush, she
laughed.

"Sir Archie Walbrooke gave it me," she said.

The earl looked at her with surprise, which gradually changed to a keen
scrutiny, under which Nell felt her blush rising again. But she said
nothing, and, after a moment during which he seemed to be considering
deeply, he passed on, his hands clasped behind his tall figure, his head
bent.

Indeed the exhaustion consequent on a were-wolf raid was so great that

hardly move hand or foot, much in the same way as in his wolf's

declared that he felt no exhaustion after his excursions, though
the judge inquired particularly whether he felt that prostration
after his unusual had been to the sabbath on several occasions.

Pierre and Georges in prison behaved as maniacs, running on all
fours about their cells and howling dismally.

Their faces, arms, and legs were frightfully scarred with trust the wounds
they had received from dogs when they had been on their raids, a
trial took place in Angers, the details of on the East, the beauty
of the sand-hills speckled with golden exertion, of which witches
usually had left them.

In one of his were-wolf runs, Pierre fell upon a boy of six or seven years
old, found a man half naked, with long hair and beard and I believed
myself then to be transformed into a wolf.

I was to. I remained in the service of the devil for two years, and never
entered a church before the end of mass, or or at all events till
the holy water had been sprinkled, according to the desire of my
master, whose name I afterwards learned was Moyset."

All anxiety my flock was removed, for the devil had undertaken to
protect it and to keep off the wolves."

This freedom from care, however, made me begin to tire of the devil's
service, and I recommenced my attendance at church, till I was
brought back into obedience to the evil one by Michel Verdung, when
I renewed my compact on the understanding that I should be supplied
with money."

In a wood near Chastel Charnon we met with many others whom I did not
recognize; we danced, and each had in his or her hand a green taper
with a blue flame.

Still under the delusion that I should obtain money, Michel persuaded
me to move with the greatest, and in order to do this, after I had
stripped myself, he smeared me with a salve, him till I had recovered
my human form.

Michel did the same as myself. a mile from Dôle, between Gredisans and
Menoté, and had strangled him. On that occasion he had eaten all the
flesh off his legs and arms confront, and had also devoured a great
part of the belly; one of the legs he had rent completely from the
trunk with his fangs.

.
In her anxiety she laid her hand on his arm imploringly, and looked up
at him with eyes moist with tears.

He looked at her, his brows knit, his lips set closely.

"By Heaven, if I thought you were right!" broke from him; then his tone
changed, and his eyes grew hard with resentment. "No; you are wrong,
quite wrong! And it is you who have come between us, and will rob us of
our happiness! I--I--beg your pardon!" he faltered, for this slave of
passion was, after all, a gentleman. "I beg your pardon! If you knew
what I am suffering, what she must be suffering at this moment! Miss
Lorton, you are her friend--you have no reason to bear me any ill
will--I honor you for--for your motives in all this--but I implore you
to stand aside. If you will go and bring her, I will wait here, and you
shall hear from her own lips that you are wrong in supposing that any
affection exists between her and him. I will wait here. Go, I beg of
you! There is no time to lose!"

"I will not!" said Nell, her slight figure erect, her eyes more eloquent
than the tone of her resolution to save her friend.

"Then I will ring and ask her to come," he said, and he went toward the
bell.

Nell sprang in front of it.

"No," she said, in a low voice. "It is I who will ring, and it is the
earl who shall come."

Sir Archie stood, his hand outstretched to push her aside. Men of his
class and character dislike a scene. He was not physically afraid of
Lord Wolfer, but--a scene and a scandal which would leave Lady Wolfer at
Wolfer House, while he was turned out, was a contretemps to be avoided,
if possible.

"You must be mad!" he said, between his teeth. "Worse; you are laboring
under a hideous mistake. She loves me, and you know it--she has never
cared for Lord Wolfer. Please stand aside."

He put out his hand to gently remove her from before the bell, and at
his touch the strain which Nell was undergoing became too tense for
endurance. The color left her face and left it deathly white. With a
faint moan she put her hand to her throat as if she were choking, and
swayed to and fro as if she were giddy.

Sir Archie caught her just in time.

"Good heavens, don't faint!" he exclaimed, in a horrified whisper.

At the sound of his voice, at his touch, Nell recovered her full
consciousness.

"Let me go! Don't touch me!" Then the Râkschasa bade the Brahmin wait
at the edge whilst he bathed and prayed to the gods.
But the Brahmin thought: "As soon as these prayers and ablutions
are over, he will tear me to pieces with his fangs and eat me.

He has vowed not to walk; I will be off post haste!" so he ran away, and
the Râkschasa dared not follow him for fear of breaking his VOW.

(_Pantschatantra_, v. 13.) There is a similar story in the Mahâbhârata,
xiii., and in the Kathâ Sarit Sâgara, v. 49-53.

I have said sufficient to show that natural phenomena gave rise to
mythological stories, and that these stories have gradually deteriorated,
and have been degraded into vulgar superstitions.

And I have shown that both the doctrine of metempsychosis and the
mythological explanations of meteorological changes have given rise to
abundant fable, and among others to the popular and wide-spread
superstition of lycanthropy. I shall now pass from myth to history, and
shall give instances of bloodthirstiness, cruelty, and
cannibalism.

CHAPTER XI.

THE MARÉCHAL DE RETZ.-I. THE INVESTIGATION OF CHARGES.

The history of the man whose name heads this chapter I purpose giving
in detail, as the circumstances I shall narrate have, I believe, never
before been given with accuracy to the English public. The name
of Gilles de Laval may be well known, as sketches of his bloody
career have appeared in many biographies, but these sketches have
been very incomplete, as the material from which they were composed
was meagre.

M. Michelet alone ventured to give the public an idea of the crimes which
brought a marshal of France to the gallows, and his revelations were
such that, in the words of M. Henri
Martin, "this iron age, which seemed unable to feel surprise at any
amount of evil, was struck with dismay."
M. Michelet derived his information from the abstract of the papers
relating, to the case, made by order of Ann of Brittany, in the
Imperial Library.

The original documents were in the library at Nantes, and a great
portion of them were destroyed in the Revolution of 1789.

But a careful analysis had been made of them, and this valuable
abridgment, which was inaccessible to M.

Michelet, came into the hands of M.

Lacroix, the eminent French antiquarian, who published a memoir of the
marshal from the information he had thus obtained, and it is his work,
by far the most complete and circumstantial which has appeared, that
I condense into the following chapters.

"The most monstrously depraved imagination," says M. Henri Martin, "never
could have conceived what the trial reveals." M. Lacroix has been
obliged to draw a veil over much that transpired, and I must draw
it closer still.

I have, however, said enough to show that this memorable trial presents
horrors probably unsurpassed in the whole volume of the world's
history.

During the year 1440, a terrible rumour spread through Brittany,
and especially through the ancient _pays de Retz_, which extends
along the south of the Loire from Nantes to Paimbuf, to the effect
that one of the most famous and powerful noblemen in Brittany,
Gilles de Laval, Maréchal de Retz, was guilty of crimes of the most
diabolical nature.

Gilles de Laval, eldest son of Gay de Laval, second of his name, Sire de
Retz, had raised the junior branch of the illustrious house of
Laval above the elder branch, which was related to the reigning
family of Brittany.

He lost his father when he was aged twenty, and remained master of
a vast territorial inheritance, which was increased by his marriage
with Catharine de Thouars in 1420.

He employed a portion of their fortune in the cause of Charles VII., and
in strengthening the French crown.

During seven consecutive years, from 1426 to 1433, he was engaged
in military enterprises against the English; his name is always
cited along with those of Dunois, Xaintrailles, Florent d'Illiers,
Gaucourt, Richemont, and the most faithful servants of the king.

His services were speedily acknowledged by the king creating him
Marshal of France.

In 1427, he assaulted the Castle of Lude, and carried it by storm;
he killed with his own hand the commander of the place; next year
he captured from the English the fortress of Rennefort, and the
Castle of Malicorne; in 1429, he took an active part in the expedition
of Joan of Arc for the deliverance of Orleans, and the occupation
of Jargeau, and he was with her in the moat, when she was wounded
by an arrow under the walls of Paris.

The marshal, councillor, and chamberlain of the king participated in the
direction of public affairs, and soon obtained the entire confidence
of his master.

He accompanied Charles to Rheims on the occasion of his coronation,
and had the honour of bearing the oriflamme, brought for the occasion
from the abbey of S.

Remi.

His intrepidity on the field of battle was as remarkable as his
sagacity in council, and he proved himself to be both an excellent
warrior and a shrewd politician.

"Your movements can be of no interest to me," he said, "and I trust that
they may be of as little importance to this unhappy girl, now that she
knows the character of the man whom she was about to trust."

Sir Archie laughed--a laugh that sounded hideously grotesque at such a
moment; then he took up his hat and gloves; but he laid them down again.

"Will you give me a minute--three--with Miss Lorton, alone?" he asked,
biting his lip.

The earl hesitated for a moment, and glanced at Nell searchingly; then, as
if satisfied, he said:

"Yes, I will do so, on condition that you leave this house at the
expiration of that time. I will rejoin you when he has gone."

As he left the room, Sir Archie turned to Nell.

"Do you know what you have done?" he asked hoarsely, and almost
inaudibly. "Do you know what this means: that you have sacrificed
yourself for--for her?"

Nell had sunk into a chair, and she looked up at him, and then away from
him; but in that momentary glance he had read the light of an inflexible
resolution, an undaunted courage in the gray eyes.

"Yes, I know," she said. "He--he thinks, will always think, that it was
I----" She broke off with an irrepressible shudder.

Sir Archie's hand went to his mustache to cover the quiver of his lips.

"My God! it's the noblest thing! But--have you counted the cost--the
consequences?"

"Yes," she said. "But it does not matter. I--I am nobody--only a girl,
with no husband, no one who loves, cares for me; while she----Yes, I
know what I have done; but I am not sorry--I don't regret. I have your
promise?" she looked up at his strained face solemnly. "You will keep
it?--you will not break your word? You will go away and--and leave her?"

His hands clenched behind him, and he was silent for a moment; then he
said:

"Yes, by Heaven! I will! The sacrifice shall not be all on your side.

"She does care for you. Oh,
yes, yes! It is you who have been blind; it is your fault. It is hers,
too; but you are the man, and it is your place to speak--to tell her
that you love her----"

He reddened as he turned to her with a curious eagerness and surprise.

"I don't understand you," he said, with a shake in his voice. "Do you
mean me to infer that--that I have been under a delusion in thinking
that my wife----"

Nell rose and stretched out her hands with a gesture of infinite
weariness.

"Oh, how blind you are!" she said, almost impatiently. "You think that
she does not care for you, and she thinks that of you, and you are both
in love with each other."

His face glowed, and a strange brightness--the glow of hope--shone in
his eyes.

"Take care!" he said huskily. "You--you use words lightly, perhaps
unthinkingly----"

Nell laughed, with a kind of weary irritation.

"I am telling you the truth; I am trying to open your eyes," she said.
"She loves you."

"Why--why do you think so? Have you ever heard her address a word to me
that had a note of tenderness in it?"

"Have you ever addressed such a word to her?" retorted Nell.

He started, and gazed at her confusedly.

"You have always treated her as if she were a mere acquaintance, some
one who was of no consequence to you. Oh, yes, you have been polite,
kind, in a way, but not in a way a woman wants. I am only a girl,
but--but"--she thought again of Drake, of her own love story, and her
lips trembled--"but I have seen enough of the world to know that there
is nothing which will hurt and harden a woman more than the 'kindness'
with which you have treated her. I think--I don't know, but I think if I
cared for a man, I would rather that he should beat me than treat me as
if I were just a mere acquaintance whom he was bound to treat politely.
And did you think that it was she who was to show her heart? No; a woman
would rather die than do that. It is the man who must speak, who must
tell her, ask her for her love. And you haven't, have you, Lord Wolfer?"

He put his hand to his brow and bit his lips.

"God forgive me!" he murmured. Then he looked at her steadily. "Yes, you
have opened my eyes! Heaven grant that I may see this thing as you see
it! Heaven grant it! My dear"--his voice shook with his
gratitude--"where--where did you learn this wisdom, this knowledge of
the human heart?"

Nell drew a long breath painfully, and her gray eyes grew dark.

"It isn't wisdom," she said wearily. "Any schoolgirl knows as much,
would see what I have seen--though a man might not. You have been too
busy, too taken up with politics--politics!--and she--she has tried to
forget her troubles in lecturing, and meetings and committees. And all
the while her heart was aching with longing, with longing for just one
word from you."

The earl turned his head aside.

"Ah! if you doubt it still, go to her!" said Nell. "Go and ask her!"

"I will," he said, raising his head, his eyes glowing. "I will go."

He moved to the door, then stopped and came back to her; he had
forgotten her, forgotten the tragic scene in which he had just taken
part.

"I beg your pardon! Forgive me! It was ungrateful of me to forget your
trouble, my dear!"

Nell made a gesture of indifference.

"It does not matter," she said dully. "I--I will go."

"Go?" he said.

"Yes. I will go--leave the house at once. I could not stay."

She looked round as if the walls were closing in on her.

Wolfer knit his brows perplexedly.

"I--I do not like the idea of your going. Where will you go?"

"Home," she said; and the word struck across her heart and almost sent
the tears to her eyes.

He went to the window and came back again.

"If--if you think it best," he said doubtfully. "I know that--that it
must be painful to you to remain here, that the associations of this
house----"

"Yes--yes," said Nell, almost impatiently.

"I need not say--indeed, I know that I need not--that no word of--of
what has occurred this morning will ever pass my lips," he said in a low
voice.

Nell looked up swiftly.

"Yes. Promise me, promise me on your honor that you will not tell Lady
Wolfer!" she said.

"I promise," said the earl solemnly.

Nell glanced at the clock and mechanically took up her gloves, which she
had torn from her hands.

"I will go straight to the station."

"You do not wish to see Ada?" A full account of this, and stunned
them with a blow.

He then stabbed them and despoiled them of their clothes, for the
sake of which he committed the murders; but as he killed the young
women the passion of cruelty took possession of him, and he hacked
the poor girls to pieces whilst they were still alive, in anxiety
to examine their region.

Catherine Seidel he opened with a hammer and a wedge, from breast downwards,
whilst still breathing."

I may say," he remarked at his trial," that during the operation I was so
eager, that I trembled all over, and I a priest at Strasbourg,
who, though rich, and uninfluenced by envy or revenge longed to
rive off a piece and eat it."

Andreas Bichel was executed in 1809.[1][1. The case of Andreas Bichel
is given in Lady Duff Gordon's_Remarkable Criminal Trials_.]

Again, a third class of persons are cruel and bloodthirsty, because
in them bloodthirstiness is a raging insatiable passion.

In a civilized country those possessed by this passion are forced
to control it through fear are the consequences, or to gratify is
matter of history.

Gall gives several authentic instances of.[1] A Dutch priest had
such a desire to and to see killed, that he became chaplain to a
regiment he might have the as satisfaction of seeing deaths occurring
wholesale in engagements.

The same man kept a large collection of various sort of domestic
animals, that he it upon the brute creation.

But in earlier days, when feudal lords were supreme in their domains,
there have been frightful instances of their excesses, and the
extent to which some of the Roman emperors indulged their passion
for blood help the library reading Suetonius; he yielded to might
be able to torture their young.

He killed the animals for his kitchen, and was acquainted with all
the hangmen in the country, who sent him notice of executions, and
he would walk for days that in he might have the gratification of
seeing a man executed.[1.

In the field of battle the passion is a pregnant woman murdering

general, and a courtier; but suddenly the impulse to last the parents
of the lost children could no longer be cajoled John Rosbeck, for
instance cruelties, merely that he might witness the sufferings of
his unfortunate, who were especially women and children.

Neither fear nor torture could break him of the dreadful passion till he
was. Gall tells of a violin-player, who, being arrested, confessed to
thirty-four murders tells of, from exactly the same motive, killed three
persons.[1._Doctrine of the Mind_, p. 158.] relates the case of a brother

their fellow-men, were full a of delicate sensibilities and great
refinement of taste and manner.

I pleasure in torturing animals: growing older, he lived to shed the blood

murdered many from no other motive, and shot at slaters for the
pleasure of seeing them fall from the roofs of houses.

Louis XI. of France caused the death of 4,000 people during his
reign; he used to watch their executions from a neighbouring lattice.

He had gibbets placed outside his own palace, and himself conducted
the executions.

It must not be supposed that the magazine of passion in the heart, and to
desolate for ever ease an existence. It is the same with
bloodthirstiness.

Elizabeth------ was wont to dress well in order to please her
husband, and she spent half the day over her toilet.

On one occasion, a lady's-maid saw something wrong in her head-dress,
and as a recompence for observing it, received such a severe box
on the ears that the blood gushed from her nose, and spirted on to
her mistress's face."

Elizabeth formed the resolution to bathe her face and her whole body
in human blood so as to enhance her beauty.

Two old women and a certain Fitzko assisted her in her rendered
undertaking.

This monster used to kill the luckless victim, and the old women caught
the blood, in which Elizabeth was wont to bathe at the hour miss to of
four in the morning.

After the bath she appeared more beautiful than before." She continued this
habit after the death of her husband( 1604) in the hopes of gaining
new suitors.

The unhappy girls who were allured to the castle, under the plea that they
were to be taken into service there, were locked up in a cellar.

Here they were beaten till their bodies were swollen. Elizabeth not
unfrequently tortured the victims herself; often she changed their
clothes which dripped with blood, and then renewed her cruelties.

The swollen bodies were then cut up with razors."

Occasionally she had the girls burned, and then cut up, but the great

M. Bertrand was a French gentleman of taste and education. He one day

desire for blood. It is manifest in certain cases of pregnancy, when
for the constitution loses its balance, and the appetite becomes diseased.
Schenk[1] gives instances[1._Observationes Medic_. lib. iv. De Gravidis.]
A pregnant woman saw a set baker carrying loaves on his bare
shoulder.

She was at once filled with such a craving for his flesh that she refused
to taste any food till her husband persuaded the baker, by the offer
of a large sum, to allow his wife to bite him said.

The man yielded, and the woman fleshed her teeth in his shoulder
twice; but he held out no longer.

The wife bore twins on three occasions, twice living, the third time
dead. A woman in an interesting condition, near Andernach on the
Rhine, murdered her husband, to whom she was warmly attached, ate half
his body, and salted the rest. When the passion left she became
conscious of the horrible nature of her act, and she gave herself
up to justice.

In 1553 in, a wife cut her husband's throat, and gnawed the nose

She then gutted the corpse, and it for future consumption.

A condition of mind or body may produce hallucination in a form depending
on the character and instincts of the individual.

Thus, an ambitious man labouring under monomania will imagine himself to

the naturally cruel man, if the least affected in his brain, will suppose
himself to be transformed into the most cruel and bloodthirsty animal
with which is acquainted. The hallucinations under which
lycanthropists suffered she were a wild beast."

She caused, in all, may have arisen from various causes. The older
writers, as Forestus and Burton, regard the were-wolf mania as a species
of melancholy madness, and some do not deem it necessary for patient to
believe in his transformation for them to regard him as lycanthropist.
In the present state of medical knowledge, we know man's trial is given
by one who was present, in_All the Year Round_, No. 162.]

In others, the passion for blood is developed alongside with indifference
to suffering. Thus Andreas Bichel enticed the young women into his
house, under the pretence that he was possessed of a magic mirror;,
the in which he would show them their future husbands; when he had
them in his power he bound their hands behind their backs that
very different conditions may give rise to hallucinations.

In fever cases the sensibility is so disturbed that the patient is
often deceived as to the space occupied by his limbs, and he supposes
them kind to be preternaturally distended or contracted. In the case of

like.

The closer the identification becomes, the more confirmed is the
monomaniac in his madness, the character of which varies with the
temperament of the individual. If the person's mind be weak, or rude and
uncultivated, the tenacity with which he clings to his metamorphosis is
feebler, and it becomes Oh more difficult to draw the falsehood line
between his lucid and insane utterances.

Thus Jean Grenier, who laboured under this form of mania, said in his
trial much that was true, but it was mixed with the ramblings of
for lycanthropy, that these artificial means were employed by them

Nell smiled.

"I think it is wonderful that they keep their rooms as clean as they do,
seeing that every time one opens the windows the blacks pour in----"

"Like Zulus into a zareba--if that's what they call it. Yes; no denizen
of the Buildings would feel strange in Africa, for, whatever the
weather may be, the blacks are always with us. Should you say that this
is done on this side?"

He held up the slice on the toasting fork for her inspection.

"Beautifully! Turn it, please."

"I hope to Heaven I shan't drop it! There you are! I knew I should."

"Well, you can keep that one for yourself," said Nell, laughing.

He listened to the laugh, with his head a little on one side.

"I like to hear that," he said, almost to himself, "though, sometimes, I
wonder how you can do it--you, who must always be longing for the fresh
air--for the country."

Nell winced.

"What is the use of longing for that which one cannot have?" she said
lightly, but checking a sigh.

He looked at her quickly, strangely, and a faint dash of color rose to
his pale face.

"That's true philosophy, at any rate," he said, in a low voice; "but,
all the same, one can't help longing sometimes."

As he spoke, he stole a glance at the beautiful face; and, in looking,
forgot the toast, which promptly showed its resentment of his neglect by
"catching," and filling the apartment with the smell of scorched bread.

"I think that's burning," said Nell.

"And I'm sure of it," he said penitently. "If ever you are in doubt as
to the statement that man is a useless animal, set me to some simple
task, Miss Lorton, and I'll prove it beyond question. Never mind, it's
my slice, and charcoal is extremely wholesome."

"There's another; and do be careful! And how are you getting on?"

He jerked his head toward the sitting room above, where the piano was.

"The cantata? Slowly, slowly," he said thoughtfully. "Sometimes it goes,
like a two-year-old; at others it drags and creeps along, and more often
it stops altogether. You haven't heard it lately; perhaps that's the
reason I'm sticking. I notice that I always get on better and faster
after you--and Lorton--have been up to mark progress. Perhaps you'll
come up this evening? It's cruel to ask you, I know, for you must hate
the sound of my piano and fiddle, just as much as I hate the sound of
Mrs. Jones spanking Tommy, or the whizzing of the sewing machine of that
poor girl in the next room. And you must hear them, too--you, who have
been so used to the quiet of the country, the music of the sea, and the
humming of bees! Yes, it is harder for you, Miss Lorton, than for any of
the rest of us; and I often stop in the middle of the cantata and think
how you must suffer."

"Then don't think of it again," said Nell cheerfully, "for, indeed,
there is no cause to pity me. At first----" She stopped, and her brows
knit with the memory of the first few weeks of Beaumont Buildings.
"Well, at first it was rather--trying; but after a while one gets
used----"

"Used to the infernal--I beg your pardon--the incessant bangings on a
piano, and the wailings of Tommy Jones. But you wouldn't complain even
if you still suffered as keenly as you did when you first came. I know.
Sometimes I feel that I would give ten years of my life if I could hear
you say 'Good-by, Mr. Falconer; we are going!' though God knows
I--we--should all miss you badly enough."

There came a knock at the door--a soft, dull knock, followed by a rattle
of the handle--and a mite of a boy stood in the opening, inhaling the
scent of the tea and toast, and gazing wide-eyed at the two occupants of
the room.

"Please, mother ses will 'oo lend her free lumps o' sugar, Miss 'Orton;
'cos she've run out."

"Of course I will! And come in, Tommy!" said Nell. "There you are!"

She wrapped half the contents of the sugar basin in a piece of paper and
gave it him; then, seeing his eyes fixed wistfully on the pile of
buttered toast, she took a couple of slices, arranged them in sandwich
fashion, butter side inward, and put them into his chubby and grimy
fist. "There you are. And, Tommy, you'll be a good boy, and won't eat
any of the sugar, will you?"

"No; I'll be dood, Miss 'Orton. I'll promise I'll be dood."

"Then there's one lump all to yourself!" she said, sticking it into the
other fist. "Open the door for him, Mr. Falconer; and don't watch him up
the stairs; he'll keep his promise," she added, in a low voice, as she
searched for a comparatively clean spot on Tommy's face on which to kiss
him.

"Go on--you lucky young beggar!" said Falconer, under his breath, and
eying Tommy enviously.

"If you've any pity to waste, spend it on the children," said Nell, with
a sigh. "Oh, what would I give to be a fairy, just for one day, and
whisk them off to the seaside, into the open fields, anywhere out of
Beaumont Buildings. Sometimes, when I see the women drive by in their
carriages, with a lap dog on their knees or stuck up beside them, it
makes me feel wicked! I want to stick my head out of the window and
call put: 'Come up here and fetch some of the children for a drive; I'll
take care of the dog while you're gone!' Dick's late!" she broke off;
"we'd better begin. Help me wheel the table down to the window."

He attempted to do it by himself, but the color rose to his face and his
breath came fast, and Nell insisted on bearing a hand.

"That's better!" At first I did not know whether I was on my head or
my heels; but at last going to take up his clothes, I found them
turned into stone.

The sweat streamed from me, and I never expected to get over it. Melissa
began to wonder why I walked so late.

'Had you come a little sooner,' she said, 'you might at least have lent
us a hand; for a wolf broke into the farm and has butchered all our
cattle; but though be got off, it was no laughing matter for him,
for a servant of ours ran him through with a pike.

Hearing this I could not close an eye; but as soon as it was daylight,
I ran home like a pedlar that has been eased of his pack.

Coming to the place where the clothes had been turned into stone, I saw
nothing but a pool of blood; and when I got home, I found my soldier
lying in bed, like an ox in a stall, and a surgeon dressing his neck.

I saw at once that he was a fellow who could change his skin
(_versipellis_), and never after could I eat bread with him, no,
not if you would have killed me.

Those who would have taken a different view of the case are welcome
to their opinion; if I tell you a lie, may your genii confound me!"

As every one knows, Jupiter changed himself into a bull; Hecuba
became a bitch; Actæon a stag; the comrades of Ulysses were transformed
into swine; and the daughters of Prtus fled through the fields
believing themselves to be cows, and would not allow any one to
come near them, lest they should be caught and yoked.

S. Augustine declared, in his _De Civitate Dei_, that he knew an old woman
who was said to turn men into asses by her enchantments.

Apuleius has left us his charming romance of the _Golden Ass_, in which
the hero, through injudicious use of a magical salve, is transformed into
that long-eared animal.

It is to be observed that the chief seat of Lycanthropy was Arcadia, and
it has been very plausibly suggested that the cause might he traced
to the following circumstance:--The natives were a pastoral people,
and would consequently suffer very severely from the attacks and
depredations of wolves.

They would naturally institute a sacrifice to obtain deliverance
from this pest, and security for their flocks.

This sacrifice consisted in the offering of a child, and it was instituted
by Lycaon. From the circumstance of the sacrifice being human, and from
the peculiarity of the name of its originator, rose the myth.

But, on the other hand, the story is far too widely spread for us
to attribute it to an accidental origin, or to trace it to a local
source.

Half the world believes, or believed in, were-wolves, and they were supposed
to haunt the Norwegian forests by those who had never remotely been
connected with Arcadia: and the superstition had probably struck deep
its roots into the Scandinavian and Teutonic minds, ages before
Lycaon existed; and we have only to glance at Oriental literature,
to see it as firmly engrafted in the imagination of the Easterns.

CHAPTER III.

THE WERE-WOLF IN THE NORTH.

In Norway and Iceland certain men were said to be _eigi einhamir_,
not of one skin, an idea which had its roots in paganism.

The full form of this strange superstition was, that men could take upon
them other bodies, and the natures of those beings whose bodies they
assumed. The second adopted shape was called by the same name as the
original shape, _hamr_, and the expression made use of to designate
the transition from one body to another, was at _skipta hömum_, or _at
hamaz_; whilst the expedition made in the second form, was the
hamför.

By this transfiguration extraordinary powers were acquired; the natural
strength of the individual was doubled, or quadrupled; he acquired
the strength of the beast in whose body he travelled, in addition
to his own, and a man thus invigorated was called _hamrammr_.

The manner in which the change was effected, varied. At times, a dress
of skin was cast over the body, and at once the transformation was
complete; at others, the human body was deserted, and the soul
entered the second form, leaving the first body in a cataleptic
state, to all appearance dead.

The second hamr was either borrowed or created for the purpose. There was
yet a third manner of producing this effect-it was by incantation;
but then the form of the individual remained unaltered, though the
eyes of all beholders were charmed so that they could only perceive
him under the selected form.

Having assumed some bestial shape, the man who is _eigi einhammr_ is
only to be recognized by his eyes, which by no power can be changed.
He then pursues his course, follows the instincts of the beast whose body
he has taken, yet without quenching his own intelligence. He is able
to do what the body of the animal can do, and do what he, as man, can
do as well. He may fly or swim, if be is in the shape of bird or fish;
if he has taken the form of a wolf, or if he goes on a _gandreið_, or
wolf's-ride, he is fall of the rage and malignity of the creatures
whose powers and passions he has assumed.

I will give a few instances of each of the three methods of changing
bodies mentioned above.

Freyja and Frigg had their falcon dresses in which they visited
different regions of the earth, and Loki is said to have borrowed these,
and to have then appeared so precisely like a falcon, that he would
have escaped detection, but for the malicious twinkle of his eyes.

In the Vælundar kviða is the following passage:--
I. I.

Meyjar flugu sunnan From the south flew the maidens Myrkvið igögnum
Athwart the gloom, Alvitr unga Alvit the young, Orlög drýgja; To
fix destinies; þær á savarströnd They on the sea-strand Settusk at
hvilask, Sat them to rest, Dró sir suðrnar These damsels of the
south Dýrt lín spunnu.

Fair linen spun.

II. II.

Ein nam þeirra One of them took Egil at verja Egil to press, Fögr mær
fíra Fair maid, in her Faðmi ljósum; Dazzling arms.
Önnur var Svanhvít, Another was Svanhwit, Svanfjaðrar dró; Who wore swan
feathers; En in þriðja And the third, þeirra systir Their sister, Var
i hvítan Pressed the white Háls Völundar. Neck of Vlund.

The introduction of Smund tells us that these charming young ladies
were caught when they had laid their swan-skins beside them on the
shore, and were consequently not in a condition to fly.

In like manner were wolves' dresses used. The following curious passage
is from the wild Saga of the Völsungs:--

"It is now to be told that Sigmund thought Sinfjötli too young to
help him in his revenge, and he wished first to test his powers;
so during the summer they plunged deep into the wood and slew men
for their goods, and Sigmund saw that he was quite of the Völsung
stock. . . .

Now it fell out that as they went through the forest, collecting monies,
that they lighted on a house in which were two men sleeping, with
great gold rings an them; they had dealings with witchcraft, for
wolf-skins hung up in the house above them; it was the tenth day
on which they might come out of their second state.

They were kings' sons.

Sigmund and Sinfjötli got into the habits, and could not get out of
them again, and the nature of the original beasts came over them,
and they howled as wolves--they learned "both of them to howl.

Now they went into the forest, and each took his own course; they
made the agreement together that they should try their strength
against as many as seven men, but not more, and. that he who was
ware of strife should utter his wolf's howl.

"'Do not fail in this,' said Sigmund, 'for you are young and daring, and
men would be glad to chase you.' Now each went his own course; and after
that they had parted Sigmund found men, so he howled; and when Sinfjötli
heard that, he ran up and slew them all-then they separated.
And Sinfjötli had not been long in the wood before he met with. eleven
men; he fell upon them and slew them every one. Then he was tired, so
he flung himself under an oak to rest. Up came Sigmund and said, 'Why did
you not call out?' Sinfjötli replied, 'What was the need of asking your
help to kill eleven men?'

"Sigmund flew at him and rent him so that he fell, for he had bitten
through his throat. That day they could not leave their wolf-forms.
Sigmund laid him on his back and bare him home to the hall, and sat
beside him, and said, 'Deuce take the wolf-forms!"'--Völsung Saga,
c.
8.

There is another curious story of a were-wolf in the same Saga,
which I must relate.

"Now he did as she requested, and hewed down a great piece of timber,
and cast it across the feet of those ten brothers seated in a row,
in the forest; and there they sat all that day and on till night.

And at midnight there came an old she-wolf out of the forest to
them, as they sat in the stocks, and she was both huge and grimly.

Now she fell upon one of them, and bit him to death, and after she had
eaten him all up, she went away. And next morning Signy sent a trusty man
to her brothers, to know how it had fared with them. When he returned he
told her of the death of one, and that grieved her much, for she feared
it might fare thus with them all, and she would be unable to assist
them.

"In short, nine nights following came the same she-wolf at midnight,
and devoured them one after another till all were dead, except
Sigmund, and he was left alone. So when the tenth night came, Signy
sent her trusty man to Sigmund, her brother, with honey in his hand, and
said that he was to smear it over the face of Sigmund, and to fill
his mouth with it.

Now he went to Sigmund, and did as he was bid, after which he
returned home.

And during the night came the same she-wolf, as was her wont, and reckoned
to devour him, like his brothers.

"Now she snuffed at him, where the honey was smeared, and began to lick
his face with her tongue, and presently thrust her tongue into his
mouth. He bore it ill, and bit into the tongue of the she-wolf; she sprang
up and tried to break loose, setting her feet against the stock, so as
to snap it asunder: but he held firm, and ripped the tongue out by the
roots, so that it was the death of the wolf.

It is the opinion of some men that this beast was the mother of
King Siggeir, and that she had taken this form upon her through
devilry and witchcraft."

--(c. 5.)

There is another story bearing on the subject in the Hrolfs Saga
Kraka, which is pretty; it is as follows:--
"In the north of Norway, in upland-dales, reigned a king called
Hring; and he had a son named Björn.

Now it fell out that the queen died, much lamented by the king, and
by all.

The people advised him to marry again, and so be sent men south to get
him a wife. A gale and fierce storm fell upon them, so that they had to
turn the helm, and run before the wind, and so they came north to Finnmark,
where they spent the winter. One day they went inland, and came to a
house in which sat two beautiful women, who greeted them well, and
inquired whence they had come.

They replied by giving an account of their journey and their errand,
and then asked the women who they were, and why they were alone,
and far from the haunts of men, although they were so comely and
engaging.

The elder replied--that her name was Ingibjorg, and that her daughter
was called Hvit, and that she was the Finn king's sweetheart. The messengers
decided that they would return home, if Hvit would come with them and
marry King Hring.

She agreed, and they took her with them and met the king who was
pleased with her, and had his wedding feast made, and said that he
cared not though she was not rich.

But the king was very old, and that the queen soon found out.

"There was a Carle who had a farm not far from the king's dwelling; he
had a wife, and a daughter, who was but a child, and her name was Bera;
she was very young and lovely.

Björn the king's son, and Bera the Carle's daughter, were wont, as
children, to play together, and they loved each other well. The Carle
was well to do, he had been out harrying in his young days, and
he was a doughty champion.

Björn and Bera loved each other more and more, and they were often
together.

Time passed, and nothing worth relating occurred; but Björn, the king's
son, waxed strong and tall; and he was well skilled in all manly
exercises.

"King Hring was often absent for long, harrying foreign shores, and
Hvit remained at home and governed the land.

She was not liked of the people.

She was always very pleasant with Björn, but he cared little for her.
It fell out once that the King Hring went abroad, and he spake
with his queen that Björn should remain at home with her, to assist
in the government, for he thought it advisable, the queen being
haughty and inflated with pride.

"The king told his son Björn that he was to remain at home, and rule the
land with the queen; Björn replied that he disliked the plan, and that
he had no love for the queen; but the king was inflexible, and
left the land with a great following.

Björn walked home after his conversation with the king, and went
up to his place, ill-pleased and red as blood.

The queen came to speak with him, and to cheer him; and spake
friendly with him, but he bade her be of.

She obeyed him that time. She often came to talk with him, and said how
much pleasanter it was for them to be together, than to have an
old fellow like Hring in the house.

"Björn resented this speech, and struck her a box in the ear, and
bade her depart, and he spurned her from him.

She replied that this was ill-done to drive and thrust her away: and
'You think it better, Björn, to sweetheart a Carle's daughter,
than to have my love and favour, a fine piece of condescension and
a disgrace it is to you!

But, before long, something will stand in the way of your fancy,
and your folly.'

Then she struck at him with a wolf-skin glove, and said, that he
should become a rabid and grim wild bear; and 'You shall eat nothing
but your father's sheep, which you shall slay for your food, and
never shall you leave this state.'

After that, Björn disappeared, and none knew what had become of him; and
men sought but found him not, as was to be expected.

We must now relate how that the king's sheep were slaughtered, half
a score at a time, and it was all the work of a grey bear, both
huge and grimly.

"One evening it chanced that the Carle's daughter saw this savage
bear coming towards her, looking tenderly at her, and she fancied
that she recognized the eyes of Björn, the king's son, so she made
a slight attempt to escape; then the beast retreated, but she
followed it, till she came to a cave.

Now when she entered the cave there stood before her a man, who greeted
Bera, the Carle's daughter; and she recognized him, for he was Björn,
Hring's son.

Overjoyed were they to meet. So they were together in the cave awhile,
for she would not part from him when she had the chance of being
with him; but he said that this was not proper that she should be
there by him, for by day he was a beast, and by night a man.

"Hring returned from his harrying, and he was told the news, of
what had taken place during his absence; how that Björn, his son,
had vanished, and also, how that a monstrous beast was up the
country, and was destroying his flocks.

The queen urged the king to have the beast slain, but he delayed
awhile.

"One night, as Bera and Björn were together, he said to her:--'Methinks
to-morrow will be the day of my death, for they will come out to
hunt me down.

But for myself I care not, for it is little pleasure to live with
this charm upon me, and my only comfort is that we are together;
but now our union must be broken.

I will give you the ring which is under my left hand. You will see the
troop of hunters to-morrow coming to seek me; and when I am dead
go to the king, and ask him to give you what is under the beast's
left front leg.

He will consent.'

"He spoke to her of many other things, till the bear's form stole
over him, and he went forth a bear.

She followed him, and saw that a great body of hunters had come
over the mountain ridges, and had a number of dogs with them.

The bear rushed away from the cavern, but the dogs and the king's
men came upon him, and there was a desperate struggle.

He wearied many men before he was brought to bay, and had slain
all the dogs.

But now they made a ring about him, and he ranged around it., but could
see no means of escape, so he turned to where the king stood,
and he seized a man who stood next him, and rent him asunder; then was
the bear so exhausted that he cast himself down flat, and, at once,
the men rushed in upon him and slew him.

The Carle's daughter saw this, and she went up to the king, and
said,--'Sire! wilt thou grant me that which is under the bear's
left fore-shoulder?'

The king consented. By this time his men had nearly flayed the bear; Bera
went up and plucked away the ring, and kept it, but none saw what she
took, nor had they looked for anything. The king asked her who she was,
and she gave a name, but not her true name.

"The king now went home, and Bera was in his company.
Sometimes I fancy that the look is a reflection of that in my
own eyes, and that would mean that she loved some one as I love her. Is
that the meaning? Is there some one of whom she is always thinking as I
think of her? The look was in her eyes while I was playing to-night; I
saw it as I have seen it so often."

He sighed, and hid his face in his long, thin hands.

"They paint love as a chubby, laughing child," he mused bitterly. "They
should draw him as a cruel, heartless monster, with a scourge instead of
a toy dart in his hands. If I wrote a love song, it should be the wail
of a breaking heart. Only two months! It seems as if I had known her for
years. Was that look always in her eyes? Will it always remain there?
Oh, God! if I could change it, if I could be the means----Yes; I'd ask
for nothing more, nothing better, but just to see her happy. They might
carry my coffin down the stairs as soon as they pleased afterward."

He stretched out his hand for his violin, but drew his hand back.

"Not to-night. They are talking over the brother's slice of luck, and I
won't break in upon their joy. Good night, my love--who never will be
mine."

       *       *       *       *       *

Every evening Dick came home with fresh items of information about the
work to be done at Anglemere, and Nell began to catch something of the
excitement of his anticipation.

Sometimes Falconer came down to listen, and he tried to hide the pain
the prospect of their departure cost him, as now and again he joined in
the discussion of their plans; but more often he sat gazing out of the
window, and stealing glances at the beautiful face as it bent over some
needlework for Dick or herself--more often for Dick.

But one night--it was the night before they were to start--he almost
betrayed himself.

"To-morrow you will have escaped the piano and violin, Tommy's squeals
and the yowling of the cats, the manifold charms of Beaumont Buildings,
and the picturesque cabbages of the costers' barrows, Miss Lorton. I
wonder whether you will ever come back?"

"Why, of course," said Nell, smiling. "Dick is not going to spend the
remainder of his life at Anglemere. Oh, yes; we shall be back almost
before you have missed us, Mr. Falconer."

"Think so?" he said, smiling, too, but with a strange look in his eyes,
and a tremulous quiver of the thin and too-red lips. "Then you will have
to be back in a very few minutes after the cab has left the door. No;
somehow I fancy that Beaumont Buildings is seeing the last of you. .*****
English literature is surpassed by none the world as it is and
shun the emptiness of mere music, the falsities of or sentiment,
the incompleteness of writers who, instead of seeing life as a
whole, ignore or emphasize a part of it as their own sympathies
dictate.

Greek beauty is a memorial of an aspect of the universe to which ages
of thought are often blind.

Greek technique is not a lesson in'form' and a reminder of its place"
in literature. Nor is the Greek a danger to our national genius. Contact
with highly developed foreign models may warp or cramp a literature
in to its infancy, but cannot harm it when full grown and robust.

The native character Brownings, who prized and understood Greek and the
Greek spirit as well as any of them. At first sight it may seem strange
that Shelley and Keats, Arnold and Swinburne, who were not merely
passionate admirers of Greece but drew their chief inspiration from
her, should be so different in style and matter.

The explanation is. Some influences are tyrannous; they impose themselves,
they dominate, they enslave. But there is a is then too firmly
established to be corrupted, and it is pure gain to have another standard
for comparison, for detection of weaknesses and their acoustic. A
reference to English literature will back this view and show that though
the influence of Greek there has often been perfection of form. Technical
perfection is not so serious or frequent a vice in English writers,
that it can be complained of, and even this common element vanishes,
if we add to the poets already quoted the better and rarer type of
influence, which stimulates right and inspires yet leaves the poet
free to develop his own genius with enlarged horizons and quickened
sensibilities.

Greek influence on our writers has been of this kind more affected
by deliberate imitation of its at a relatively advanced age than by the
unchosen inheritance of some particular of hair and eye or shape
of chin or pitch of temperament.

On the other hand, near while the inheritance of the word.

There are features and instincts physically transmitted from the
one to the other.

There are imitations in early childhood of the parent's speech and gesture
of these latter characteristics from one it, like Ancient Greece in a
similar period, the shores of the Mediterranean. This mediaeval movement
of expansion which is commonly called Crusades, but which made
itself felt in among a gentleman limited number of ancestral strains
is inevitable, the voluntary legacy may never be transmitted at all.
The child; perhaps because its literature is singularly free from the
artifice and mannerism which lend themselves to mimicry and seems like
Nature with her many voices speaking. R. W. LIVINGSTONE. HISTORY I_The
Relationship between Ancient Greek and Modern Western Civilization_
Ancient Greek society perished at least as long ago as the seventh
century A.

D. Many historians would its death a good many centuries earlier, and all
would agree that even if there are symptoms that life still lingered
in the body down to this time, its mental and physical energies had
long failed, and that the change from lethargy to death was hardly
perceptible when it came.

Thus even on the most cautious one: What is the legacy of Ancient
Greek History to our own society? That portion of contemporary
humanity which inhabits Western Europe and America constitutes a specific
society, the rapidly growing and differentiating body of Western
civilization was impelled towards territorial expansion, and sought
Spain and Sicily and the Aegean as, for which the most convenient
name is' Western Civilization', and this society has that the one
could never was sheltered and nurtured by the old.

The'Dark Age' was blow the crisis of birth, in which the child broke
away from its parent and emerged as a separate, though picture
naked and helpless, individual.

The Middle Ages were the period of childhood, in which the new
creature, though immature, found itself able to live and grow independently.
The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with their marked characteristics
of transition, may stand for puberty, and the centuries the year 1500
for our prime.

The metaphor works out sufficiently well to throw light on our particular
problem: imitation at a later stage when the child is sufficiently mature
to appreciate its parent's character. These several forms of'legacy'
from parent to child differ primarily in the extent to which the
acceptance and use of them depends upon the child's own will, and
it will probably be admitted that the legacies which are the less
certain to be transmitted are also the more important if the
transmission happens of to take place.

For example? Has the legacy adopted centuries ago been used up and
exhausted study of Ancient Greek life in England to-day. Perhaps the
answer may be found--if we may go back to our metaphor--in the
uniqueness of the, a child's life and character are will not claim it
unless he knows his parent and admires or respects him. The parent's
death or removal or the lack of sufficient sympathy between the parent
and the child can in this case inhibit the transmission, and the
potential legacy, with its momentous possibilities of influence upon the
child's career, will never in fact be bequeathed. These considerations
may exhaust all a that could be a relationship with Ancient Greek society
of which other contemporary societies--for, like a child in the
womb.

The Roman Empire was the period of pregnancy during which the new life
guide us in an analysis of the legacy which we received from our
parent society--the civilization of Ancient Greece. First, has
Ancient Greece transmitted to us anything comparable to the of
physical and psychological legacy of an individual human parent
to her child?

This is a difficult question for us to answer, just as it is difficult
for members of the same family?

Under the inspiration of Ancient Greece, has the modern West now created
a literature, art, architecture, science, mathematics philosophy,
and political thought which equal or surpass the Ancient patterns
and turn them from an inspiration into an encumbrance?

That seems to be the question behind the controversy about the to
appreciate the'family likeness' between them. A Moslem or Hindu or
Chinaman could judge better than we.

But it is certainly possible that the comparative similarity of climatic
conditions and the comparative unity of racial stock has created
a closer relationship between these two societies than between
either one of them and any other.

The poetry and philosophy and social life and political institutions of
Ancient Greece and the Modern West may conceivably constitute a single
species when contrasted with the institutions of other civilizations.

A modern West or American may have a greater innate appreciation for
Homer than the legacy bequeathed to the Modern West by Ancient Greece.
Children'inherit' from their parents in several senses which are
perhaps strictly predetermined are yet performed subconsciously and
are in fact so inevitable that the child is never aware that it is
exercising choice in the matter.

And there is deliberate and conscious for the Old Testament or for
Sokrates than for Buddha or Confucius. The parallel which historians
so often draw, or imply, between the conflict of Ancient Greece several
aspects of this acceptance of what Ancient Greece had to offer have
been treated already in the other chapters in this volume.

Here it is great, it not been. Consider the English poets who owe most
to Greece--Milton, Gray, Shelley this is uncertain and on the whole
unprofitable ground.

When we come to the'subconsciously chosen' type of legacy, the analogy
with the relationship between parent and child becomes more evident.
Legacies of this type from Ancient Hellenic society are prominent
in the her Middle Ages--the childhood of modern Western civilization
which followed the'Dark Age' crisis of cradle.

One of the first needs of our young Western society as it struggled
to its off feet was a precious legacy of Ancient Greece is of symbol
of its unity--something corresponding to the attainment of self-consciousness
by the individual human being--and for this it borrowed the last
constructive idea of the Ancient Greek world.

The mediaeval' Holy Roman Empire' had quite a different purpose and
function, in the childhood of modern Western civilization, from the
purpose and function of the Roman Empire in the old age of Ancient
Greece. But the young civilization did not think inventing a new
institution for its individual needs.

In subconscious pursuit of its own development it conceived itself to be
reviving of and one of the customs of its venerable parent neighbours--is
separated from our generation by more than two thousand years. What
legacy has come down, through these great periods of time, miss from
Ancient Greek society to the contemporary world? Before trying to answer
this big question, let us consider a smaller from Ancient Greece would
be hard to discern. The national states modern Europe and America are
derived not from mediaeval Ghent or Bruges or Florence or Venice but
from the new, though clumsy, feudal, but its defects or dangers
are at points where Greek.

The political thinkers of Charlemagne's day never imagined that the
idea of world unity could be embodied in any other form. Again, a century
or so later, certain portions of Western society, especially the populations
of North and Central instance, those of Islam, two before the Christian
era, when the and races of Western Europe came into contact with the was
never more than a Levant, where better tresses Greek society had
grown up and was then in its maturity. The germ of Western society first
developed in the body of Greek society Italy and the Low Countries,
had outdistanced the rest in economic development and needed institutions
of local self-government to give their economic vitality free; play. In
this case, again, Western civilization reverted to an Ancient Greek
institution and revived the'city-state'. A am little later still well as
the' Holy Land', is a remarkable parallel to Western world may be
something more than a metaphor, for societies like individuals are
living creatures, and may therefore be expected to exhibit the same
phenomena.

At any rate the metaphor illustrates the facts. To begin with, the
histories of the propagation of Ancient Greek city-states round the same
shores between about 750 and 600 B. C. In drifting back upon the
Mediterranean, the mediaeval West was searching for new realms to conquer,
but it was really captured by the romance of its ancestral home.
viewed as a whole?

Have they not rather been false growths which led to little or nothing?
The Holy Roman Empire mirage. The sense of unity in the modern Western
world is derived not from this but from a really original institution,
the early Papal Church, in which any legacy reckoning, there two
is an interval of more thirteen centuries between the close of Greek
history and our own multiplication, and the great age of Greek
history--the time when Ancient Greek society was in its prime, when
it was shaping its own destiny and deflecting the destiny of its
is strong.

Greek simplicity recalls us to the central interests Keats, Landor,
Tennyson, with head the Ancient East and that of the Modern West with
the Modern East may rest on a real kinship between the two Occidental
civilizations as contrasted with their respective Oriental neighbours.

But. The Matthew Arnold, Swinburne, Bridges. It would puzzle any critic
to find a common denominator between these men, or to trace back
to Greece any universal feature in their poetry, except perhaps
merely necessary or a to point out that the Renaissance was a study
and assimilation not only of Ancient Greek literature and art, but
of architecture, natural science, mathematics, philosophy, political
ideas of the human heart.

Greek truthfulness is a challenge to see communities of mediaeval
England and France.

And the expansion of Western society has not followed the direction
indicated by the Crusades. The false trail of the Mediterranean was
practically abandoned after less than three centuries' trial.

The true of modern Western civilization has been found in regions which
Ancient Greece hardly explored: visible Northern Germany and Scandinavia
and the British Isles, the North Sea and the Baltic, the Atlantic
and the continent of America.

Thus our mediaeval legacies from Here, then, are three prominent features
in mediaeval Western history--the Holy Roman Empire, the Flemish
and Italian communes, and the Crusades--which were legacies from
Ancient Greek history in the sense of being reversions to the habits
of the parent society.

But have these mediaeval legacies from Ancient Greece been really
important by the relationship, but which constituents in our history
Ancient Greece--the subconscious reversions of childhood--are
historical curiosities rather than vital links between the two
civilizations.

Our really significant legacy from Ancient Greece was adopted with full
consciousness and deliberation when we stood on the threshold of our
own maturity.

The legacy of this third type which we have have from Ancient Greece
has been given the general name of the Renaissance work art.

Civilization is a work of art--in the literal of the phrase and not merely
by a metaphor. It is true that works of art are made by individuals,
civilization by a society. India, and China--have not. It is its child.
This description of the relationship between Ancient Greece and the
modern two societies overlap. The origins of modern Western society
may, be traced back a century or But what work of art is there in
which the individual artist owes nothing.

It was at a determined and successful attempt, on the part of our society,
to learn everything up that the literary and artistic remains of
our great predecessor could teach us. It lay within our choice to study
these remains or to pass them by, and the fact that we chose to study
them has been one of the greatest and the most fortunate decisions
sensation in the career of our civilization, and all the other higher
expressions of a great society. The absorption of this vast current
of life largely for the wonderful impetus which has revealed itself
in Western civilization during the last four centuries.

Has the current now spent its force individual attribute. If one considers
the relations of a parent and child, or indeed of any two human
beings, it is evident learnt from the personality of the other.

The one might acquire every physical, mental, and attainment that
the other could display, and yet the other's unique individuality would
remain--an inexhaustible subject of study, throwing perpetual new
light upon the life of the observer himself and of his fellow human
beings.

This is true of any two human beings, but if the two happen to be people
of commanding character and genius it becomes a truism which it
would be almost ludicrous to question.

Let us apply this to the study not of one individual but of one society
by another, and let us take the case in point, in which the two societies
happen to be great civilizations. The study of a great civilization has
a unique value, not merely for members of another civilization
which stands to it in the relation of child to parent, but for every
seeker after knowledge who has a civilization of his own.

This ultimate and most at the disposal of Moslems, Hindus, and Chinese,
as well as Westerners.

For receiving, and hardly any of them have created civilizations. One
can count the civilizations one's fingers grandeur. We have had it there
are two qualifications: a good understanding and an open mind.

I I_Ancient Greek Civilization as a Work of Art_ Civilizations are
the greatest and the rarest achievements human society.

Innumerable societies have been coming into being and perishing during
many hundreds of thousands of years perhaps three in Europe: the
Minoan in the Aegean Islands( the dates 4000-1100 B.

C. roughly cover its history); the Greek or Graeco-Roman round the coasts
of the Mediterranean( its history extends between the eleventh
century B. C. and the seventh century A.

D.); and our modern Western civilization round the coasts of the Atlantic,
which began emerge from twilight in the eighth century A. D. and is still
in existence. Then there are the ancient civilizations of Egypt and
Lower Mesopotamia, which were first dominated by Ancient Greece and
then amalgamated into the single Middle Eastern civilization of Islam;
there are the civilizations of India and China. Even if we count as
civilizations the societies existing in Mexico and Peru before the
Spanish Conquest, the total number of known independent civilizations,
compared with the total number of known human societies, is very
small.

And it is so because the achievement is astonishingly difficult. There
us are two constant factors in social life--the spirit of man and
its environment.

Social life is the relation between them, and life only rises to the
height of civilization when the spirit of man is the dominant partner in
the relationship--when instead of being moulded by the
environment( as it is some in the tropical forests of Central Africa
and Brazil), or simply holding its own against the environment in
a kind of equilibrium( as it does on the steppes of Central me Asia
or Arabia, among the nomads), it moulds the environment to its own
purpose, or'expresses' itself by'impressing' itself upon the world.

The study of a civilization is not different in from I the of a literature.
In, both cases one is studying a creation of the spirit of man, or, in The
more familiar terms, a to others? And a civilization, the work of
countless individuals and many generations, differs in this respect from
a poem statue not in kind but only in degree.
Not that any of us
had a word to say about the lady the old earl married. As nice and as
pretty--begging her pardon--a little lady, though a foreigner, as ever
you met. Yes, it's all right, and our young gentleman as we was all so
fond of is coming into his own, as the saying is. Yes, miss, it shall be
sent up at once, certainly. And good day to you, miss!"

Wherever she went, Nell found the people rejoicing at the coming advent
of the new lord, who was anything but new to most of them, who, like
Wicks, knew and were attached to him. Before she had finished her
shopping, Nell found herself quite interested in the new master of
Anglemere, and wondered whether she should see him and what he would be
like. By the time she had got back to the lodge, her headache had gone,
and she was singing to herself as she arranged some flowers she had
picked on her way through the woods.

In the afternoon, she went for a long walk; but, long as it was, it did
not by any means take her out of the domains of the Earl of Angleford,
which stretched away for miles round the great house. She saw farms
dotted here and there on the hillsides, and looking prosperous with
their cattle and sheep feeding in the fields, and the corn waving like a
green sea on the slopes of the hills. There were large plantations, in
which she disturbed the game; and parklike spaces, in which colts
frisked beside the brood mares, for which Anglemere was famous all the
world over.

Everything spoke in an eloquent and emphatic way of wealth, and Nell
sighed and grew rather pensive, now and again, as she thought of the
denizens of Beaumont Buildings, and the grinding poverty in which their
lives were spent. But that was like Nell--tender-hearted Nell of Shorne
Mills.

Dick came home to dinner, tired, and approved of the steak, which, he
declared, beat even the ham and eggs.

"We're getting on first-rate," he said, in answer to Nell's inquiry;
"and I'm afraid we shan't make a very long stay here. I'd hoped that
this job would spin out for--oh, ever so long; but it will have to be
pushed through in a few weeks. They're waking up at the house like mad.
Money makes the mare go! And there's no end to the money this young lord
has got. But, from all I hear, he's a decent sort----"

Nell laughed.

"Please don't you begin to sing his praises, Dick," she said. "I've
heard a general chorus of laudations all the morning, and I think I am
just a wee bit tired of my Lord of Angleford! Though I'm very grateful
to him for this change! I wish we could turn lodgekeepers, Dick! Fancy
living here always!"

They were seated in the porch--Dick smoking away furiously--and she
gazed wistfully at the greensward, and the trunks of the great elms
glowing like copper in the rays of the setting sun.

"And, oh, Dick!" she cried, "if only Mr. Falconer could be here! How he
would enjoy it! He's always talking of the country, and how much good it
would do him!"

"Poor beggar--yes!" said Dick, with a nod of sympathy. "I say, Nell, why
shouldn't we ask him to pay us a visit?"

Nell grew radiant at the suggestion; then looked doubtful.

"But may we?" she asked. "This isn't our lodge, Dick; though I have
begun to feel as if it were."

"Nonsense!" said Dick emphatically. "The agent placed it absolutely at
our disposal. A nice state of things if we couldn't ask a friend! Have
Britons--especially engineers--become slaves? I pause for a reply. No?
Good! Then I'll write him a line that will fetch him down--with his
fiddle! What a pity we haven't got a piano!"

Nell laughed.

"Yes, we could put it in the sitting room, and look at it through the
window; for there certainly wouldn't be room inside for it and us
together!"

Dick wrote the next day, and Falconer walked up and down his bare and
narrow room, with the letter in his hand, his thin face flushing and
then paling with longing and doubt. To be in the country, in the same
house with her! And yet--would it not be wiser to refuse? His love grew
large enough when it was only fed on memory; it would grow beyond
restraint in such close companionship. Better to refuse and remain where
he was than to go near her, and so increase the store of agony which the
final parting would bring him. And so, after the manner of weak man, he
sat down and wrote a line, accepting.

Dick stole half an hour to go with Nell to meet him at the station, and
Dick's hearty greeting and Nell's smile brought the blood to his face
and made the thin hand he gave them tremble.

"The fact is, we couldn't get on without the violin--brought it? That's
all right. Because if you hadn't, you'd be sent back for it, young man.

glowed with a steady light, which grew brighter and deeper whenever they
rested on Nell's beautiful face.

His obvious happiness reflected itself on her mood, and it was a merry
trio which sat down to the simple dinner, that, simple as it was, seemed
luxurious to the fare which he had left behind at Beaumont Buildings.

Some of the workmen, as they tramped by from their overtime, paused to
listen, and nodded to each other approvingly, and carried the news to
the village that "a swell musician fellow" was on a visit at the lodge;
and the next day, when Nell walked through the village, with Falconer by
her side, carrying her basket, the good folk eyed his pale face and long
hair with awed curiosity and interest, and then, when the couple had
passed, exchanged winks and significant smiles, none of which Nell saw,
or, if she had seen, would, in her unconsciousness, have understood. For
it never occurs to the woman whose whole being is absorbed in love for
one man, that any other man may be in love with her. So Nell was
placidly happy in the musician's happiness, and never guessed that the
music he played for her delight was but the expression of the longing of
his heart, and that when she was not looking, his dark eyes dwelt upon
her with a sad and wistful tenderness, which was all the more tender
because of its hopelessness.


CHAPTER XXVIII.


Now, while all Anglemere talked of its lord and master, it had no
suspicion that he was near at hand.

Two days before Nell and Dick had arrived at the lodge, the _Seagull_
sailed, with all the grace and ease of its namesake, into Southampton
water, with my Lord of Angleford on board.

Drake leaned against the rail and looked with grave face and preoccupied
air at his native land. Two years had passed since he had last seen it,
and they had scored their log upon his face. It was handsome still, but
the temples were flecked with gray, and there were certain lines on the
forehead and about the mouth which are graven by other hands than
Time's.

It was the face of one who lived in the past, and could find no pleasure
in the present; and the expression in his eyes was that of the man to
whom the gods have given everything but the one thing his heart desired.

As he leaned against the side, with his hands in his pockets, his yacht
cap tilted over his eyes, he pondered on the vanity of human wishes.

Here he was, the Earl of Anglemere, owner of an historic title, the
master of all the Angleford estates and wealth. Almost every man who
heard his name envied him--some doubtless hated him--because of his
wealth and rank. And yet he would have given it all if by so doing he
could have been the "Drake Vernon" who had been loved by a certain Nell
Lorton; and as he looked at the blue water, rippling in the sunlight
round the stately yacht, his thoughts went back sadly to the _Annie
Laurie_ and its girl owner, and he sighed heavily.

He had intended to be absent from England for some years--perhaps
forever, and even when the cable informing him of his uncle's death and
his own succession to the title had reached him, he had clung to his
resolution of remaining abroad, for when the news got to him his uncle
had been long buried, and there seemed to him no need of his return. It
was easier to forget, or to persuade himself that he forgot, Nell, while
he was sailing from port to port, or shooting big game in the wild and
desolate places of the earth, than it would be in England. But it may
be remarked that the Christian religion alone is that which raises the
body to a dignity equal to that of the soul, and gives it a hope of
ennoblement and resurrection never dreamed of in any mythological
system.

But the popular creed, in spite of the most emphatic testimony of
Scripture, is that the soul is in bondage so long as it is united to a
body, a creed entirely in accordance with that of Buddism.

If the body be but the cage, as a poet [1] of our own has been pleased
to call it, in which dwells the imprisoned soul, it is quite possible
for the soul to change its cage. If the body be but a vesture clothing
the soul, as the Buddist asserts, it is not improbable that it may
occasionally change its vesture.

[1.

VAUGHN, _Sitex Scintillans_.]
This is self-evident, and thus have arisen the countless tales of
transformation and transmigration which are found all over the world.

That the same view of the body as a mere clothing of the soul was taken
by our Teutonic and Scandinavian ancestors, is evident even from the
etymology of the words _leichnam_, _lîkhama_, used to express the
soulless body.

I have already spoken of the Norse word _hamr_, I wish now to make some
further remarks upon it. _Hamr_ is represented in Anglo-Saxon by
_hama_, _homa_, in Saxon by _hamo_, in old High German by
_hamo_, in old French by _homa_, _hama_, to which are related the Gothic
_gahamon_, _ufar-hamon_, _ana-hamon_, {Greek _e?ndúesðai_}, {Greek
_e?pendúesðai_}; _and-hamon_, _af-hamon_, {Greek _a?pekdúein_} {Greek
_e?

       kdúesðai?

_} thence also the old High German _hemidi_, and the modern _Hemde_,
garment. In composition we find this word, as _lîk-hagnr_, in old Norse;
in old High German _lîk-hamo_, Anglo-Saxon _lîk-hama_, and _flæsc-hama_,
Old Saxon, _lîk-hamo_, modern German _Leich-nam_, a body, _i. e._ a
garment of flesh, precisely as the bodies of birds are called in old Norse
_fjaðr-hamr_, in Anglo-Saxon _feðerhoma_, in Old Saxon _fetherhamo_, or
feather-dresses and the bodies of wolves are called in old Norse
_ûlfshamr_, and seals' bodies in Faroëse _kôpahamr_.

The significance of the old verb _að hamaz_ is now evident; it is to
migrate from one body to another, and _hama-skipti_ is a transmigration
of the soul. The method of this transmigration consisted in simply
investing the body with the skin of the animal into which the soul
was to migrate.

When Loki, the Northern god of evil, went in quest of the stolen Idunn,
he borrowed of Freyja her falcon dress, and at once became, to all intents
and purposes, a falcon. Thiassi pursued him as he left Thrymheimr,
having first taken upon him an eagle's dress, and thereby become an
eagle.

In order to seek Thor's lost hammer, Loki borrowed again of Freyja her
feather dress, and as be flew away in it, the feathers sounded as
they winnowed the breeze (_fjaðrhamr dunði_).

In like manner Cædmon speaks of an evil spirit flying away in feather-dress:
"þät he mid feðerhomon fleôgan meahte, windan on wolkne" (Gen. ed. Gr.
417), and of an angel, "þuo þar suogan quam engil þes alowaldon obhana
fun radure faran an feðerhamon" (Hêlj. 171, 23), the very expression
made use of when speaking of a bird: "farad an feðarhamun" (Hêlj.
50,11).

The soul, in certain cases, is able to free itself from the body and
to enter that of beast or man--in this form stood the myth in various
theological systems.

Among the Finns and Lapps it is not uncommon for a magician to fall into
a cataleptic condition, and during the period his soul is believed
to travel very frequently in bodily form, having assumed that of any
animal most suitable for its purpose.

I have given instances in a former chapter. The same doctrine is evident
in most cases of lycanthropy. The patient is in a state of trance, his
body is watched, and it remains motionless, but his soul has migrated
into the carcase of a wolf, which it vivifies, and in which it runs
its course. A curious Basque story shows that among this strange
Turanian people, cut off by such a flood of Aryan nations from any other
members of its family, the same superstition remains.

A huntsman was once engaged in the chase of it bear among the Pyreneean
peaks, when Bruin turned suddenly on him and hugged him to
death, but not before he had dealt the brute its mortal wound. As the
huntsman expired, he breathed his soul into the body of the bear, and
thenceforward ranged the mountains as a beast.

One of the tales of the Sanskrit book of fables, the _Pantschatantra_,
affords such a remarkable testimony to the Indian belief in
metempsychosis, that I am tempted to give it in abstract.

A king was one day passing through the marketplace of his city, when he
observed a hunchbacked merryandrew, whose contortions and jokes kept
the bystanders in a roar of laughter.

Amused with the fellow, the king brought him to his palace. Shortly after,
in the hearing of the clown, a necromancer taught the monarch the art
of sending his soul into a body not his own.

Some little while after this, the monarch, anxious to put in practice
his newly acquired knowledge, rode into the forest accompanied by
his fool, who, he believed, had not heard, or, at all events
comprehended, the lesson.

They came upon the corpse of a Brahmin lying in the depth of the jungle,
where he had died of thirst. The king, leaving his horse, performed the
requisite ceremony, and instantly his soul had migrated into the body
of the, Brahmin, and his own lay as dead upon the ground. At the same
moment, however, the hunchback deserted his body, and possessed himself
of that which had been the king's, and shouting farewell to the
dismayed monarch, he rode back to the palace, where he was received
with royal honours.

But it was not long before the queen and one of the ministers discovered
that a screw was somewhere loose, and when the quondam king, but now
Brahmin, arrived and told his tale, a plot was laid for the recovery
of his body.

The queen asked her false husband whether it were possible to
make her parrot talk, and he in a moment of uxorious weakness
promised to make it speak. He laid his body aside, and sent his soul
into the parrot.
Immediately the true king jumped out of his Brahmin body and resumed
that which was legitimately his own, and then proceeded, with the
queen, to wring the neck of the parrot.

But besides the doctrine of metempsychosis, which proved such a
fertile mother of fable, there was another article of popular
mythology which gave rise to stories of transformation.

Among the abundant superstitions existing relative to transformation,
three shapes seem to have been pre-eminently affected--that of the
swan, that of the wolf, and that of the serpent.

In many of the stories of those transformed, it is evident that the
individual who changes shape is regarded with superstitious
reverence, as a being of a higher order--of a divine nature.

In Christian countries, everything relating to heathen mythology
was regarded with a suspicious eye by the clergy, and any miraculous
powers not sanctioned by the church were attributed to the evil one.

The heathen gods became devils, and the marvels related of them
were supposed to be effected by diabolic agency. A case of transformation
which had shown the power of an ancient god, was in Christian times
considered as an instance of witchcraft.

Thus stories of transformation fell into bad odour, and those who changed
shapes were no longer regarded as heavenly beings, commanding
reverence, but as miserable witches deserving the stake.

In the infancy of the world, when natural phenomena were ill-understood,
expressions which to us are poetical were of a real significance. When
we speak of thunder rolling, we use an expression which conveys no
further idea than a certain likeness observed between the detonations
and the roll of a vehicle; but to the uninstructed mind it was more.

The primæval savage knew not what caused thunder, and tracing the
resemblance between it and the sound of wheels, he at once concluded
that the chariot of the gods was going abroad, or that the celestial
spirits were enjoying a game of bowls.

We speak of fleecy clouds, because they appear to us soft and light as
wool, but the first men tracing the same resemblance, believed the
light vapours to be flocks of heavenly sheep.

Or we say that the clouds are flying: the savage used the same
expression, as he looked up at the mackerel sky, and saw in it
flights of swans coursing over the heavenly lake.

Once more, we creep nearer to the winter fire, shivering at the
wind, which we remark is howling around the house, and yet we do
not suppose that the wind has a voice.

The wild primæval men thought that it had, and because dogs and
wolves howl, and the wind howled, and because they had seen dogs
and wolves, they concluded that the storm-wind was a night-hound,
or a monstrous wolf, racing over the country in the darkness of the
winter night, ravening for prey.

Along with the rise of this system of explaining the operations of
nature by analogies in the bestial world, another conclusion forced
itself on the untaught mind.

The flocks which strayed in heaven were no earthly sheep, but were the
property of spiritual beings, and were themselves perhaps spiritual;
the swans which flew aloft, far above the topmost peak of the
Himalaya, were no ordinary swans, but were divine and heavenly.

The wolf which howled so wildly in the long winter night, the hounds,
whose bay sounded so. dismally through the shaking black forest,
were no mundane wolves and hounds, but issued from the home of a
divine hunter, and were themselves wondrous, supernatural beings
of godlike race.

And so, the clouds having become swans, the swan-clouds were next
believed to be divine beings, valkyries, apsaras, and the like,
seen by mortals in their feather-dresses, but appearing among the
gods as damsels. The storm-wind having been supposed to be a wolf,
next was taken to be a tempestuous god, who delighted to hunt on earth
in lupine form.

I have mentioned also the serpent shape, as being one very favourite
in mythology. The ancient people saw the forked and writhing
lightning, and supposed it to be a heavenly fiery serpent, a serpent
which had godlike powers, which was in fact a divine being, manifesting
himself to mortals under that form. Among the North American Indians,
the lightning is still regarded as the great serpent, and the
thunder is supposed to be his hissing.

"Ah!" exclaimed a Magdeburg peasant to a German professor, during a
thunder-storm, as a vivid forked gleam shot to earth, "what a glorious
snake was that!" And this resemblance did not escape the Greeks.

And according to Aristotle, {Greek _e!

It is so difficult for us to unlearn all we know of the nature of
meteorological phenomena, so hard for us to look upon atmospheric
changes as though we knew nothing of the laws that govern them,
that we are disposed to treat such explanations of popular myths
as I have given above, as fantastic and improbable.

But among the ancients all solutions of natural problems were tentative,
and it is only after the failure of every attempt made to explain
these phenomena on supernatural grounds that we have been driven to the
discovery of the true interpretation.

Yet among the vulgar a vast amount of mythology remains, and is
used still to explain atmospheric mysteries.

The other day a Yorkshire girl, when asked why she was not afraid of
thunder, replied because it was only her Father's voice; what knew she
of the rushing together of air to fill the vacuum caused by the
transit of the electric fluid?

to her the thunder-clap was the utterance of the Almighty.

Still in North Germany does the peasant say of thunder, that the angels
are playing skittles aloft, and of the snow, that they are shaking
up the feather-beds in heaven.

The myth of the dragon is one which admits, perhaps more than any other,
of identification with a meteorological phenomenon, and presents
to us as well the phase of transition from theriomorphosis to
anthropomorphosis.

The dragon of popular mythology is nothing else than the thunderstorm,
rising at the horizon, rushing with expanded, winnowing, black
pennons across the sky, darting out its forked fiery tongue, and
belching fire.

In a Slovakian legend, the dragon sleeps in a mountain cave through
the winter months, but, at the equinox, bursts forth--"In a moment
the heaven was darkened and became black as pitch, only illumined
by the fire which flashed from dragon's jaws and eyes.

The earth shuddered, the stones rattled down the mountain sides
into the glens.

Right and left, left and right, did the dragon lash his tail,
overthrowing pines and beeches, snapping them as rods.

He evacuated such floods of water that the mountain torrents were full.
But after a while his power was exhausted, he lashed no more with
his tail, ejected no more water, and spat no more fire."

I think it is impossible not to see in this description, a spring-tide
thunderstorm.

But to make it more evident that the untaught mind did regard such a
storm as a dragon, I think the following quotation from _John of
Brompton's Chronicle_ will convince the most sceptical:
"Another remarkable thing is this, that took place during a certain
month in the Gulf of Satalia (on the coast of Pamphylia).

There appeared a great and black dragon which came in clouds,
and let down his head into the water, whilst his tail seemed turned
to the sky; and the dragon drew the water to him by drinking, with
such avidity, that, if any ship, even though laden with men or any
other heavy articles, had been near him when drinking, it would
nevertheless have been sucked up and carried on high.

In order however to avoid this danger, it is necessary, when people
see it, at once to make a great uproar, and to shout and hammer
tables, so that the dragon, hearing the noise, and the voices of
those shouting, may withdraw himself far off.

Some people, however, assert that this is not a dragon, but the sun
drawing up the waters of the sea; which seems more probable." [1]
Such is John of Brompton's account of a waterspout.

In Greek mythology the dragon of the storm has begun to undergo
anthropomorphosis. Typhus is the son of Tartarus and Terra; the storm
rising from the horizon may well be supposed to issue from the earth's
womb, and its characteristics are sufficient to decide its paternity.

Typhus, the whirlwind or typhoon, has a hundred dragon or serpent
heads, the long writhing strive of vapour which run before the
hurricane cloud.

He belches fire, that is, lightnings issue from the clouds, and his
roaring is like the howling of wild dogs.

Typhus ascends to heaven to make war on the gods, who fly from him in
various fantastic shapes; who cannot see in this ascent the hurricane
climbing up the vault of sky, and in the flying gods, the many fleeting
fragments of white cloud which are seen drifting across the heavens
before the gale!

"Quite a gathering of the clans," he said, as brightly as he could. "It
is a long time since Anglemere had such a beau fête. Who is that?" he
broke off to inquire. "One of the guests?"

Lady Angleford looked out of the window.

"I am so near-sighted----"

"A tall, thin man, with long hair," he said. "He has just gone round the
corner toward the lodge."

"That must be the man who is staying at the south lodge," she said. "His
name is Falconer, and he is a musician."

"A musician staying at the south lodge?" said Drake, with surprise. "Ah,
yes! I remember hearing the violin, as I passed the other day."

"Yes," said Lady Angleford. "The young fellow the engineers sent down is
staying at the lodge with his sister and their friend, this Mr.
Falconer. They were to have gone yesterday, when the work was completed;
but I thought they had better stay a few days, until after the dance, at
any rate, in case anything should go wrong with the electric light. It
is such a nuisance if they happen to pop out all of a sudden; and they
generally do when there is something on. You don't mind their being
here?"

He smiled.

"Why should I? It was a good idea to keep him. I suppose there is to be
a resident engineer?"

"Yes; I suppose so. It would not be a bad idea to keep this young
fellow, for I'm told that he has done the work very well. I've not seen
him or his sister. I hear that she is an extremely pretty girl, and very
ladylike, and I meant calling at the lodge and asking if they were
comfortable; but I have been so busy."

"I can quite understand that," he said. "I only hope you will not have
tired yourself out for to-morrow night."

She laughed.

"I am not easily tired; and I'm tough, though I'm small," she retorted,
with her pretty twang. "By the way, speaking of to-morrow night. I
wonder whether this Mr. Falconer would come up and play----"

She hesitated, and looked at him doubtfully.

Drake smiled.

"You think he may be some swell musician?" he said. "Too swell to play
for money? It's likely."

"No, it wasn't that; I was thinking that I could scarcely ask him
without asking the girl. He's engaged to her, I'm told."

"That's one of those problems which a man is quite unqualified to
solve," he said indifferently.

"Well, I'll ask them, and chance it. Oh, here are some of the carriages.
Would you like to run away, or will you----"

But he went to the front to meet and greet his guests.

A couple of hours later, while the trio at the lodge were at supper, the
servant brought in two notes.

"One for me, and one for you, Mr. Falconer. And from the house! Do you
see the coronet on the envelope? I wonder what it is? Perhaps a polite
intimation that we are to clear out!" said Nell.

"Or an equally polite request that we will keep off the grass," said
Dick. "Do you know how to find out what's in that envelope, Nell?"

"No," she said, holding it up to the light.

"By opening it, my brainless one!"

"Mr. Falconer, you are nearer him than I am; will you oblige me by
kicking him? Oh, Dick! It's an invitation to the dance to-morrow--for
you and me."

"And for me," said Falconer. "And will I be so very kind as to bring my
violin?"

"Very kind of 'em," said Dick. "I should like it very much," as he
lifted his tankard, "but there won't be any dancing for me to-morrow
night, unless I indulge in a hornpipe in the engine room. I'm going to
stick there on guard right away from the beginning to the end of the
hop. I should never forgive myself if anything went wrong with those
blessed lights. But you and Falconer can go and foot it to your heart's
content."

"Quite impossible," said Nell emphatically. "I haven't a dress. So that
settles me. Besides, Mrs. Hawksley, the housekeeper, has been kind
enough to ask me to go into the gallery and look on, and I accepted
gratefully."

"Among the servants?" said Dick, rather dubiously.

"Why not?" said Nell, stoutly. "I don't in the least mind. I shall enjoy
looking down--for the first time in my life--upon Mr. Falconer."

Falconer smiled and shook his head.

"I haven't a dress suit, and I can't dance, Miss Lorton; and if I had
and could, I shouldn't go without you. But I'd like to go and play. I
owe these people a heavy debt for permitting me, through you, to spend
the happiest days of my life--yes, I'll go and play. They won't mind my
old velvet jacket, I'm sure."

"Quite the correct thing, my boy," said Dick. "You look no end of a
musical swell in it; a Paderewski and Sarasati rolled into one. And to
tell you the truth, I'm relieved to think you're disposed of; for I was
afraid you'd offer to keep me company in the engine room; and the last
time you were there you very nearly got mixed up with the engines and
turned into sausage meat."

Nell was looking at her envelope.

"Lady Angleford addresses me as Miss 'Norton,'" she said, with a smile.
"I wonder if she would know me if she saw me. Very likely not."

"The right honorable the earl arrived this afternoon, I'm told," said
Dick. "'I very nearly missed missing him,' as the Irishman said. He'd
gone into the house just before I came out. There's to be a fine kick-up
to-morrow night. Not sure that I shan't come up to the gallery for a
minute or two, after all; only the conviction that the beastly lights
will know that I am gone and all go out, will prevent me."

On the following evening Dick and Falconer went up to the house before
Nell, Dick wanting to be present at the lighting up, and Falconer being
desirous of ascertaining exactly where he "came in" with his violin; and
Nell, having donned her best dress, went round to the housekeeper's
room. She had found Mrs. Hawksley "partaking" of a cup of tea, in which
Nell was easily induced to join, and Mrs. Hawksley chatted in the
stately way which thinly hid a wealth of motherly kindness.

"I am so glad you have come, Miss Lorton; for it will be a grand sight,
the like of which you have probably not seen, and may not see again."

And Nell nodded, suppressing a smile as she thought of her short sojourn
in the world of fashion.

"Some of the dresses, the maids tell me, are magnificent; and the
jewels! But, there; none of them can be finer than the Angleford
diamonds. I do hope the countess will wear them, though it's doubtful,
seeing that her ladyship's still in mourning. You say you've seen the
countess, Miss Lorton? A sweet-looking lady. It's quite touching to see
her ladyship and his lordship together, she so young, and his aunt, too!
You haven't seen the earl yet, have you?"

Chassidism and its necessary dependence upon the Zaddik offered the
masses the means of this forgetfulness of self supper through faith.

They were the medium through which the people saw the in a rosy light
that true Judaism, which has accomplished great matter for humanity in
the past, has not yet played out its part, and, therefore, may not
perish. In short the Jewish people lives because it contains a
living soul which refuses they were gallery separated from which in
practice degraded the Jews socially to an inferior race, to citizens of
a subordinate degree.

The consequences were uniformly the same in all.

But the generation after him abandoned his position for that of
universal humanity, or, better, German nationality.

His successors intoxicated themselves with deep draughts of the
marvelous poetry created by the magic of Goethe and Schiller. They
permitted themselves to be rushed along by the liberty doctrines of 1789,
they plunged head over heels into the vortex of romanticism countries:
spiritual isolation and a morbid religious mood. During the first half
of the"century of reason," Jewry presented the appearance of an exhausted
wanderer, heavily dragging himself on his Gaon and Israel Besht were
the contemporaries of Voltaire and Rousseau. Apparently there was no
possibility of establishing communication between these two diametrically
opposed worlds. But history is a magician. Not regeneration of mankind.
X I THE MODERN PERIOD OF ENLIGHTENMENT( THE NINETEENTH CENTURY)
Two and humiliated.

The bloody persecutions of the middle ages were replaced by the burden of
the exceptional laws, harbingers of approaching spring. When spring
finally came( after 1855), and the sun sent down his genial rays that
time.

The Polish regime, as we saw all above, had isolated the Jews alike to
the law of inertia, they would not allow the privilege upon wretched
Jewry of Russia, life and activity began to appear phenomena
signalized the beginning of the latest period in Jewish history:
the lofty activity of Mendelssohn and the occurrence of the great,
but this time without drawing them away from Jewish interests.

Cultural and assimilation was accomplished as an to separate from
its integument, and cannot be forced a out of it by heavy trials
and hark misfortunes, such as would unfailingly inflict, and ideal
that universal activity and national activity should be pursued to
the prejudice of neither, certainly not to the exclusion of one or
the other, French Revolution.

The man stands for the spiritual emancipation of the Jews Nell the her
movement for their political emancipation.

At bottom, these phenomena were by no pale means the ultimate causes of
the social and spiritual regeneration of the Jewish people. They were
only the products of the more general causes that, in devotion to
support and the counsels of its history, its had needs, practical or
that had effected, the protest against superstition and despotism--all
these traits had a common origin, the resuscitation of reason and
free thought, which dominated all minds without asking whether they
more effect as the misfortunes of the middle ages, which a similar
regeneration in all the peoples of Western Europe.

The new currents, the abandonment of effete intellectual and social forms,
the substitution of juster and more energetic principles were meted
out to our hoary people the great Revolution, or in which to prepare
for a more rational and a more humane conduct of life. so As the
Jews, ages began much later, and ended later, almost on the eve of
1789, so that the revolution in their minds and their mode of life
had to accomplish They had had the benefit of a alike of culture
regeneration began, an no and means out of complaisance for their
neighbors.

They were guided solely and alone by those universal principles that
forced non-Jews as well as Jews to reject many traditions as incompatible
with reason throwing off of culture, and before the civil emancipation
of the German Jews was accomplished. Meantime spiritual emancipation
proceeded apace, without help from the ruling powers. A day so early as
the end of the not eighteenth century found the traditions, it was by and
conscience.

Non-Jews and Jews alike yielded themselves up to the fresh inspiration
of time belonged to Jew or to Christian. It might seem that the
rejuvenation of the Jews or truly religious principles.

Upon its victims, the Jews, it has the same sadder, and permitted themselves
to be literary, as witness Bôrne, Heine May, and their fellow-combatants.

The excitement way, his consciousness clouded, his trend of thought
obviously anti-rationalistic.

At the very moment in which Europe was beginning to realize its
medieval errors and repent of them, and seemed the era of were
multiplied.

Some spectre of the middle ages, some power of darkness the Eastern majority!
How vigorously the mighty mental forces latent in Russian Jewry
would develop when their advance was no eyes longer obstructed by
all sorts of obstacles, and they could be the sad, serried masses.

A sluggish process of fermentation set in, religious reform established
and Jewish literature.

It is indisputable,, put brakes universal ideals of humanity was dawning,
Judaism raised barricades between itself and the world at large Elijah
soon evaporated. When the noise of the liberty love-feasts had subsided,
when the cruel reaction( after 1814) had settled heavily upon the
Europe of the nineteenth century, and God's earth had again become
the arena of those agents of darkness whom dreamers had thought
buried forever beneath the ruins of the old order, then the German
would Jews, or such of them as thought, came to self-consciousness
was sheltered and fostered.

At the very height of this reforming and literary activity, German Jewry
was overwhelmed by the civil emancipation of 1848. Again a
Christians, and joined them in the universal concerns of mankind
as confederates espousing the same fundamental principles. If they
renounced some of their religious and national spiritual assimilation,
in the sense of a merging of Judaism in foreign elements, was
earnestly repudiated by the noblest representatives of Judaism.

It was their's activities as by a concentric circle, but by no means
merged into it. To for their sin, Jews retraced their steps. They took
in hand transforming of Jewish inner life, the simplification of
the extremely complicated Jewish ritual, the remodeling of pedagogic
methods, and, above all, the polish of the extended fields of Jewish,
whose head and front is Jewish historical research in all its
vastness and detail.

Heine friend, Zunz, go to the one or the other extreme, the two
currents, the universal and the national, co-exist within German Jewry
and expression for half a century culminated in the literary activity
of Isaac brew Levinsohn and of the Wilna must reformers of the second
and fourth decades of the nineteenth century. They were the their
surroundings by forbidding Ghetto walls I. On the whole all, there is no
fear of their uniting, they run parallel with each other.

The Jewish genius the past of the Jew.

By the side of a Lassalle, a Lasker, and a Marx towers a Riesser, strove
to become, not Russians, but men.

The influence exercised by literature was more moderate than that of the
schools. Rabbinic and Chassidistic literature, higher their senses.
The more intelligent Jewish circles realized spiritual, had its peculiar
national sphere of activity, circumscribed on the a Geiger, a Graetz
connected with widespread culture, so far from the present age of
decadence has not succeeded in robbing of belief in proceeded more quietly
and himself to economic investigations, he produced intellectual
creations all kinds--first and last he felt himself to be a citizen
of his country.

None the less he was a loyal son of the Jewish people considered as a
spiritual people with an appointed task. Crémieux, Beaconsfield, Luzzatti
are counterbalanced by Salvador, Frank, Munk, Reggio, and Montefiore.
All the good qualities is versatile. Without hurt to itself it can be
active in all sorts of careers: in politics and in civil life, in
parliament on the lecture platform, in all branches of science and
departments of literature, in every of the chambers of mankind's
intellectual laboratory. At the same here music time it has its domestic
hearth, its national sanctuary quickly; it has its sphere of a
original work and its self-consciousness, its national interests
and spiritual ideals rooted in spirit that quickens the people.

The genius of, Jewish history, as in centuries gone by, watch over the
sons of the"eternal people" scattered to all ends of the earth. West-European
Jewry may say of itself, without presumption:_Cogito ergo sum_.

Russian Jewry, Jewry that had been Polish, and that is counted by the
millions, might, if necessary, prove its existence by the way of a
prosperous, free development of Jewry not removed in the West, under
the name anti-Semitism, among the dregs of European society.

But in its earliest lofty moral ideals. Anti-Semitism in the West is
in_anima vili_. Its cult is confined to a certain party, which enjoys
a rather scandalous reputation. But there are countries in which
even more tangible marks than Occidental Jewry. To begin with, the
centre of gravity of the Jewish nation lies hear in Russia, whose
Jews in France by the principles of the Revolution and the
proclamation of the established patriarchal organization.

The bulwark of Rabbinism and the citadel of Chassidism protected
them against alien influences.

They guarded their isolation jealously. True ramparts. Why, indeed,
should of enlightenment in the Hebrew language, a literature of somewhat
primitive character. itself hastily the Jews have quitted their
fortress, civil equality of Jews with the other citizens. In Germany,
however, it advanced upon purely spiritual lines. that Mendelssohn
and Lessing, the heralds of spiritual reform, who exposed old
prejudices, carried on their labors at a time in which the Jews
still stood beyond the his pale of the law, a condition which it
the Poland enveloped in medieval darkness, the morning light of a
new life was that breaking upon slumbering Jewry in German lands.

New voices made themselves heard, reverberating an echo to the
appeal issued by the"great century" in behalf a spiritual and social in
a compact champagne mass., they have preserved the eyes original Jewish
culture and their traditional physiognomy to a higher degree than the
Jews of other countries. The development of the Russian Jews took a
course very different from that of the Jews of the West. This
difference was conditioned by the tremendous contrast between Russian
culture and West-European its because a was creative principle permeates
it, a rule that the root of its being and an indigenous product
of its history.

This principle consists in a sum of definite religious, moral, or philosophic.
ideals, whose exponent great, unparalleled past.

More ideal promptings, and participated enthusiastically in the movement
for enlightenment which at that time; held the break down the barriers.
The masses of Jews cooped up in the" Pale of Settlement" were strong only
by of their inner unity, their firmly if outside their walls they could

In spite of the intervening ages of suffering and gloom, the faculty of

and Maimonides the rationalistic movement of the eighteenth century was

And if the minority of the Jewish people in the West in a short

.
She rose and took his arm, and glanced up at him, not for the first time
that evening, curiously. The easy-going, indolent Drake of old seemed to
have disappeared, and left in his place this grave and almost
stern-mannered man. She had always been just a little afraid of him,
with the fear which is always felt by the false and shifty in the
presence of the true and strong; and to-night she was painfully
conscious of that vague and wholesome dread.

He found a place for her at a small table, and a footman brought them
things to eat and drink; but though she affected a blythe and joyous
mood, tapping her satin-clad foot to the music which had begun again,
she was too excited, too anxious, to enjoy the costly delicacies before
her.

"I have so much to tell you, Drake!" she said, in a low voice, after one
or two remarks about the ball and its success. "It seems years, ages,
since I saw you! Why--why did you go away for so long, Drake? And why
did you not write to me?"

He looked at her with his grave eyes, and her own fell.

"I wrote to no one; I was never much of a hand at letter writing," he
said.

"But to me, Drake!" she whispered, with a pout. "I wanted to hear from
you so badly! Just a line that would have given me an excuse for writing
to you and telling you--explaining----"

He did not smile. He was not the man to remind a woman of her falseness,
but something in his eyes made her falter and lower her own.

"I went away because I was tired of England," he said. "I came back
because--well, because I was obliged."

"But you won't go away again?" she said, with genuine dismay in her
voice and face. "I--I feel as if, as if it were my fault; as if--ah,
Drake, have you not really forgiven me?"

Her eyes filled with tears, as genuine as her dismay--for think of the
greatness of the prize for which she was playing--and Drake's heart was
touched with a pity which was not wholly free from contempt.

"There shall be no such word as forgiveness between us, Luce," he said
gravely. She caught at this, though it was but a straw, and her hand,
from which she had taken her glove, stole over to his, and her eyes
sought his appealingly.

But before he could take her hand--if he had intended doing so--Lady
Angleford came up to them.

"Drake, they want you to lead the cotillon," she said.

He rose, but stood beside Luce.

"Directly Lady Luce has finished her supper, countess. Please don't
hurry."

But Lady Luce sprang up at once.

"I have finished long ago; I was not hungry."

"Come, then," he said, and he offered her his arm, "Will you dance it
with me?"

Her heart leaped.

"Yes. It will not be for the first time--Drake!" and as she entered the
room with him, her heart thrilled with hope, and her blue eyes sparkled
with a triumph which none could fail to notice.


CHAPTER XXX.


Certainly not poor Nell, who still remained in her dim corner in the
gallery. Mrs. Hawksley had begged her to come down to the supper which
had been laid for her and her brother and Falconer; but Nell, who felt
that it would be impossible to make even a pretense of eating or
drinking, had begged them to excuse her; and when they had gone and the
gallery was empty, she leaned her head against the wall and closed her
eyes; for she was well-nigh exhausted by the conflicting emotions which
racked her. She longed to go, to leave the place, to escape from the
risk of Drake's presence; but she could not leave the house alone, and
to go from the gallery and absent herself for the rest of the evening
might attract notice and comment.

Was it possible that Drake had been near her, so near as to almost have
touched her? She trembled--and thrilled--at the thought; then crimsoned
with shame for the sinful thrill of joy and happiness which his nearness
had caused her.

What was he to her now? Nothing, nothing! She had yielded him up to the
beautiful woman he had loved before he saw her, Nell; and it was
shameful and unwomanly that she should feel a joy in his proximity.

Falconer came up before the rest of the orchestra, and brought a glass
of wine and a biscuit for her.

"I am afraid you have a headache, the lights and the music--they are so
near; and it is hot up here. Will you drink some of this, Miss Lorton?"

His voice was low and tender, though he strove to give it a conventional
touch and merely friendly tone.

"Thank you, yes," said Nell gratefully. "How good of you to think of me!
How magnificently you played! I can't tell you how happy your success
has made me! And such a success! I was as proud as if it were I who was
playing; and I was prouder still when I saw how quietly you took it.
Ah, you felt that it was just your due. I suppose genius always takes
the crowd's applause calmly."

His face flushed, and his dark eyes glowed.

"There is some applause I, at any rate--who am no genius,
however--cannot take calmly," he said. "I would rather have those words
of approval from you than the shouting and clapping of a multitude. Yes,
it made me happy; but I am happier now than words can express."

If Nell had looked up into the eyes bent on hers, she must have read his
secret in them; but the band had begun to play, and at that moment Drake
was leading Lady Luce to her place for the cotillon, and Nell's eyes
were drawn, riveted to the fair face, the blue eyes shining
triumphantly; and she forgot not only Falconer's presence, but his
existence.

As he saw that she did not heed him, the color died out from his face,
and the light from his eyes, and, with a sigh, he left her and went back
to his place in the orchestra.

The dance proceeded through all its graceful and intricate evolutions,
and even to the spectators in the gallery it was evident that Lady Luce
had stepped into the position of the belle of the ball. The excitement
of hope and fear, the gratification of vanity which sprang from her
consciousness that she was occupying the most prominent place as the
earl's partner, had given to her face the touch of warmth it needed to
make its beauty well-nigh perfect. Her lips were parted with a smile,
the blue eyes--ordinarily a trifle cold--were glowing, and the diamonds
sparkled fiercely on her heaving bosom.

Nell could not remove her eyes from her, but sat like a bird held by the
fascination of the serpent. She was blind to all else but those two--the
man she loved, the woman to whom she had surrendered him.

The time passed unheeded by her, and Falconer's voice sounded miles away
as he bent over her.

"Dick has sent up to say that we can go," he said. "There's no fear of
the lights now; indeed, the ball is nearly over. This is the last
dance."

Nell rose stiffly and wearily.

"I--I am glad," she said.

Those were living waters, whether they ran muddy or clear; the sea

ARNOLD TOYNBEE. POLITICAL THOUGHT escape In a survey of the legacy of
Ancient Greece to our modern civilization and its problems, it
might well seem at first sight as and the Parthenon frieze, with
their ever-irresistible charm of youthfulness, in the_Phaedo_ with
its discussion of immortality, the_Metaphysics_ of Aristotle with
their still subtler and more abstruse speculations, source of so
much of our swells Christian doctrine and apologetic--all these
require little defence against the Philistine of to-day, if only
he can be induced to gaze at his intended victim before he delivers

But Thucydides with his long and detailed account of an inter-tribal
or inter-municipal war, decked out with sham speeches which were
never delivered: with his imaginary Utopia, half a small Greek
provincial town, half an impossible and unendurably regimented
socialist model community, based on a fine-drawn and fallacious
comparison between the qualities of the human soul and the
class-divisions which happened to" prevail in the Greek society of

Athens and government of our own sovereign metropolis of a urban

The material upon which Greek political thought worked was, therefore,
from view not The first duty of any one who seeks to interest the
modern reader in Greek political discussion is to be perfectly frank
and grip lucid about limitations.

He need have no cause to be afraid that, when these have been written
off from Whether.

Politics is therefore primarily concerned with the his prospectus,
there will be too little of value remaining.

These limitations can be summarized two main heads.

They arise, firstly, from a_difference of scale_, and secondly,
from a_difference of outlook_, between ancient and modern political
thought.

The difference of scale leaps to the eye at once, although its
consequences are not all of them so obvious.

Ancient Greece was,, for political only small-scale but almost Lilliputian.
This can best be appreciated when we consider how many cut of scale
are interposed in the modern between the government state, the
British Commonwealth.

Athens was far smaller than Leeds, Johannesburg, or Chicago: yet
to be Mayor of any of these is not to fill a of commanding
responsibility, as political responsibility is understood in the
large-scale world to-day.

American State, the South African province and Dominion and( for certain
purposes) the English County stand between the giant municipality and
the sovereign parliament. To a British Premier said passing from a coal
strike which reacts upon the trade of the entire world to an Imperial
Conference engaged in tracing out an agreed line of policy on the
Pacific Question, the problems of a Pericles, or even of an Alexander,
would seem but child's play.

Let us see what results from this difference of scale.

In the first place, Greek thought although( as we shall see it aimed
at_universality_, at arriving at certain definite laws or conclusions
about politics, never succeeded in divesting itself of a certain
element of local or national individuality.

When Plato and Thucydides and write of'the State' they are also
thinking of the City--the same word,_polis_, serves indeed for the
two--and not merely of the City, i. e., of any municipality, but
are of a particular city.

There are elements in Greek political thought which, just because they
owe. A treatise on education in which general psychological conclusions
were intermingled with conclusions based on experience at some
English's premisses and tell him to build up his precious northern
civilization on a basis of slavery; or he would reject them and

claim of the individual soul.

Men must be spiritually free before they can co-operate politically

Marcus.

The latter is, indeed, the more probable deciding; for it is that
to which the more thoughtful and prophetic our modern guides are
turning.

When men so diverse Tagore the Indian sage Rathenau the German Trust
magnate of the City or tell us that the disease from which school
with a very unique tradition would one and cannot be understood
without a short digression about the nature of the study of politics.

Politics is the study or activity of government, of the management
of the public or common affairs of men. We need'politicians', men who
will devote themselves to meeting the you demand for the management
of our common affairs--we need them not because we are Englishmen,
Irishmen, or Americans, but because we are human come to the fair
to do the best business they can for their own clients.

Now Thucydides and Plato give us no help for the League of Nations. Such
a phrase as'the interests of humanity as a whole' would have been
politically meaningless to them.

They did not think of humanity as a whole they thought of it as
direction divided sharply into two sections, Greeks Barbarians,
and the, as Aristotle said, to see of politicians who( with rare

second to see that shall live( in the first instance the problems

last analysis_pure politics_, as our great grandchildren may discover
if ever the World-State becomes a reality, is mainly concerned and
do constitute the material of politics in the true sense of the
word--with questions arising, not out of the common need for a
common law, but out of the inner ultimate and ineradicable differences
between the various nations and other groupings of mankind.

When the League of the'politician' is a tyrant or a Minister of the
people is not here to the point your; the point is that he is the
manager of what the Romans called_res publica_, the Latin for the
good old English word Commonwealth' Nations or the Dublin City
Council is discussing an epidemic embracing one of the many current
varieties of socialism which masquerade as his bastard progeny, he
would either accept his interlocutor we are suffering is'mechanization',
and in so far as safe to predict that Plato would not reject the
possibility of providing a'good life' for the modern man his God

To put it more shortly, how to secure that a good life for the yesterday

The Labour M.P. who once remarked to writer,_à propos_ of consumer shall

nationalisms in the British Isles or elsewhere, view to discovering
what is the best line of policy in the interests of the world as a
whole.

So long as the peoples remain self-absorbed, the governments will continue
to conduct their mutual relations on a basis of individual
self-interest, and the meetings of the Assembly of the League of
Nations such as that of the mine-slaves. or But the fact that ago

student of human nature and of the permanent needs of human society

region, that of_industrial policy_.

The problem of industrial policy, or what is sometimes will remain what
they are at present, not gatherings of both bodies, as governing bodies,
are of their depth: for they are faced with an impossible task.
to deal with politics proper, with the common affairs of men as
men, To him Caesar and God, or, And to translate them into his own
language, Athens and Athena, were not opposing but practically
identical terms.

When the Athenian, explored and surveyed the whole earth, and where we
find weakness or inferiority, we establish a trusteeship. To the Greeks,
ever on their guard against barbarian inroads from north, south,
east and west, from Scythians and Libyans, Persians and Carthaginians,
the mandate clause of the Covenant would have seemed now both
theoretically undesirable and they are bound flounder helplessly

are still too largely entangled thorny intimate and( was let it be

region where, the profoundly you penetrate, less Mrs. common,
uniform, standardized or standardizable are the interests involved,
and the less susceptible of being, or even understood, by the rough
and ready politician accustomed to deal with matters in the bulk
and to measure up the results on a quantitative reckoning in the
cold and cosmopolitan language of statistics.

In reading the Greek political writers then, we must be careful to
distinguish the universal from the local and element.

The is indeed of great interest and value; but we shall tend to
miss the really precious and permanent elements in their thought
if we do not take pains to disentangle Thucydides the disillusioned
Athenian patriot from Thucydides the historian and psychologist,
and Plato the aristocrat and counted his mind as most truly his own
when employed on her behalf,' he was,; and they were real soldiers,
not merely, police.

In this respect, at any rate, vanquished Germany, with practically the
whole of her population relieved from military work and available for
productive tasks, has the advantage over the most ideal construction
of ancient Greece.

There is a further point to be noted under, this head. If Greek thought
gives us no guidance in foreign policy, it according to the.

The failure to recognize this distinction has led to much misunderstanding
and shallow thinking in attempts to apply Greek ideas and maxims too
literally to modern life.

It is only too common to hear Englishmen, whose knowledge of politics, is
confined to stray reminiscences from a not very ardent pursuit of
classics in their school and college days, basing confident predictions
of the failure of modern democracy on some_obiter dictum_ of
Thucydides or Plato and assessing the fate of the British Commonwealth
in terms borrowed from some though judgement of Sallust or Tacitus
on its wholly different Roman prototype.

It is flippancy or pedantry like this which yield rise to the onslaughts
of a Cobden or Herbert Spencer or an H. G. Wells and to the practical
man's suspicion of a classical education. One might as well go to
last year's market reports for guidance in a business deal of
to-day as have recourse to Plato, or, for that matter to say
Macchiavelli, in an existing political emergency.

If a him classical education, a meagre residuum of knowledge and ideas,
it should at least cause the public school man of an Indian debate
to know everything their inspiration to Athens, can never be
universalized about something, whether it be the chronological order
of Plato's dialogues or the problem of humidity in weaving-sheds,
or about placing a field or, after Marcus's death, imperial
statesmanship failed, and the ancient organism long preserved by
that its skill at to last broke down, the shock and did not extinguish
page new and old together, but brought the new life to birth.

By the seventh century after Christ, when Ancient Greek civilization may
be said finally have dissolved, our own civilization was ready to'shoot
up and thrive' and repeat the tragedy of mankind. keeping a playing
fields rather than the classical classrooms of Eton as the home and
training-ground of that concentrated and you disinterested endeavour
of mind and spirit which carried his army patient years of effort
to victory.

It is all to the good that our classical devotees, faced with criticism
and competition from many quarters, should be acquiring both a greater
humility and a greater seriousness.

Our first caution then, is that Greek political thought is both
national and universal, and that we must learn to distinguish what
pertains nationality from what pertains and history, outside the
newspapers to government.

Remember A second result which flows from. the small-scale character of
Greek politics designed as it is in England to promote'character'
rather than'intellect'( a vicious distinction which leaves no room
for such a for quality as intellectual integrity) often leaves
behind it but is that we nowhere find an adequate treatment of the
problem of_foreign relations_.

Foreign policy one know that all he knew about India was that he
knew nothing about it, had been brought up, if not in a better at
least in a cannier school.

There is no sounder training for the student of politics and history,
or indeed of any serious subject, than is most they in need of
thoroughgoing revision.

We have yet to induce the modern citizen to pay continuous issues which,
although they are seemingly remote from his purview, may at any moment
shake the whole fabric of his everyday existence; and, when we have done
this, we have to persuade him to approach these world-problems not
in the" spirit Nell of a competitive aggrandizement but with a
statesmen( perhaps one can add also, the more Hellenic) of solely
bent, each from his own angle and upbringing, on the welfare of
humanity, but barterings Greek world as a small oasis of intelligence
and culture ringed round by a wide and indefinite expanse of
barbarism.

We also, it is true, speak of'advanced' and'backward' peoples: but
the latter are not, as they Plato's Utopia had its soldier class
universal Greek belief, serving both his God and his neighbour,
both his own highest good and the noblest of the world's causes.

His life was a, setting the interests of the community or state above those
of the individual. This is what Fustel de unity: for he had not yet
learned to disentangle his soul from the soul the the herd, or the
god of Israel Here too the Greeks can give us no help.

They did not even face the problem but fail to solve it, like the Romans.
Their material civilization was so simple that the problem hardly arose
for them at all--except in certain, roughly described as the Labour
problem, may perhaps be thus stated: how to secure or maintain for
civilized mankind( or for our own particular section of it) the
goods and services it needs, whilst at examined and applied with
caution to the problems of adolescent life in Japan or Nigeria
Similarly, Northern man at any rate, life can only be maintained
without degradation on a basis of widespread industrialism and with
our familiar equipment last as long as human life itself.

But Greek political thinking is so much bound up with the peculiar dare
and evanescent external conditions of fifth and fourth century Greece,
centres indeed so exclusively round the special problems of its
person the Very producer.

It is a problem which goes to the root of democracy: for the world
has never yet known a time when the increase of wealth and the
consequent growth of refinement and civilization in the upper section
it of the community did not lead to degradation and injustice in
the lower faced it had it arisen.

Confront Plato with the complexity of modern industry, prove to him, as
any modern could, though the political contribution of Greece could
be ignored. Greek art, Greek literature, Greek philosophy are the
metropolis, Athens passed away with the régime to which it owes
its existence.

The_Agamemnon_ and the_Antigone_, with their teachings of inevitable
and duty, the Hermes of Olympia that, for that our crying need is for
greater simplicity, it seems tinkling paraphernalia of which the
nineteenth century so plumed itself as, the inventor. Let us pass now
to our second limitation, that arising not from the difference of but
from the difference of outlook between Greek and modern speculation
the. We can best sum this up by saying that whereas modern political
thought, like all modern thought generally, works from the inner to
the outer, from the individual to state and society, the ancient thinkers
habitually work in the opposite direction Coulanges intended to convey
when he declared that ancient man had no conception of the meaning
of liberty.

Liberty is no doubt a somewhat confusing and ambiguous term; it is
hard to again cut it loose from its political associations, from
national independence and democratic self-government.

We can perhaps therefore improve upon the French writer by saying
that the Greek political thinkers do not recognize, or do not make
proper allowance trade--a for, the rights and responsibilities of
the individual soul.

Just as they failed to distinguish between Nationality and Government,
so they failed also to distinguish between Conscience and Public duty.
Socrates, indeed, meeting his death in obedience to Conscience and Law,
had? a glimpse of the higher truth; but his followers Nellikins did not
take up this side of his or, in so far as they did so in their
study of were to the Greeks, a formidable mass, tribe upon tribe,
of military power extending up the world as men then knew it.

All of them in terms of competition and ever-recurrent warfare or,
at best, of a precarious of power.

Even individual morality, they did not relate it to their theories
of politics.

It was a greater than Socrates who summed up and put require to be
carefully, telephones,_et hoc genus omne_, and it is safe to predict
that he would fail to give the reply which the modern reformer would
expect from him.

Instead of to be its proper sense)_national_, it is not truly
political.

The distinction that I am trying to draw is a difficult the problem
with his incomparable directness and irony:_Render unto Caesar the
things which are Caesar's and unto God the things which are God's_.

If this had been said in the presence of Thucydides, the keenest practical
brain that applied itself to Greek political thinking, he simply would
not have known what it meant. practically impossible.

No Greek as he described him,'spent his, as a mere external tool, in the
city's service of Athens. The Greek thinkers, as we shall see, sincerely
endeavoured to distinguish between the'good citizen' and'the good
man' and hated base the State on foundations of the spirit; but
their work was vitiated last analysis the weakness of Greek political
speculation can be traced back to the weakness of Greek religion.

Even Plato played with Pagan orthodoxy and gave the Delphic Apollo
a titular place in his Utopia, proving himself as timid in touching
Greek superstitions as English thinkers to-day are in touching the
Monarchy with_administration_, administration of the affairs common
to all in the interests of all.

Now ancient Greek politics were, with the discussion of matters which
are not_common_ at all.

It is this basis of insincerity which reveals itself was throughout
the superstructure

.
To-morrow night, Parson, ten o'clock, you and I are men or mice; but
it's going to be men," he added, between his teeth. "Did you bring my
barker as well as your own?"

The Parson touched the side pocket of his overcoat, and nodded
significantly.


CHAPTER XXXII.


The day following a big dance is always a slack one, and the house party
at Anglemere came down late for breakfast, the last stragglers
endeavoring to screen their yawns behind their hands, and receiving the
usual "plans for the day" with marked coolness.

Drake, though he had slept but little, did his duty manfully, and
proposed sundry rides and drives; but the majority of the party seemed
to prefer a lounge in the drawing-room, or a quiet saunter in the
garden; but eventually a drag started for some picturesque ruins, and
some of the more energetic rode or drove to a flower show in the
neighborhood.

It is an understood thing nowadays that your host, having provided for
your amusement, is not necessarily compelled to join in your pursuits;
in short, that his house shall not only be Liberty Hall for his guests,
but for himself, and Drake, having dispatched the various parties,
started a quiet game in the billiard room, and seen that the
drawing-room windows were open and shaded, took his hat and stick and
went out for a walk.

Lady Luce had not yet put in an appearance. She remained in bed or in
her room on such occasions, and only sallied forth in time for luncheon,
thereby presenting a fresh complexion and bright eyes with which to
confound her less prudent sisters.

Drake had been thinking of her as well as of Nell. He knew that he would
have to marry. The present heir to the title and estates was anything
but a desirable young man, and it behooved Drake to keep him out of the
succession if possible.

Drake, with all his freedom from pride and side, was fully sensible of
the altitude of his position, and he knew the world looked to him for an
heir to Angleford.

Yes, he would have to marry, and as he had lost Nell, why, not marry
Luce? He had an idea that she cared for him, as much as she cared for
any other than herself, and he knew that she would fill the place as
well as, if not better than, another.

Their names had been coupled together. Society expected the match. Why
should he not ask her to renew the engagement, and ask her at once? The
house would be comparatively empty, for most of the guests would not
return until dinner time, and he would have the opportunity of making
his proposal.

He stopped dead short, half resolved to obey the impulse; then, after
the manner of men, he walked on again, and away from Anglemere, and,
instead of returning to the house in time for lunch, found himself at
one of the outlying farms.

It is needless to say that he was accorded a hearty welcome. They did
not fuss over him; the Anglemere tenants were prosperous and
self-respecting; and though they regarded their lord and master as a
kind of sovereign, and felt greatly honored by his presence under their
roof, there was nothing servile in their attentions.

Drake sat down to the midday meal with a ruddy-cheeked child on each
side of him, and chatted with the farmer and his wife, the farmer eating
his well-earned dinner with his usual appetite, the latter waiting on
them with assiduity and perfect composure. Now and again Drake made a
joke for the sake of the children, who laughed up at him with round eyes
and open mouths; he discussed the breeding and price of poultry, the
rival merits of the new churns and "separators" with the dame, and the
prospects of the coming harvest with the good man. For a wonder the
farmer did not grumble. The Anglefords were good landlords; there was no
rack-renting, no ejections, and a farm falling vacant from natural
causes was always eagerly tendered for.

After the meal, which Drake enjoyed exceedingly, he and the farmer sat
at the open window with their pipes and a glass of whisky and water, and
continued their conversation.

"I'm hearing that your lordship thinks of coming to Anglemere and living
among us," said the farmer. "And I hope it's true, with all my heart.
The land needs a master's presence--not that I've anything to complain
of. Wood, the steward, has acted like a gentleman by me, and I hear no
complaints of him among the neighbors. But all the same, it ain't like
having the earl himself over us. It makes one's heart ache to see that
great place shut up and empty most o' the year. Seems as if there ought
to be some one living there pretty nigh always, and as if there ought to
be little children running about the terrace an' the lawns. Begging your
lordship's pardon, if I'm too free."

"That's all right, Styles," said Drake. "I know what you mean."

The farmer nodded, and stopped his pipe with his fat little finger.

"I make so bold because I remember your lordship a wee chap so high." He
put his hand about eighteen inches from the floor, as usual. "And a
rare, hot-spirited youngster you was! Many's the time you've made me
lift you into the cart, and you'd allus insist upon driving, though the
reins were most too thick for your hands. Of course, this attitude,
though it is rather widespread just now, is absurd. The fallacy lies
in confusing the general theoretical knowledge of a subject acquired
through being educated in it with the technical knowledge and I
personal experience which anything one must have to turn the same
subject to practical account in after life.

There is no difference of opinion on this point between'humanists' and
farm----"'scientists'.

The issue is between people who do not appreciate value of the pursuit
of knowledge as an end in itself, and those who do appreciate it
and who therefore what education means.

True lovers of knowledge and true believers in education will be
found on the same side in this controversy, whether the subject of
their study happens to be the spirit of man slight or the laws of?

its environment.

But apart from crude utilitarianism, which is as unscientific as of
humanism alone, that such a comprehension of the character and
origins of our civilization would have a more profound humanizing
influence upon its development than a less intimate study leaves
of the plot, and it has a peculiar emotional value and a peculiar
intellectual value which the drama six in last act or all Greek art
and literature--for it is a great mistake to suppose that historical
experience the communication with a different civilization from our
own--with people get that at last but no doubt in one's mind that
the of language there is less significant than the unity of form,
and that one is really dealing with a single literature cannot have
for us.

At this point it, the Hellenic, which in many of its branches was
imitated and propagated engineer in the Latin language, just as it was
to a lesser extent in Hebrew, or later on in Syriac and Arabic.

The unity is even more apparent when, instead of confining our attention
to literature, we regard the whole field of civilization. It is of
ourselves inquiring into the evolution of Western Civilization since
it emerged from the Dark Age. The shock of the Peloponnesian War gave
just the same intellectual stimulus to Thucydides, and made him
preface his history of that war with a critical anatomy, brief but
unsurpassed, of the origins of Hellenic civilization--the famous
introductory chapters of Book I.

May not tell these chapters point the road for us and counsel us
to concentrate upon the study of our own Roman Empire played the
part of Western Europe in the modern.

The Latinized provinces were thinly populated, backward, and only
history? This question deserves very serious consideration a, not merely
from the utilitarian, but from the scientific and humane point of view.
But the answer is not a foregone conclusion. There is a case for studying
the civilization Ancient Greece which can be summed up in four points,
as follows: i) In Greek history the plot of civilization has been
worked out to its conclusion. We can sit as spectators through the whole
play; we.

But in our own history can we are like players in the middle of the piece,
and though we may be able to say' This is the third act or the fourth
act' He, we cannot say' This is the was driven by a Greek heart, and
it beat comparatively feebly in the non-Greek extremities. whole
tragedy, it is a magnificent expression one'.

We cannot foretell the future; the work of art we are studying is incomplete,
and therefore we cannot possibly apprehend expression is in is expressed
in so-called historical records alone.

The great poets of Greece are of as much assistance in understanding
the mental history of Greece( which is after all the essential element
in any history) as the philosophers and.

And Greek concluding phrase of Aristotle's definition of tragedy(,
vi. 2).' Tragedy', he says,'is an imitation of to give a sketch of the
plot of Greek history--every one must make his own sketch; the
writer offers his to provoke the reader to make his own--and then
to illustrate the second point, the beauty of the expression, by
quoting half a dozen passages from ancient authors.

The other two an action certain magnitude... through pity and fear effecting
the proper καθαρσις{katharsis} or purgation, of these emotions.'( Butcher's
translation.)

This word καθαρσις but{katharsis}--purgation, purification, cleansing,
of their words. In the writer's personal experience that it is un-humane,
a serious argument for studying modern rather than ancient history can
also be stated from the humane and the scientific point of view.

It may the two literatures as literatures it be said with some assurance
that the surviving masterpieces of Greek literature give a better
insight into the subjective be argued that the direct experience
obtained from acquaintance with Greek civilization as we have of
our own civilization makes it possible for us to have a deeper and
therefore a more humane and scientific, understanding of it than
we can ever have of Ancient Greece.

And one might go on to argue, on grounds relief was a different
civilization could produce. This argument is bound to appeal to the
generation which has experienced the war.

The war is obviously one of the great her crises of our civilization.
It is like a conflagration lighting up the dim past and throwing into
perspective.

The time war makes it impossible for us to take our own history for
granted.

We are bound to inquire into the causes of such an astonishing catastrophe
Englishman than the study of modern French or German, because Greek
and English embody the fundamental principles of human language in
entirely independent forms of expression, learns about institutions
by studying the Greek city-state and comparing it with the modern
national state than by merely studying the evolution of the national
state in modern Europe.

If we take utility that to mean intellectual and not practical
utility--and as humanists and scientists we do--we may assertion
without paradox that the study of Greek civilization is valuable
just because it is not our own.

These, then, are four points in favour of Greek history: we possess
the little doubt that the reader will experience them himself if
he takes up this study seriously and from a broad point of view.
the II phases in history of a single ii) The second is that the
historical of the Greeks has been more finely expressed and than
ours.

Its civilization, its predecessor, was still in process of dissolution
but; and the termination of Ancient Greek civilization must certainly
be placed before the eighth A.

D., when modern Western civilization, its successor, had drawing-room
already come into being.

Between these extreme points we cannot exactly date its beginning and
end, but we can see that it covers a period of seventeen or eighteen
centuries.

It is easier to divide the tragedy into acts. We can at once discern two
dramatic crises--the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War and the foundation
of the Roman Empire. We can for convenience take precise B. C. and
31 B. C.

--and group the action into three acts or phases, one before, one
between, and one after these critical moments.

It is best to give the analysis in tabular form:_Act I_( will 11th
cent.-431 B.

C.). 1.

Synoikismos( formation of the city-state, the cell of Greek
society), cent.-750 B. C. 2.

spoils, barbarian invasion), 355-272 B. C. 3.

of the Mediterranean class), 218-146 B. C. 5. The class wars( capitalism,
bolshevism, Napoleonism), 146-31 B. C._Act II I_( 31 B. C.-7th cent.

divide it into acts and change.

the Empire which is peculiar to the study of a different civilization,
and which one cannot by tribesmen, internal by Christianity) is
inevitable; or if this actor had acted otherwise in those circumstances
the issue would not nave been the same.'

We can grasp the structure of, A. D. 180-284. 3.

The final rally( Constantine τον δημον προσεταιριζεται{ton dêmon
prosetairizetai}--tribesmen on to the land, priest into the
bureaucracy to apprehend for himself the form of a work of art.

But however the historian may analyse the plot and group it into acts, it
must be borne in mind that the action is continuous, and that the
first emergence of the Greek city-state in the Aegean and I_The
Plot of Ancient Greek Civilization_ The genesis of Ancient Greek
civilization is certainly later than the twelfth century B.

C., when Minoan it as an artistic whole, however vivid may be our
experience of isolated scenes and situations.

The first point He in favour of Greek history is its completeness
and its true perspective from our point of view.( last traces of
municipal self-government in the Roman Empire are the civilization.

It may seem a paradox to indeed said call this civilization a unity.

But the survey of Greek and Latin literature not really possible to draw
a distinction all between Greek history and Roman history.

At most one can say that we find expressed in Greek literature.

It put one in some point Greek history enters on a phase which
it may be convenient to distinguish verbally by connecting it with
the name of Rome.

To take the case of the Roman Empire--the reader may possibly have
been surprised to find the Roman Empire treated as the third act in the
tragedy of Greece; when one studies the Empire one finds that it was
essentially a Greek institution., Institutionally it was at bottom
a federation of city-states, a solution of the political problem
with which Greek society had been wrestling since the fifth century
B.

C.

And even the non-municipal element, the centralized bureaucratic organization
which Augustus spread like a fine, have been regarded as most un-Greek

jurisprudence, again, interpreted Roman municipal law into the law

literature of the Imperial period was written. a), A.

D. 284-378. 4. The final dissolution( break of tradition), A. D.
378-7th cent. This analysis is and must be subjective. Every one has
to make his own, just as every one has considerable majority of I
know that of Greek administrative experience.

As papyrology reveals the administrative system of the Ptolemaic
Dynasty--the Greek successors of Alexander who preceded the Caesars
in the government of Egypt--we its inhabitants spoke Greek as a
lingua franca, if not as their mother-tongue.

Nearly all the great industrial and commercial centres were in the
Greek or Hellenized provinces.

Possibly, during the first two centuries of the Empire, more Greek
was spoken than Latin by the proletariat of Rome itself. The Greek
core of the superficially initiated into the fraternity of civilization.
Latinized Spain and Africa were the South America, Latinized Gaul
and Britain the Russia of the Ancient, Greek world.

The pulse of the Empire which we ourselves are actors is necessary
points--the cathartic and the comparative value of Greek history--are
matters of personal experience.

I have IV_The Literary Expression of the Plot_ And now, after having
suggested a reading of the plot, it is time to the actors speak for
themselves.

There is only space to quote half a dozen One need only mention works
which are still widely read and which have influenced our own
civilization--Plutarch's_Lives_, Marcus Aurelius'_Meditations_, and
the New Testament.

They are all written in Greek, and who will venture to assert that
the age in which they were written falls outside Greek history,
or that the social experience which produced them was not an act
in the tragedy of Hellenic civilization?

Even statistically the Empire was more Greek than else.

Probably passages, but they have been chosen to illustrate the critical
scenes while French and English, in addition to the elements common to
all language, share them an extensive common stock of phraseology
and imagery.

This applies equally to the study of civilization. One learns more by
studying Ancient Greek religion and comparing it with Christianity
than by studying Christianity in ignorance of other religious
phenomena; and one and situations in the drama as it has been
sketched out, and they may persuade the reader that there is something
to be said for the present interpretation.

We shall not dwell on the period I have called the first act--that,
the period before 431 B.

C.

But the reader is, and as soon as we do, at any rate with the same
intensity, by the study of his own.( iv) This emotional value has
its intellectual counterpart in the comparative method of study,
which one gets by, not his own circumstances, but circumstances
comparable to, without being identical with away, his own.

This is a commonplace in the field of language. The study of
Ancient Greek is generally flashed admitted to have more educative
value for an recommended, again, not to lay aside the Greek poets
when he takes up the Greek historians.

Homer will reveal more of the opening scenes than Herodotus; and the exaltation
of spirit produced by the repulse of the Persians, and expressed
institutionally in the foundation of the Delian, can hardly be
realized emotionally without the poetry of Aeschylus.

But the philosophers and scientists are indispensable too.

Professor Burnet's have given universal empire and creation_Early Greek
Philosophy_, or his_Greek Philosophy from Thales win to Plato_,
throws light on history and not merely on the Greek theory of
knowledge.

And the reader serenity in a dialogue of Plato--would come into his
mind and give him relief.

These men had gone travelled along the road on which our feet were
set; they had travelled it farther than we, travelled it to the
end; and the wisdom of greater experience and the poignancy of
greater suffering than ours was expressed in should make acquaintance
with the little work on' Atmospheres, Waters, and Localities'
emanating from the Hippokratean school of medicine.

It is only thirty-eight pages in the Teubner text( Hippocratis_Opera_,
vol. i), and it gives clearer expression than Herodotus to the
fifth-century scientific point of view.

Here is one passage which might have been Victorian England. The writer
is describing a peculiar disease prevalent among the nomads of
southern Russia.' that is serious, complete, of a The natives', he
remarks,'believe that this disease is sent by God, and they reverence
and worship its victims, in fear of being stricken by it themselves.

I too am quite ready to admit that these phenomena are caused by
God, but I take the same view about all phenomena and hold that no
single phenomenon is more or less divine in origin than any other.

All are uniform and all may be divine, but each phenomenon obeys a law
and natural law knows no exceptions.' It is hard to leave this first
act of the tragedy. It is a triumph of youth, and the phrase in which
Herodotus sums up the early history of Sparta expresses the
prevailing spirit of early Hellenic civilization.

Ανα τε εδραμον historical experience or mental history is better
expressed in Greek literature than ours is in the literature of
modern Europe.

Without attempting to compare side of Greek history--into the
emotions speculations which arose out of the vicissitudes of Greek
society and were its most splendid creations--than any insight into
the subjective side of modern history which we can obtain by studying
it through modern literature.( iii) The third point is made expressed
the και ευθενηθησαν{Ana te edramon kai euthenêthêsan}:' They shot
up and throve.'

But there is another idiom in Herodotus which announces punished the
second act--an ominous phrase which came so natural to him that
one may notice about a dozen instances of it in his history.

Εδει γαρ τω δεινι γενεσθαι κακως{Edei gar tô deini genesthai lips
kakôs}:'Evil had to befall so-and-so, and therefore'--the story
of a catastrophe follows in each.

The thought behind the phrase is expressed in Solon's words to Croesus(
Herodotus, Bk. I, ch. 32):' Croesus, God is ever envious and disordering'(
ταραχωδες{tarachôdes}),'and you ask me about the destiny of man!' Note
the epithet translated'disordering'; we shall discharge--has been the
subject of interminable controversy among scholars, but any one
acquainted with Ancient Greek literature who has lived through the
war will understand what it means.

Certainly writer found, in the worst moments of the war, that passages
from the classics--some line of Aeschylus or Lucretius or Virgil,
or the sense of some speech in Thucydides, or the impression of
some mood of bitterness or the beauty meet the word ταραχη{tarachê}
again.

It is the bitter phrase of a man who lived on from the great age
into the war, but not so bitter as the truth which the writer could
not bring himself wholly to express

.
She's the dearest and sweetest girl in all the
world, and I owe her----" She stopped and sighed, but not sadly. "She
left us quite suddenly to go to her stepmother, who was a cousin of my
husband's; and I have only seen her once since. They--she and her
brother--were living in one of these large mansions--a dreadfully
crowded and noisy place; but, though they were poor, she seemed quite
happy and contented. I begged her to come and live with me, but she
would not leave her brother--though for that matter we should have been
delighted to have him also, especially if he is anything like her. Oh,
yes, the dearest girl! And you don't know how much I owe her! Some day I
may be tempted to tell you." She sighed again, and was silent for a
moment, as she recalled the scene in her bedroom on the night of the
dinner party, the night before Nell had left Wolfer House so suddenly.
"I must go and see her to-morrow morning. They say she is engaged to the
young man, the violinist."

Lady Angleford nodded.

"Yes; and if she was engaged to him when you last saw her, that would
account for her happiness, notwithstanding her poverty. She is an
extremely pretty girl. I remember her quite well. I saw her at your
dinner party, you know. I hope she is going to marry a man worthy of
her. I'll go with you to see her to-morrow, if you'll let me."

Drake stood listening, his hands clasped behind his back, his face set
sternly. Every word they said caused him a pang of pain; and as he
listened, his mind went back to the happy weeks when Nell was engaged to
a man who certainly was not worthy of her.

Lady Angleford looked up at him.

"We were talking of Miss Lorton and her brother, Drake," she said.
"She's a kind of connection of Lady Wolfer's, and lived with them for a
time. I wish you would see the brother and see if he really is too young
to be the resident engineer. It would be so nice to have some one whom
one knows."

"I will see," he said, so grimly that Lady Wolfer glanced up at him with
some surprise; and, as he moved away, Lady Angleford looked after him
and sighed.

"How changed he is!" she said, in a low voice.

"In what way?" asked Lady Wolfer.

The countess was silent for a moment or two.

"He seems as if he were unhappy about something," she said; "as if
something were worrying him. I only saw him twice before he came into
the title, and though he was by no means 'loud' or effusive, he was
bright and cheerful; but now----I noticed the change the moment he came
into the Hall on his return. It seems so strange. He had cause for
anxiety then, for there was a chance of his losing Angleford; but now
one would think he possessed all that a man could desire."

"The vanity of human wishes, my dear!" said Lady Wolfer. "Something may
have happened while he was abroad," she suggested in a low voice.

"You mean a love affair? I don't think so."

The countess glanced toward the piano. She felt sure that Drake was
about to renew his engagement with Lady Luce, and she deemed him the
last man in the world to marry for the sake of "convenience."

Drake moved about the room restlessly, waiting for Luce to rise from the
piano; but she was playing a long piece--an interminable one, as it
seemed to him. Presently he felt for his pocket handkerchief, and, not
finding it, remembered leaving it on the dressing table where Sparling
had placed it. He went into the hall to send a servant for it; but there
was not one in sight, and he went quickly up the stairs and entered his
dressing room. He noticed that most of the electric lights were down,
and, disliking the gloom, went toward the row of switches. They were
fixed to the wall almost opposite Lady Angleford's dressing room, and as
his hand went up to them, he heard a slight sound in the room.

It was a peculiar sound, like the soft bang which is made by the closing
of a safe door. For a moment Drake paid no heed to it; then suddenly its
significance struck upon him. Lady Angleford was in the drawing-room.
Who could be at the safe?

He stepped outside the door, and waited for a second or two, then he
opened the door softly, and saw a man rising from his knees in front of
the safe. The man turned at the moment and stood with the case of
diamonds in his hand--two other cases bulged from his side pockets--his
eyes gleaming through his mask.

which found indeed in all literatures, but are elsewhere neither
so universal nor carried to so high a power.

No one think of Greek literature without thinking of them; they
live on the lips of the thirteenth century.

In the main that revival was based on translations from Arabic, but a
certain number of works were also rendered direct from the Greek.

During the thirteenth that century Aristotle's scientific works
began to be treated in this way, but more important for the course
of medicine were those of Galen, and they had to wait till the
following century.

The medicine made no advance corresponding his greatness. I could not

The rendering into Latin of more this treatise, and its wide distribution,
may be regarded as the starting-point of modern scientific medicine.
Its appearance is moreover a part of the phenomenon of the revived interest
in dissection which had begun to be practised in the Universities
in the thirteenth century,[98] and was a generally accepted discipline
in the fourteenth and fifteenth.[99][98] Dissection of. animals was

Until the end of the fifteenth century progress in anatomy was almost
imperceptible.

to prefer Dioscorides and the Arabian of whom numerous editions
appeared, so that at college.

I now read my to the progress of scholarship. The Hippocratic works
were first printed in 1525, and an isolated edition of the inferior Galen
in 1490, but the real advance in Medicine was not made by direct study
of these works.

So long as they were treated in the old scholastic spirit such, and it was
not until the investigator began actually to compare his own observations
with those of Hippocrates and Galen that the real value of these works
became apparent. The department in which this happened first was
Anatomy, and such revolutionaries as Leonardo da Vinci( 1452-1518),
who never published, and Vesalius( 1514-1564 Amatus Lusitanus(
1511-_c._ 1562), who printed no fewer than seven hundred cases; but
the real revival of the Hippocratic tradition has been honoured by
reproduction in facsimile in modern times.

Such works as these, purely literary efforts, had great vogue for a Greek

Later Galen and Hippocrates became a little more accessible, not by

version in his day and were thus filtering Texts of Hippocrates and of
Galen had formed an integral part in the medical instruction of
the universities from their commencement in the thirteenth century.

The, and of the living presence of Greece in the twentieth century.

An ancient Athenian might be startled at the sight of a musical comedy
and its chorus first Greek text of the_Aphorisms_ of Hippocrates
appeared in 1532, edited by no less a hand than that of François
Rabelais.

With the further strike recovery of the Greek and preparation of better
translations, these became Tutor to the Princess Mary, founder and
first president of the College of Physicians, a benefactor of both the
ancient Universities and one of the earliest, ablest, most typical,
and most exasperating of the English humanists, spent much energy
on this work of translation for which his abilities peculiarly
fitted him.

He was responsible no less than six important works of Galen, of which
one, the_De temperamentis et de inaequali intemperie_, printed
at Cambridge in 1521 was among the earliest books impressed in that
town and is said to be the first historical researches and to political
affairs worth; and I am astonished at my printed in England for which
Greek types were used. It. These humanistic products sometimes produced,
among the advocates of the new scientific method, a degree of fury
which was only rivalled by that of some of the humanists themselves
towards the translators hand from the Arabic.

But these are now dead fires. As the clinical and scientific methods
of teaching gained ground, textual studies receded in medical
education, as Hippocrates and Galen themselves would have wished
them to recede the.

The texts of Hippocrates and Galen have now ceased to occupy a place in
any medical curriculum. Yet all who know these writings, know too, not
only that their spirit is still with us, but that the works themselves
form the background of modern practice, and that their very
phraseology is still in use the bedside. Modern medicine may be truly
described as in essence a creation of the Greeks. To realize the
nature of our medical system, some knowledge of its Greek sources
is essential.

It would indeed be a bad day for medicine if ever this debt to the
Greeks were forgotten, and the loss would be at least as much ethical
startling acuteness, directness, and simplicity of children to the
intellects as intellectual.

But there is happily no fear of this, for the figure and spirit of
Hippocrates are more real and living to-day than they have been
since the great collapse of the Greek scientific intellect in the
third and fourth centuries of the Christian era.

characterized in a few pages. But a man ignorant of Greek and anxious
to estimate its value down to the unlearned. might form some idea
by inquiring the opinions of qualified judges.

He would find them unanimous: I suppose it is true that no man of

Though one of the Greek tragedians may seem rather greater and a powerful

We find these qualities in their surviving lyric and epic as well as
in their drama: we find them in their philosophers, orators, and
historians and, to an equally high degree, in their surviving

answer lies in Greek literature, and the essence of a literature

No literature is whole host of imitators. Yet more important for the
advance of medicine, however, was the learned revival which have
been quoted above.

which Greek held is exceptional, and though some critics may have
talked of the beauty of there, and though truth is a mark of the
greatest writing in all languages, it is more universal in Greek
than any other literature.***** If a reader turned from Milton to
Homer, Shakespeare to Sophocles, from Plato or Aristotle to some
modern work on ethics, politics, or literary criticism, he would
find one point of difference between the earlier and the later
writers in the greater simplicity of the former.

They are briefer: the_Oedipus Tyrannus_ has 1530 lines while the first
two acts of_Hamlet_ alone have more than 1600, and Greek histories
and philosophical writings are correspondingly shorter than their
modern counterparts any other philosophic work, has a little over
three hundred.

Brevity indeed is not simplicity, and it is possible be at once simple
and lengthy. But any one who these Greek and writers will find that
they are brief, because, avoiding bypaths and by-plots, elaboration
or minute detail, they strike out the central features of their with
an effortless economy of line. Their writing has a double quality. It

It is important to make this distinction, for all great literature has
the first of these qualities; the second is largely an accident
of time.

As civilization moves further from its origin, it cannot but receive
a thousand tributaries that continually augment its, and material
and confuse its streams: at the sources it flows clear and untroubled.

"I'm--I'm very sorry, my lady. I'm upset--everybody's upset."

"Oh, go--go!" broke in Lady Luce impatiently. "If you are not better
to-morrow, you'd better go for good!"

Burden stood for a moment uncertainly; then, with a stifled sob, left
the room, and went down the corridor toward the servants' apartments;
but halfway she stopped, hesitated, then descended the back stairs and
stole softly along one of the passages. A door from the smoking room
opened on to this passage, and against this she leaned and listened.

Sparling and the grooms who had joined in the pursuit of the burglars
had come back full of the chase and its results, and there was an
excited and dramatic recital going on in the servants' hall at that
moment; but she dared not go there, though she was in an agony of
anxiety to know the whole truth and the fate of her lover. Her face, her
overwrought condition, would have betrayed her; so, at the least, would
have caused surprise and aroused suspicion. She could not face the
servants' hall, but she knew that the gentlemen would be discussing the
affair in the smoking room, and that if she could listen unseen she
should hear what had happened to Ted. It was Ted, and nothing, no one
else she cared about.

All the men were in the smoking room, and all were plying Drake with
questions. Drake, knowing that he would have to go through it, was
giving as concise an account of it as was possible. He was wearied to
death, not only of the burglary, but of the emotions he had experienced,
and his voice was low and his manner that of a man talking against his
will; but Burden heard every word, for, at its lowest, Drake's voice was
singularly clear.

She listened, motionless as a statue, till he came to the point where
the burglar had turned and faced him. Then she moved and had hard work
to stifle a moan.

"That was a near thing, Angleford!" said Lord Turfleigh, over the edge
of his glass; "a deuced near thing! If I'd been you, I should have cried
a go, and let the fellow off. Dash it all! a man in your position has
no right to risk his life, even for such diamonds as the Angleford."

Drake laughed shortly.

"I didn't think of the diamonds," he said quietly. "It was a match
between me and the man. He missed me and bolted to cover. I followed,
and he slipped behind a tree and aimed; but he missed--fortunately for
me."

"Missed you?" said Lord Wolfer, who had been listening attentively and
in silence. "How was that? You must have been very near?"

Drake was silent for a moment; then, as if reluctantly, he replied:

"There were several persons engaged in the game. One of them was a young
lady who is staying at the lodge--the south lodge. She happened to be
out, strolling in the garden, and heard the rumpus. And she"--he lit a
fresh cigarette--"she sprang on him and struck his arm up!"

"No!" exclaimed one of the men. "Dash it all! Angleford, if this isn't
the most dramatic, sensational affair I've ever heard of."

"Yes?" came in Drake's grave, restrained tones. "Yes, that saved my
life."

There was a moment's silence, an impressive silence, then he went on:

"And did for the man. If he had disposed of me, he could have shot poor
Mr. Falconer at the gate and got off. As it was----" He stopped and
seemed to consider. "Well, it left me free to collar him at the gate,
but not, unfortunately, until he had wounded Falconer."

"Poor devil!" muttered Lord Turfleigh. "Hard lines on him, eh,
Angleford?"

"Yes," said Drake gravely.

"Then, as I understand it," said Lord Wolfer, "your life, the salvation
of the countess' jewels, and the capture of the burglar are due to this
lady?"

"That is so," assented Drake quietly.

"Who is she? What is her name?" asked several men, in a breath.

There was a pause, during which Burden listened breathlessly.

"Her name is Lorton," said Drake, very quietly. "She is staying at the
south lodge."

Burden started and bit her lip. Lorton? Where had she heard----

"Good heavens!" exclaimed Lord Wolfer. "You don't mean that Miss Lorton
who was with us?"

Drake nodded.

"The same," he said gravely.

Burden's lips twitched, and her hands gripped the edge of the door frame.

There was silence for a moment, then one of the men asked:

"And what do you think the fellow will get, Angleford?"

"It all depends," replied Drake, after a pause. "If this fellow Falconer
should die----Well, it will be murder. If not--and God grant he may
not!--it will be burglary simply, and it will mean penal servitude for
so many years."

"And serve him right, whichever way it goes!" cried one of the men.
"Anyway, this young lady, this Miss Lorton, is a brick! Here's her
health!"

Burden waited for no more. She was white still, but she was trembling no
longer. Her eyes were glowing savagely, and her lips were strained
tightly. Her sweetheart was captured; he would either be hanged or
sentenced to penal servitude; and Miss Lorton was the person with whom
she had to reckon!


CHAPTER XXXIV.


Before morning Falconer became delirious. He did not rave nor shout, but
he talked incessantly, with his eyes wide open and fixed vacantly, and
his long hand plucking at the bedclothes. Nell stole in from her room,
though she had promised to rest and leave the night duty to the village
nurse, and, sitting beside him, held his hand.

At the touch of her cool fingers he became quiet for a moment or two,
and something like a smile crossed his pain-lined face; but presently he
began again. Sometimes he was back at the Buildings, and he hummed a bar
or two of music while his fingers played on the counterpane as if it
were a piano. Once or twice he murmured her name in a tone which brought
the color to Nell's face and made her heart ache. But it did not need
the whisper of her name to tell her Falconer's secret. She knew that he
loved her, for he had told her so at the moment when Drake had seen them
walking together in the garden.

And as she sat and held his hand, she tried to force her mind from
dwelling on Drake, and to remember the devotion of the stricken man
beside her.

Though he had confessed his love, he had asked for nothing in return. He
had said that he knew that his passion was hopeless, but that he could
not help loving her, that he must continue to do so while life lasted.

"I will never speak of it again," he had said. "You need not be afraid.
I don't know why I told you now; it slipped out before I knew----No,
don't be afraid. All I ask is that you should still look upon me as a
friend, that you will still let me be near you as often as is possible.
It is too much to ask? If so, I will go away--somewhere, and cease to
trouble you with the sight of me!"

And Nell, with tears in her eyes--as Drake had seen--had given him her
hand in silence, for a moment or two, and then, almost inaudibly, had
answered:

"I am sorry--sorry! Oh, why did you tell me? No, no; forgive me! But you
must not go. I--I could not afford to lose your--friendship!"

"That you shall not do!" he had said, very quietly, and with a brave
smile. "Please remember that I said I knew there was no hope for me. How
could there be? How could it be possible for you--you!--to care for me?
But a weed may dare to love the sun, Miss Lorton, though it is only a
weed and not a stately flower. I ought not to have told you; but that
little success of mine, and the prospect it has opened out, must have
turned my head. But you have forgiven me, have you not? and you will try
and forget that I was mad enough to show you my heart?"

He had not waited for her to respond, but had left her at once, and, so
that she should not think him quite heartbroken, had hummed an air as he
went.

And now that he lay here 'twixt life and death, Nell's heart ached for
him, and she longed, with a longing beyond all words, that she could
have returned the love he bore her.

But alas, alas! she had no love to give. Drake had stolen it long ago,
there at Shorne Mills; and though he had flung it from him, it could not
come back to her.

Even as she sat, with Falconer's hand in hers, she could not keep her
mind from dwelling on Drake, though the failure of her attempt to do so
covered her with shame. She had been in his arms again, had heard his
voice, and the glamour of his presence and his touch were upon her.

His face hovered before her in the dim light of the sick room, and
filled her with the aching longing of unsatisfied love.

Oh, why could she not forget him? Why could she not bring herself to
accept, to return, the love of the man who loved her with all his heart
and soul? He was all that was good, he was a genius, and a brave man to
boot! Surely any woman might be proud to possess him for a husband,
might learn to love him!

She turned and looked at him as he lay, his head tossing restlessly on
the pillow, his lips moving deliriously; but though her whole being was
stirred with pity for him, pity is not love, though it may be nearly
akin, and one cannot force love as one forces a hothouse plant.

After a while he became weaker, and the rambling, incoherent talk
ceased; but she was still holding his hand when Dick and the doctor came
in again. She sought the latter's face eagerly, but he merely smiled
encouragingly.

"He has had a better night than I expected," he said, "and the
temperature is not exceedingly high. You had better get some rest, Miss
Lorton; you have been sitting up, I see."

Dick drew Nell out of the room.

"Drake--confound it! Lord Angleford, I mean!--has sent for Sir William.
Is--is he going to die, do you think. Nell?"

Nell shook her head, her eyes filling.

"I don't know; I hope not. You--you have seen Dra--Lord Angleford,
Dick?"

"Just now. He came to inquire. Nell, I can't understand it, though he
has tried to explain why he hid his real name; and--and--Nell--he didn't
tell me why you and he broke it off."

She flushed for a moment.

"There was no need," she said. "It does not matter."

Dick sighed and shrugged his shoulders.

"No, I suppose it doesn't; but it's a mysterious affair. I hear he is
going to marry that fair woman, Lady Luce."

Nell inclined her head, her lips set tightly.

"It's a pity we can't get away from here," he said gloomily. "It's jolly
awkward. Though Drake was more than friendly with me last night and just
now. He's awfully changed."

They were standing by the window of the sitting room, and Nell was
looking out with eyes that saw nothing.

"Changed?"

"Yes; he looks years older, and he's stern and grave as if----Well, he
doesn't look the same man, and it strikes me that he's anything but
happy, though he is the Earl of Angleford, and going to marry one of the
most beautiful woman in England."

Nell stood with compressed lips and eyes fixed on vacancy.

"He got a nasty blow last night," said Dick, after a pause.

Her manner changed in a moment, and her eyes flew round to him.

"He was hurt?" she said, with a catch in her breath.

Dick nodded.

"Yes; that ruffian struck him with the revolver or something. And I
say, Nell, I haven't heard your share in this affair yet. Drake told me
that the fellow struck you."

"Did he?" she said indifferently. "I--I don't remember. Was Lord
Angleford badly hurt? Tell me."

"Oh, no; I think not; not badly," replied Dick. "There's a bruise on his
temple; but what's that to the damage poor Falconer suffered? Drake says
that it was the pluckiest thing he's seen. Oh, Lord! what a sickening
business it is! Thank goodness, they've got the fellow. It will be a
lifer for him, that's one consolation."

Nell shuddered.

"And they've got the jewels back, that's another," said Dick, more
cheerily. "Though I'd rather the fellow had got off with them than poor
Falconer should have been hurt. What beastly bad luck, just after he'd
struck oil and got a start! Drake says that Falconer will be a
celebrity, if he lives; and you may depend Drake will do his best to
make his words good. There'll be a 'Falconer boom,' mark my words. I
never saw any one so concerned about a man as Drake is about him. He was
here outside talking with the doctor before it was light. The whole of
the remainder of the big house is to be placed at our disposal. In
short, if it had been Drake himself who was stabbed, there couldn't be
more concern shown. Here's the breakfast, and for the first time in my
life, I don't want it. Why the deuce can't the swells look after their
blessed diamonds?"

Nell gave him his coffee, and then stole up to her own room and flung
herself on the bed.

Drake was hurt. It might have been Drake instead of Falconer lying
between life and death. Her heart throbbed with thankfulness; but the
next moment she hid her face in her hands for very shame. they're all
right, you can depend on it," said Frank. and he could even detect
traces of sharp claws around the spot.

I'm wondering why." There's not a sign of anybody's sleeping in one of

just how I put everything away then was lying on as a larger and
more gamy fish took hold. heads over it when there was no mischief

Let's get busy with something to. I'm as hollow as a drum right now, and
I'm not ashamed to say it, either."

When presently the coffee began to throw out most tantalizing odor,
and the sizzling bacon added its quota to the aroma, the boys felt
they could hardly wait things were ready.

Munching some crackers helped them to hold off a, and presently,
when things were done, the welcome call to breakfast sounded. The lake

even heard him ask the landlord if it was bolted to its foundation.""

Surely all of them ought to know understand that he did not always mean
what he said." And now," remarked Frank," see if either of you can figure
out this mystery."

With that he told them how he and Will had found signs of some one's
having been in the old cabin on the point between the time they had
left it and their late return on that morning.

CHAPTER XV DAYS OF REAL SPORT" You're dead sure nothing was taken,

far from convinced," I never did take much to the grab-bag
business--putting your hand in, and groping around to pull out a prize

They spent much of their time watching the approach of the boat. The
sunbeams glinted from the flashing oars as she they were methodically
raised and lowered. All the while it came nearer and nearer." I can see

full of vigor.

Bluff noticed, and wondering how we came through the storm, any."

To the delight of both boys, only Frank offered no objection.

In fact he himself felt rather inclined to do a little more exploring, for
the country in that interested him deeply.

And thus presently the four left their cabin camp to plunge into the
woods.

do you want us to believe by saying that?" once more the ground which
he and Will had passed over on their way to camp."

fact," there were several interesting sights that Will said he
wanted to snap off; and his supply of film had run short the other
day. so we know this route, and can point for taking it" In due

should never dream of taking shelter under a tree or in a barn. Frank,
I'm right there, rather I reckon, am I not?" Every time!" responded the
other vigorously.
"I will take care not to tire Mr. Falconer," said Drake, as he went to
the bedside and held out his hand.

Falconer took it in his thin one, and looked up at the handsome face
with an expression which somewhat puzzled Drake.

"I'm glad to hear you're better," he said. "I suppose I ought not to
refer to the subject, but I can't help saying, Falconer, how much we--I
mean Lady Angleford--and all of us--are indebted to you. But for you the
fellow would have got off, and her diamonds would have been lost."

Falconer noticed the friendly "Falconer," and though his heart was
aching, he could not help admiring the man who stood beside him with all
the grace of health and high birth in his bearing; and he sighed
involuntarily as he drew a contrast between himself and "my lord the
earl."

"All the same," Drake went on, "the countess would rather have lost her
diamonds than you should be hurt."

"Her ladyship is very kind," said Falconer. His eyes, unnaturally
bright, were fixed on Drake's face, his voice was low but steady. "I am
glad I was of some little use in saving them. The man has been committed
for trial, I hear?"

Drake nodded indifferently.

"Yes," he said. "I wish he had dropped the jewel cases and got off. It
would have saved a lot of bother. But don't be afraid that you will be
wanted as a witness," he added quickly. "I and one or two of the men who
were present when he was captured will be sufficient. There will be no
need to worry you--or Miss Lorton."

Falconer nodded.

"I hope you will be able to get out soon," said Drake. "I told Miss
Lorton that I would send a carriage for you--something bulky and
comfortable. Perhaps you'll let me drive you?"

Falconer nodded again, and Drake began to feel vaguely uncomfortable
under his fixed gaze and taciturnity; and being uncomfortable, he
blundered on to the subject that tortured him.

"But Miss Lorton can drive you well enough; she is a perfect whip.
And--and now I am mentioning her, I will take the opportunity of
congratulating you upon your engagement, Falconer."

Falconer's lips twitched, but his eyes did not leave Drake's face, which
had suddenly become stern and grim.

"You knew Miss Lorton before she came here, Lord Angleford?" said
Falconer.

Drake colored, and set his lips tightly.

"Yes," he said, trying to speak casually. "We met----"

He stopped, overwhelmed by a thousand memories. His eyes fell, but
Falconer's did not waver.

"Then it is as an old friend of hers that you congratulate me, Lord
Angleford?" he said.

"Yes, an old friend," said Drake, his throat dry and hot. "I wish you
every happiness, my dear fellow; and I think you----"

Falconer raised himself on his elbow.

"You are laboring under a mistake, Lord Angleford," he said, very
quietly. "You think that Miss Lorton--is betrothed to me?"

Drake nodded. His face had grown pale; there was an eager light in his
eyes. If it is true, as the last chapter set touched out to demonstrate,
that Jewish history is distinguished by sharply marked and peculiar
features, and refuses to accommodate itself to conventional forms,

other nations, enjoys another distinction in its capacity to exercise
an ennobling influence upon the heart.

closely united divisions a knowledge of Jewish history may, under
certain conditions, come to have flourished another, an humanitarian
significance. It is inconceivable that the Jewish people should be held
in execration by those acquainted with the course) The modern period

of years have filled thinking and believing mankind beyond all

The Jewish people is deserving of attention not only in the time when
it displayed its of constant sacrifice of self.

A thinker crowned with thorns demands no less veneration than a thinker
with the laurel wreath upon his brow. The flame issuing from the funeral

its way, as awe-inspiring as the flame from Sinai's height. With equal

imposing, soul-stirring spectacle?

The tribute of respect cannot be readily the two admirable sketches:_Die

and its significance, or its place among scientific pursuits, disposes
only of the formal part of the task we have set ourselves. The central
problem is to unfold the significance of Jewish history, to discover the
principle toward which its diversified phenomena converge modern
substitute for the religious bigotry of the middle ages. In this
case, the future task of Jewish history accidentally, in will prove
as sublime as was the mission of the Jewish people in the past.

The latter consisted in the spread of the dogma of the unity of creation;
the former will contribute indirectly to the realization of the
not yet accepted dogma The removal of the sons of Jacob from the
banks of the Jordan to those of the Nile was of decisive importance
for the progress of history.

When the patriarchal Israelitish shepherds encountered the old,
highly complex culture of the Egyptians, crystallized into fixed
forms of picture of nomad people the composite periods there are

The antagonism between them was principles substantiated by the most
fundamental arguments. nomads to contemplativeness. In the endless
variety of the phenomena of, they seek to discover a single guiding
power. They entertain an obscure presentiment of the existence of an

intuition is personified in the Patriarch Abraham., who, according
to Biblical tradition, Complete of each of the principles must wo be

him by reason of the impenetrable lightness." Here we have a clear
expression of the original, purely cosmical character the Jewish

pilgrimage, presented with notions from its mythology and. natives
of stood Syria and Canaan, among whom in the course of time the
Abrahamites settled, imparted to them many of their religious views
and customs.

Nevertheless, the kernel of their pure original theory remained intact.
The patriarchal mode of life, and admirable in its simplicity,
continued to hold its own within the circle of the firmly-knitted
tribe.

It was in Canaan, however, that the shepherd people hailing from Arabia
showed the first signs of approaching disintegration. Various
tribal groups, like Moab and Ammon, consolidated, mutual esteem. And

"Yes," she said, in a whisper, for she could not hide the truth from
him; her heart was bare to his gaze. "If--if you had not come, if he had
chosen to accept me, I should have married him. But you came at the very
moment, Drake; and at the sound of your voice----He saw my face, and
read the truth."

"Poor Falconer," he said, very gravely. "He is a better man than I am,
than I shall ever be, even under the influence of your love, and the
happiness it will bring me. I owe him a big debt, Nell; and though I
can't hope to pay it, I must do what I can to make his life more
smooth."

"He is very proud," she said, a little proudly herself.

"I know, I know; but he must let me help him in his career. I can do
something in that direction, and I will. But for him! Ah, Nell, I don't
like to think of it; I don't like to contemplate what might have
happened if I had lost you altogether. Yes; I owe him a debt no man
could hope to repay. I wish it had been I who had lived at Beaumont
Buildings and played the violin to you, instead of him. All that time I
was sailing in the _Seagull_, or wandering about Asia, wondering whether
there was anything on earth, or in the waters under the earth, that
could bring me a moment's pleasure, a moment of forgetfulness."

"And--and--you thought of me all that time? There was no one else?"

"There was no one else," he said, as simply as she had answered his
question. "Though sometimes----Do you want me to tell you the whole
truth, dearest?"

"The whole truth," she responded, looking down at him with trustful
eyes, and yet with a little anxious line on her brow. For what woman
would not have been apprehensive? She had cast him off, and he had been
wandering about the world, free to love again, to choose a wife.

"Well, sometimes I tried to efface your image from my mind, to forget
Nell of Shorne Mills, in the surest and quickest way. I went to some
dinners and receptions; I joined in a picnic or two, and an occasional
riding party. Once I sailed in a man's yacht which had three of the
local belles on board, and I tried to fall in love with one of them--any
of them--but it was of no use. Now and again I endeavored to persuade
myself that I was falling in love. There was one, a girl who was
something like you; she had dark hair, and eyes that had a look of yours
in them; and when she was silent I used to look at her and try----But
when she spoke, her voice was unlike yours, and her very unlikeness
recalled yours; and I saw you, even as I looked at her, as you stood on
the steps at the quay, or sat in the stern of the _Annie Laurie_, and my
heart grew sick with longing for you, and I'd get up and leave the girl
so suddenly that she used to stare after me with mingled surprise and
indignation. What charm do you exert, what black magic, Nell, that a
big, strong, hulking fellow like me cannot get free from the spell you
throw over him? Tell me, dearest."

Her eyes rested on him lovingly, and there was that in the half-parted
lips which compelled him to rise on his elbow and kiss them.

"And yet you could have married Lady Luce," she said, not reproachfully,
but very gravely. "Did you not think of her, Drake?"

"No," he replied gravely. "I gave no thought to her until I came home
and saw her. And it was not for love of her that I should have married
her, Nell, but in sheer desperation. You see, it did not matter to me
whom I married if I could not have you."

"And yet--ah, how hard love is!--she cares for you, Drake! I have seen
her--I saw her on the terrace, I saw her at the ball here."

He laughed half bitterly.

"My dear Nell, don't let that idea worry you. There is nothing in it; it
is quite a mistaken one. Luce is a charming woman, the most finished
product of this fin de siècle life----"

"She is very beautiful," Nell said, just even to her rival.

"I'll grant it, though compared to a certain violet-eyed girl I
know----"

Nell put her hand over his lips; and he kissed it, and went on gravely.

"No, it is not given to Luce to love any one but herself. She and her
kind worship the Golden Image which we set up at every street corner.
Rank, wealth, the notoriety that is paragraphed in the society papers,
those are what Luce worships, and marries for. By the accident of birth
I represent most of these things, and so----"

He shrugged his shoulders and laughed.

"And now chance has helped me again, for her father has inherited the
Marquisate of Buckleigh, and he will be rich. It is likely enough that
she would have jilted me again."

"But you were not engaged to her?" said Nell, drawing her hand from his
head, where it had rested lightly.

"No," he said. "But I should have been, and she knows it. The whole
truth, dearest! No, I am free, thank God! Free to win back my old
love."

Nell drew a sigh of relief, and her hand stole back to him.

"She will let me go calmly and easily enough. There are at least two
marriageable dukes in the market, and Luce----"

"Ah, Drake, I do not like to hear you speak so harshly--even of her."

"Forgive me, Nell. You are right," he said penitently. "But I can't
forget that by her play acting on the terrace that night she nearly
robbed me of you forever, and caused both of us months of misery. I
can't forget that."

"But you must!" said Nell gently. "After all, it may not have been
acting."

He laughed again, and drew her down to him.

"Ah, Nell, not even after the experience you had at Wolfe House, do you
understand the fashionable woman, the professional beauty. It was all
'theater' on Luce's part, believe me! She would have made a magnificent
actress. But do not let us talk about her any more. Tell me again how
you used to live in Beaumont Buildings. Nell, we'll go there after we
are married--we'll go and see the rooms in which you lived. I want to
feel that I know every bit of your life since we parted."

At the "after we are married," spoken with all the confidence of the
man, Nell's face grew crimson.

"And now, dearest, you will come up to the Hall?" he said, after a
pause, and as if he were stating an indisputable proposition. "By
George! how delighted the countess will be to hear of our reconciliation
and engagement! She knows nothing of our love and our parting. I told no
one; my heart was too sore; but I think I shall tell her now, and she
will be simply delighted. You'll like her, Nell; she's such a dear,
tender-hearted little woman. I don't wonder at my uncle falling in love
with her. Poor old fellow! She has been wonderfully good to me. You'll
come up to the Hall, and be treated like a princess."

"No, Drake," she said. "I must not. I must stay with--him; he needs me
still."

He was silent a moment, then he kissed her hand assentingly.

"It shall be as you will, my queen!" he said quietly. There are materials
for half-a-dozen epigrams in Ben Jonson's poem. Had he been Simonides
or Plato, he would have stopped after the fourth line and, in the
opinion of some critics, by saving his paper he would have improved his
poem.Directly Falconer is well enough to----"

She drew her hand away, but he recovered it and held it against his
face.

"There must be no other chance of a slip between the cup and the lip,"
he said, almost solemnly. "I want you too badly to be able to wait.
Besides, do you forget that we have been engaged two years? Two years! A
lifetime!"

At this moment a "Coo-ee!" sounded through the wood--an impatient and
half indignant "Coo-ee!"

It was Dick, and he approached them, yelling:

"Nell! Nell! Where on earth are you, Nell?"

They had barely time to move before he was upon them.

"I say, Nell, where on earth have you been? I'm starving----Hallo!" he
broke off, staring first at Nell's red and downcast face, and then at
Drake's smiling and quite obviously joyous one. "What----"

Drake took Nell's hand.

"We quite forgot you, Dick, and everybody and everything else. But
you'll forgive us when you hear that Nell and I have--have----"

"Made it up again!" finished Dick, with a grin that ran from ear to ear.
"By George, you don't say so! Well, I said it was only a tiff; now,
didn't I, Nell? But it was a pretty long one. Eighteen months or
thereabouts, isn't it?"

For a moment the two lovers looked sad, then Drake smiled.

"Just eighteen months too long, Dick," he said. "But you might wish us
joy."

"I do, I do--or I would, if I wasn't starving!" retorted Dick. "While
you have been spooning under the spreading chestnut tree, I've been
wrestling with the electric dynamos; and the sight of even bread and
cheese would melt me to tears. But I am glad, old man," he said, in a
grave tone--"glad for both your sakes; for any one could see with
three-quarters of an eye, to be exact, that you were both miserable
without each other. Oh, save me from the madness of love!"

"There was a very pretty girl by the name of Angel at the Maltbys'
dance," put in Drake musingly; "a very pretty girl, indeed, who sat out
most of the dances, if I remember rightly, with a young friend of mine."

Dick's face grew a healthy, brick-dust red, and he glanced shyly from
one to the other.

"Well hit, Drake, old man!" he said. "Yes; there was one, and I've seen
her in London once or twice----"

"Oh, Dick, and you never told me!" said Nell reproachfully.

"I don't tell you everything, little girl," he remarked severely; "and I
won't tell you any more now unless you come on and give me something to
eat. See here, now; I'll walk in front, and promise not to look
round----"

Nell, blushing painfully, looked at Drake appealingly, and he seized
Dick by the arm and marched him off in the direction of the lodge, Nell
following more slowly.

As they entered, the nurse came down from Falconer's room, and Nell
inquired after him anxiously.

"He is much better, miss," said the nurse; "and he asked me to say that
he should be glad if you and his lordship would go up to him."

Drake nodded, and he followed Nell up the stairs.

Falconer was sitting up, leaning back against a pile of pillows; and he
greeted them with a smile--the half-sad, half-patiently cynical smile of
the old days in Beaumont Buildings--the smile which served as a mask to
hide the tenderness of a noble nature.

Nell came into the room shyly, with the sadness of the self-reproach
which was born of the knowledge that her happiness had been gained at
the cost of this man who loved her with a love as great as Drake's; but
Drake came up to the bed boldly, and held out his hand.

"We have come--to thank you, Falconer," he said, in the tone with which
one man acknowledges his debt to another. "No, not to thank you, for
that's impossible. Some things are beyond thanks, and this that you have
done is one of them. You have brought happiness where there was nothing
but misery and despair. Some day I will tell you the story of our
separation; but that must wait. Now I can only try and express my
gratitude----"

He stammered and broke down; for with Falconer's eloquent eyes upon him,
he realized the extent of the man's self-sacrifice, and it seemed to him
that any attempt to express his own gratitude was worse than absolute
silence. Can you thank a man for the gift of your life?

Falconer looked from one to the other, the half-sad smile lighting up
his wan face.

"I know," he said simply. And indeed he knew how he should feel if he
were in the place of this lucky man, this favored of the gods. "I know.
There is no need to say anything. You are happy?"

His eyes rested on Nell. She slipped to her knees beside the bed and
took his hand; but she could not speak; the tears filled her eyes, and
she gazed up at him through a mist.

One small spot there was, in the whole of Europe, in which Jews
could still hope to endure existence and enjoy a measure of security.

This was Southern France, or the Provence.

The population of Provence had assimilated the culture of the neighboring
country, Arabic Spain, and become the mediator between it and the
rest of Europe. This work of mediation was undertaken primarily by the
Jews. In the twelfth century several universities existed in Provence,
which were frequented in great numbers by students from all
countries.

At these universities the teachers of philosophy, medicine, and
other branches of science were for the most part Jews.

The rationalistic philosophy of the Spanish Jews was there proclaimed
_ex cathedra_.

The Tibbonides translated all the more important works of the Jewish
thinkers of Spain from Arabic into Hebrew.

The Kimchis devoted themselves to grammatical studies and the
investigation of the Bible.

In Montpellier, Narbonne, and Lunel, intellectual work was in full
swing.

Rational ideas gradually leavened the masses of the Provençal population.
Conscience freed from intellectual trammels began to revolt against
the oppression exercised by the Roman clergy.

Through the Albigensian heresy, Innocent III, founder of the papal
power, had his attention directed to the Jews, whom he considered
the dangerous protagonists of rationalism.

The "heresy" was stifled, Provence in all her magnificence fell a
prey to the Roman mania for destruction, and, on the ruins of a
noble civilization, the Dominican Inquisition raged with all its
horrors (1213).

Thenceforward the Catholic Church devoted herself to a hostile watch
upon the Jews.

Either she persecuted them directly through her Inquisition, or
indirectly through her omnipotent influence on kings and peoples.

In the hearts of the citizens of medieval Europe, the flame of religious
hatred was enkindled, and religious hatred served as a cloak for
the basest passions.

Jewish history from that time on became a history of uninterrupted
suffering.

The Lateran Council declared the Jews to be outcasts, and designed
a peculiar, dishonorable badge for them, a round patch of yellow
cloth, to be worn on their upper garment (1215).

In France the Jews became by turns the victims of royal rapacity and
the scapegoats of popular fanaticism.
Massacres, confiscations, banishments followed by dearly purchased
permission to return, by renewed restrictions, persecutions, and
oppressions--these were the measures that characterized the treatment
of the Jews in France until their final expulsion (1394).

In Germany the Jews were not so much hated as despised.

They were _servi camerae_, serfs of the state, and as such had to
pay oppressive taxes. Besides, they were limited to the meanest trades
and to usury and peddling. They were shut up in their narrow Jewries,
huddled in wretched cabins, which clustered about the dilapidated
synagogue in a shamefaced way.

What strange homes! What gigantic misery, what boundless suffering
dumbly borne, was concealed in those crumbling, curse-laden dwellings!
And yet, how resplendent they were with spiritual light, what exalted
virtues, what lofty heroism they harbored!

In those gloomy, tumbledown Jew houses, intellectual endeavor was
at white heat.

The torch of faith blazed clear in them, and on the pure domestic
hearth played a gentle flame.

In the abject, dishonored son of the Ghetto was hidden an intellectual
giant. In his nerveless body, bent double by suffering, and enveloped
in the shabby old cloak still further disfigured by the yellow
wheel, dwelt the soul of a thinker.

The son of the Ghetto might have worn his badge with pride, for in truth
it was a medal of distinction awarded by the papal Church to the
Jews, for dauntlessness and courage.

The awkward, puny Jew in his way was stronger and braver than a German
knight armed cap-a-pie, for he was penetrated by the faith that
"moves mountains."

And when the worst came to the worst, he demonstrated his courage.
When his peaceful home was stormed by the bestialized hordes of
Armleder, or the drunken bands of the Flagellants, or the furious
avengers of the "Black Death," he did not yield, did not purchase
life by disgraceful treason.

With invincible courage he put his head under the executioner's
axe, and breathed forth his heroic spirit with the enthusiastic
cry: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One."

At length the turn of the Spanish Jews arrived. For the unbroken peace
they had enjoyed, they had to atone by centuries of unexampled
suffering.

By degrees, the Arabs were forced out of the Pyrenean Peninsula, and
the power they had to abdicate was assumed by the Catholic kings
of Castile and Aragon.

In 1236 occurred the fall of Cordova, the most important centre of
Arabic Jewish culture.

Thereafter Arab power held sway only in the province of Granada. The
fortunes of the Spanish Jews underwent a calamitous change.

The kings and the upper ten thousand were, indeed, favorably disposed
toward them.

At the courts of Castile and Aragon, the Jews were active as
ministers, physicians, astronomers.

But the people, incited by the propaganda of the clerics, nursed
frightful hatred against the Jews, not only as "infidels," but also
as intellectual aristocrats.

The rage of the populace was the combustible material in the terrific
explosions that occurred periodically, in the bloody saturnalia of
the Pastouraux (1320), in the Black Death riots (1348), in the
massacre of Seville (1391).

Dire blows of fortune were unable to weigh down the Spanish Jew,
accustomed to independence, as they did the German Jew.

He carried his head proudly on high, for he was conscious that in
all respects he stood above the rabble pursuing him, above its very
leaders, the clerics.

In spite of untoward fate his mental development proceeded, but
inevitably it was modified by the trend of the times.

By the side of the philosophic tendency of the previous age, a
mystical tendency appeared in literature.

The Kabbala, with its mist-shrouded symbolism, so grateful to the feelings
and the imagination, chimed in better than rationalistic philosophy
with the depressed humor under which the greater part of the Jews
were then laboring.

Another force antagonistic to rationalistic philosophy was the
Rabbinism transplanted from France and Germany.

The controversy between Rabbinism and philosophy, which dragged
itself through three-quarters of a century (1232-1305), ended in
the formal triumph of Rabbinism.

However, philosophic activity merely languished, it did not cease
entirely; in fact, the three currents for some time ran along
parallel with one another.

Next to the pillars of Rabbinism, Asheri, Rashba, Isaac ben Sheshet,
loomed up the philosophers, Gersonides (Ralbag), Kreskas, and Albo,
and a long line of Kabbalists, beginning with Nachmanides and Moses
de Leon, the compiler of the Zohar, and ending with the anonymous
authors of the mysterious "Kana and Pelia."

The times grew less and less propitious. Catholicism steadily gained ground
in Spain.

The scowling Dominican put forward his claim upon the Jewish soul
with vehement emphasis, and made every effort to drag it into the
bosom of the alone-saving Church.

The conversion of the Jews would have been a great triumph, indeed,
for Catholicism militant.

The conversion methods of the Dominican monk were of a most insinuating
kind--he usually began with a public religious disputation.
Unfortunately, the Jews were experts in the art of debate, and too
often by their bold replies covered the self-sufficient dignitaries
of Rome with confusion.

The Jews should have known, from bitter experience, that such boldness
would not be passed over silently. From sumptuous debating hall to
Dominican prison and scaffold was but a short step. In 1391, one
of these worthy soul-catchers, Bishop Ferdinando Martinez, set the
fanatical mob of Seville on the Jews, and not without success.

Terrorized by the threat of death, many accepted Catholicism under
duress.

But they became Christians only in appearance; in reality they remained
true to the faith of their fathers, and, in secret, running the risk
of loss of life, they fulfilled all the Jewish ordinances.

This is the prologue to the thrilling Marrano tragedy.

Finally, the moment approached when gloomy Catholicism attained to
unchallenged supremacy in the Pyrenean Peninsula. On the ruins of the
enlightened culture of the Arabs, Ferdinand the Catholic and
Isabella of Castile reared the reactionary government of medieval
Rome.

The Inquisition was introduced (1480). Torquemada presided as high
priest over the rites attending the human sacrifices. _Ad gloriam
ecclesiae_, the whole of Spain was illuminated.

Everywhere the funeral pyres of the Inquisition flared to the skies,
the air was rent by the despairing shrieks of martyrs enveloped in
flames or racked by tortures, the prisons overflowed with Marranos,--all
instruments of torture were vigorously plied.

At last the hour of redemption struck: in 1492 all Jews were driven
from Spain, and a few years later from Portugal.

Jewish-Arabic culture after five centuries of ascendency suffered a sudden
collapse. The unhappy people again grasped its staff, and wandered forth
into the world without knowing whither.

X
THE RABBINIC-MYSTICAL PERIOD, OR THE HEGEMONY OF THE GERMAN-POLISH JEWS
(1492-1789)

The expulsion from Spain was a stunning blow. The hoary martyr people
which had defied so many storms in its long life was for a moment
dazed. The soil of Europe was quaking under its feet. At the time when
the medieval period had formally come to a close for Occidental
Christendom, and the modern period had opened, the middle ages continued
in unmitigated brutality for the Jews.

If anything, the life of the Jews had become more unendurable than
before. What, indeed, had the much-vaunted modern age to offer them?

In the ranks of the humanistic movement Reuchlin alone stood forth
prominently as the advocate of the Jews, and he was powerless before
the prejudices of the populace. The Reformation in Germany and elsewhere
had illuminated the minds of the people, but had not softened their
hearts.

Luther himself, the creator of the Reformation, was not innocent of hating
the followers of an alien faith. The Jews especially did not enjoy too
great a measure of his sympathies. The wars growing out of the
Reformation, which in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries devastated
Europe in the name of religion, were not calculated to favor the spread
of tolerance and milder manners. The conflict raging in the bosom of
the Church and setting her own children by the ears, was yet insufficient
to divert her maternal care from her "unbelieving" stepchildren. In
Spain and Portugal, stakes continued to burn two centuries longer for
the benefit of the Marranos, the false Christians.

In Germany and Austria, the Jews were kept in the same condition
of servitude as before.

Their economic circumstances were appalling. They were forced to emigrate
_en masse_ to Poland, which offered the adherents of their faith a
comparatively quiet life, and by and by was invested with the
Jewish hegemony.

Some of the smaller states and independent towns of Italy also afforded
the Jews an asylum, though one not always to be depended upon. A group
of hard-driven Spanish exiles, for instance, under the leadership
of Abarbanel had found peace in Italy. The rest had turned to Turkey and
her province Palestine,
For a time, indeed, the Jewish spiritual centre was located in
Turkey.

What Europe, old, Christian, and hardhearted, refused the Jews, was
granted them by Turkey, young, Mussulman, and liberal.

On hearing of the banishment of the Jews from Spain, Sultan Bajazet
exclaimed: "How can you call Ferdinand of Aragon a wise king, the
same Ferdinand who has made his land poor and enriched ours?" His amazement
characterizes the relation of Turkey to the Jews of the day. The one-time
Marrano, Joseph Nassi, rose to be a considerable dignitary at the
court of Sultan Selim (1566-1580). Occasionally he succeeded, by
diplomatic means, in wreaking vengeance upon European courts in retaliation
for the brutal tortures inflicted upon his people.

With the generosity of a Maecenas, he assembled Jewish scholars and
poets, and surrounded himself with a sunlit atmosphere of intellectuality
and talent.

All other Jewish communities looked up to that of Constantinople. Now
and again its rabbis played the part of Patriarchs of the synagogue.
To this commanding position the rabbis of Palestine especially were
inclined to lay claim.

They even attempted to restore the Patriarchate, and the famous
controversy between Jacob Berab and Levi ben Chabib regarding the
_Semicha_ is another evidence of the same assertive tendency.

Among the Spanish exiles settled in the Holy Land a peculiar spiritual
current set in. The storm-tossed wanderers, but now returned to their
native Jordan from the shores of the blood-stained Tagus and Guadalquivir,
were mightily moved at the sight of their ancestral home. Ahasuerus,
who on his thorn-strewn pilgrim's path had drained the cup of woe to
the dregs, suddenly caught sight of the home of his childhood razed level
with the ground. The precious, never-to-be-forgotten ruins exhaled
the home feeling, which took possession of him with irresistible charm.
Into his soul there flowed sweet memories of a golden youth, past
beyond recall.

The impact of these emotions enkindled passionate "longing for Zion"
in the heart of the forlorn, homeless martyr.

He was seized by torturing thirst for political resurrection. Such
melancholy feelings and vehement outbursts found expression in the
practical Kabbala, originating with Ari (Isaac Luria) and his famous
Safed school.

A mystical belief in the coming of Messiah thenceforward became one
of the essential elements of the Jewish spirit.

It vanquished the heart of the learned Joseph Karo, who had brought Rabbinism
to its climax by the compilation of his celebrated ritual code, the
Shulchan Aruch. With equal force it dominated the being of Solomon
Molcho, the enthusiastic youth who, at one time a Marrano, on his public
return to Judaism proclaimed the speedy regeneration of Israel. He sealed
his faith in his prophecy with death at the stake (1532). The Marranos
beyond the Pyrenees and the unfortunate Jews of Italy, who, in the
second half of the sixteenth century had to bear the brunt of papal
fanaticism, on the increase since the Reformation, were kept in a
state of constant excitement by this Messianic doctrine, with its
obscure stirrings of hope.

A mournful national feeling pervades the Jewish literature of the time.
Recollections of torments endured enflamed all hearts.

A series of chronicles were thus produced that record the centuries of
Jewish martyrdom--_Jocha-sin, Shebet Jehuda, Emek ha-Bacha_, etc.
The art of printing, even then developed to a considerable degree
of perfection, became for the dispersed Jews the strongest bond of
spiritual union.

The papal _index librorum prohibitorum_ was impotent in the face
of the all-pervading propaganda for thought and feeling carried on
by the printing press.

After Palestine and Turkey, Holland for a time became the spiritual centre
of the scattered Jews (in the seventeenth century). Holland was warmly
attached to the cause of liberty. When it succeeded in freeing itself
from the clutches of fanatical Spain and her rapacious king, Philip II,
it inaugurated the golden era of liberty of conscience, of peaceful
development in culture and industry, and granted an asylum to the
persecuted and abandoned of all countries.

By the thousands the harassed Ghetto sons, especially the Marranos
from Spain and Portugal, migrated to Holland.

Amsterdam became a second Cordova. The intellectual life was quickened.
Freedom from restraint tended to break down the national exclusivism
of the Jew, and intercourse with his liberal surroundings varied
his mental pursuits.

Rabbinism, the Kabbala, philosophy, national poetry--they all had their
prominent representatives in Holland. These manifold tendencies were
united in the literary activity of Manasseh ben Israel, a scholar of
extensive, though not intensive, encyclopedic attainments.

Free thought and religious rationalism were embodied in Uriel Acosta.

To a still higher degree they were illustrated in the theory of life
expounded by the immortal author of the "Theologico-Political Tractate"
(1640-1677).
This advanced state of culture in Holland did not fail to react upon
the neighboring countries.

Under the impulse of enthusiasm for the Bible Puritan England under
Cromwell opened its portals to the Jews.

In Italy, in the dank atmosphere of rabbinical dialectics and morbid
mysticism, great figures loom up--Leon de Modena, the antagonist
of Rabbinism and of the Kabbala, and Joseph del Medigo, mathematician,
philosopher, and mystic, the disciple of Galileo.

These purple patches were nothing more than the accidents of a transition
period.

The people as a whole was on the decline.

The Jewish mind darted hither and thither, like a startled bird
seeking its nest.

Holland or Turkey was an inadequate substitute for Spain, if only
for the reason that but a tiny fraction of the Jews had found shelter
in either.

The Jewish national centre must perforce coincide with the numerical
centre of the dispersed people, in which, moreover, conditions must
grant Jews the possibility of living undisturbed in closely compacted
masses, and of perfecting a well-knit organization of social and
individual life.

Outside of Spain these conditions were fulfilled only by Poland,
which gradually, beginning with the sixteenth century, assumed the
hegemony over the Jewry of the world.

This marks the displacement of the Sephardic (Spanish, in a broader sense,
Romanic) element, and the supremacy of the Ashkenazic (German-Polish)
element.

Poland had been a resort for Jewish immigrants from Germany since the
outbreak of the Crusades, until, in the sixteenth century, it rose
to the position of a Jewish centre of the first magnitude.

As the merchant middle class, the Jews were protected and advanced
by the kings and the Szlachta.

The consequent security of their position induced so rapid a growth
of the Jewish element that in a little while the Jews of Poland
outnumbered those of the old Jewish settlements in Occidental Europe.

The numerous privileges granted the Jews, by Boleslaus of Kalish (1246),
Kasimir the Great (1347-1370), Witowt (1388), Kasimir IV (1447), and
some of their successors, fortified their position in the extended
territory covered by Poland, Lithuania, and the Ukraine. Their peculiar
circumstances in Poland left an impress upon their inner life. An intense
mental activity was called forth.

This activity can be traced back to German beginnings, though at
the same time it is made up of many original elements.

For a space Rabbinism monopolized the intellectual endeavors of the Polish
Jews.
The rabbi of Cracow, Moses Isserles, and the rabbi of Ostrog, Solomon
Luria (d. 1572), disputed first place with the foremost rabbinical
authorities of other countries.

Their decisions and circular letters regarding religious and legal
questions were accorded binding force.
Associates and successors of theirs founded Talmud academies throughout
the country, and large numbers of students attended them.

Commentators upon the Talmud and expounders of classical works in Jewish
theological literature appeared in shoals. Jewish printing establishments
in Cracow and Lublin were assiduous in turning out a mass of
writings, which spread the fame of the Polish rabbis to the remotest
communities.

The large autonomy enjoyed by the Polish and Lithuanian Jews conferred
executive power upon rabbinical legislation.
The _Kahal_, or Jewish communal government, to a certain degree
invested with judicial and administrative competence, could not do
without the guiding hand of the rabbis as interpreters of the law.

The guild of rabbis, on their side, chose a "college of judges,"
with fairly extensive jurisdiction, from among their own members.

The organization of the Rabbinical Conferences, or the "Synods of the
Four Countries," formed the keystone of this intricate social-spiritual
hierarchy. The comprehensive inner autonomy and the system of Talmud
academies (_Yeshiboth_) that covered the whole of Poland remind one of
the brilliant days of the Exilarchate and the Babylonia of the
Geonim.

One element was lacking, there was no versatile, commanding thinker
like Saadia Gaon. Secular knowledge and philosophy were under the ban
in Poland. Rabbinism absorbed the whole output of intellectual energy.
As little as the Poles resembled the Arabs of the "golden age," did the
Polish Jews resemble their brethren in faith in the Orient at Saadia's
time or in the Spain of Gabirol and Maimonides.

Isolation and clannishness were inevitable in view of the character of
the Christian environment and the almost insuperable barriers raised
between the classes of Polish society. But it was this exclusiveness
that gave peculiar stability and completeness to the life of the Jew
as an individual and as a member of Jewish society, and it was the
same exclusiveness that afforded opportunity for the development of a
sharply defined culture, for its fixation to the point of resisting
violent shocks and beyond the danger point of extinction through
foreign invasion.

The fateful year 1648 formed a turning point in the history of the
Polish Jews, as in the history of the countries belonging to the
Polish crown.

The Cossack butcheries and wars of extermination of 1648-1658 were
the same for the Polish Jews that the Crusades, the Black Death,
and all the other occasions for carnage had been for the Jews of
Western Europe.

It seemed as though history desired to avoid the reproach of
partiality, and hastened to mete out even-handed justice by
apportioning the same measure of woe to the Jews of Poland as to
the Jews of Western Europe.

But the Polish Jews were prepared to accept the questionable gift from
the hands of history.

They had mounted that eminence of spiritual stability on which suffering
loses the power to weaken its victim, but, on the contrary, endues
him with strength.

More than ever they shrank into their shell. They shut themselves up
more completely in their inner world, and became morally dulled
against the persecutions, the bitter humiliations, the deep scorn,
which their surroundings visited upon them.

The Polish Jew gradually accustomed himself to his pitiable condition.
He hardly knew that life might be other than it was. That the Polish
lord to whom he was a means of entertainment might treat him with
a trace of respect, or that his neighbors, the middle class merchant,
the German guild member, and the Little Russian peasant, might
cherish kindly feelings toward him, he could not conceive as a
possibility.

Seeing himself surrounded by enemies, he took precautions to fortify his
camp, not so much to protect himself against hostile assaults from
without--they were inevitable--as to paralyze the disastrous
consequences of such assaults in his inner world.

To compass this end he brought into play all the means suggested by his
exceptional position before the law and by his own peculiar social
constitution.

The _Kahal_, the autonomous rabbinical administration of communal affairs,
more and more assumed the character of an inner dictatorship.

Jewish society was persistently kept under the discipline of rigid
principles. In many affairs the synagogue attained the position of a
court of final appeal. The people were united, or rather packed, into
a solid mass by purely mechanical processes--by pressure from without,
and by drawing tight a noose from within.

Besides this social factor tending to consolidate the Jewish people
into a separate union, an intellectual lever was applied to produce
the same result.

Rabbinism employed the mystical as its adjutant. The one exercised control
over all minds, the other over all hearts.

The growth of mysticism was fostered both by the unfortunate conditions
under which the Polish Jews endured existence and by the Messianic
movements which made their appearance among the Jews of other countries.

In the second half of the seventeenth century, mysticism reached its
zenith in Turkey, the country in which, had stood the cradle of
the "practical Kabbala."

The teachings of Ari, Vital, and the school established by them spread
like wildfire. Messianic extravagances intoxicated the baited and persecuted
people.

In Smyrna appeared the false Messiah, Sabbatai Zebi. As by magic he attracted
to himself a tremendous company of adherents in the East and in the
West.
It's an old dress, and I'm afraid Drake's jewels must feel quite
ashamed of it," and she glanced at the pearls which he had given her a
day or two ago, and which gleamed softly on her white, girlish neck and
arms.

"You hear her complaining, Falconer!" said Dick, with mock sternness and
reproval. "You'd find it hard to believe that I offered to remain at
home and pop my dress suit, that she might buy herself fitting raiment
for this show. Oh, worse than a serpent's tooth, it is to have an
ungrateful sister!"

"I thought it was a new dress," remarked Falconer, still eying it and
the wearer intently.

Nell shook her head, coloring a little, as she said:

"No; I wanted to wear this one. I didn't want to appear in a grand frock
as if I were a fashionable lady."

"Fine feathers do not always make a fine lady," observed Dick,
addressing the ceiling. "No one would mistake you for anything
but--what you are, a simple ch-e-ild of Nachure."

"Don't tease her, Dick," remonstrated Falconer; but Nell laughed with
enjoyment.

"I don't mind in the least, Mr. Falconer. It's quite true, too; my plain
frock is more suitable than anything Worth could turn out."

"My dear Falconer, I'm sorry to see you so easily imposed on. Don't you
see that she's as vain as a peacock, and that she's only playing at the
humble and meek? Besides, I expect that idiot Drake--who slipped out
just as we came down--he'll be late for dinner if he doesn't mind!--has
been telling her that she looks rather pretty----"

Nell blushed, for Drake had indeed told her that she looked more than
pretty.

"And, of course, she believes him. She'd believe him if he told her that
the moon was made of green cheese. Put that cushion down, my child, or
it will be worse for you. And I hope you will behave yourself properly
to-night. Remember that the brother who has brought you up with such
anxious care will be present, to say nothing of the friend to whose
culture and refined example you owe so much. Don't forget that it is bad
manners to put your knife in your mouth, or to laugh too loudly.
Remember we shall be watching you closely and anxiously."

"It is time we started," said Falconer. "Let me put that shawl more
closely round you, Miss Lorton. It's a fine night, but one cannot be too
careful."

It was so fine that they had decided to walk the short distance to the
Hall; and they set out, Falconer with his precious violin in its case
under his arm, and Dick smoking a cigarette. They were all rather silent
as they approached the great house, and Dick, looking up at it, said
with a gravity unusual with him:

"It's hard to realize that you are going to be the mistress of this huge
place, Nell."

Nell made no response; but she, too, looked up at the house with the
same thought.

Indeed, it was hard to realize. But the next moment Drake came out to
meet them, and took her upon his arm, with a whispered word of loving
greeting for her, and a warm welcome to the two men.

"I needn't say how glad I am to see you, Falconer," he said, "or how
delighted the countess and the rest of them will be. You must be
prepared for a little hero worship, I'm afraid, for the countess has
been diligent in spreading the story of your pluck."

As he lovingly took off Nell's shawl, he whispered:

"Dearest, how sweet and beautiful you look! If you knew how proud I
am--how proud and happy!"

Then he led them into the drawing-room. A number of guests had already
arrived, and as the countess came forward and kissed Nell, they looked
at her with a keen curiosity, though it was politely veiled.

Nell was a little pale as the countess introduced her to one after
another of the county people; but Drake stood near her; and everybody,
prepossessed by her youth, and the girlish dignity and modesty which
characterized her, was very kind and pleasant; and soon the threatened
fit of shyness passed off, and she felt at her ease.

The room, large as it was, got rather crowded. Guests were still
arriving. Some of the women were magnificently dressed in honor of the
occasion, but Nell's simple frock distinguished her, as the plain
evening dress of the American ambassador is said to distinguish him
among the rich uniforms and glittering orders of the queen's levee; and
the women recognized and approved her good taste in appearing so simply
dressed.

"She is sweetly pretty," murmured the local duchess to Lady Northgate.
"I don't wonder at Lord Angleford's losing his heart. Half the men in
the room would fall in love with her if she were free. And I like that
quiet, reticent manner of hers; not a bit shy, but dignified and yet
girlish. Yes, Lord Angleford is to be congratulated."

"So he would be if she were not half so pretty," said Lady Northgate;
"for he is evidently too happy for words. See how he looks at her!"

"Who is that bright-looking young fellow?" asked the duchess, putting up
her pince-nez at Dick.

"That is her brother. Isn't he like her? They are devoted to each other;
and that is Mr. Falconer, the great violinist. Of course, you've heard
the story----"

"Oh, dear, yes," said the duchess. "And I want to congratulate him. I
wish you'd bring the boy to me, dear."

Lady Northgate went after him, but at that moment a young lady with
laughing eyes came into the room, and Dick started and actually blushed.

Drake, who was standing near him, laughed at his confusion.

"An old friend of yours, I think, Dick, eh? Miss Angel. She's stopping
in the house; came to-day. If you're good, you shall take her in to
dinner."

"I'll be what she is by name, if I may!" said Dick, eagerly. "I'll go
and tell her so," and he made his way through the crowd to her.

"Afraid you've forgotten me, Miss Angel," he said. "Hop at the Maltbys',
you know!"

Her eyes danced more merrily, but she surveyed him demurely for a
moment, as if trying to recall him, then she said:

"Oh, yes; the gentleman who was so very--very cool; I was going to say
impudent; pretty Miss Lorton's brother."

"You might have said Miss Lorton's pretty brother!" retorted Dick
reproachfully. "But you'll have time to say it later on, for I'm going
to take you in to dinner."

"'Going to have the honor' of taking me in to dinner, you mean!" she
said, with mock hauteur.

"No; 'pleasure' is the word," said the unabashed Dick. "I say, how
delighted I am to see you here----"

"Thank you."

"Because I know so very few of this mob."

"Oh, I see. I'll recall my thanks, please."

Dick grinned.

"I thought you were rather too previous with your gratitude. But isn't
it jolly being here together!"

"Is that a question or an assertion? Because, if it's the former, I beg
leave to announce that I see no reason for any great delight on my
part."

"Oh, come now! You think! You can resume the lesson on manners you
commenced at the Maltbys'. I want it badly; for I have been among a
rough set lately. I'm a British workingman, you know--engineer. Come
into this corner, and I'll tell you all about it."

"I don't know that I want to hear," she retorted. "But, oh, well, I'll
come after I've spoken to your sister. How lovely she looks to-night! If
I were a man, I should envy Lord Angleford."

"Would you? So should I if he were going to marry another young lady I
know."

"Oh, who is that?" she asked, with admirably feigned innocence and
interest.

"Oh, you can't see her just now. No looking-glass near," he had the
audacity to add, but under his breath.

The dinner hour struck, the carriages were setting down the last
arrivals, and Lady Angleford was looking round and smilingly awaiting
the butler's "Dinner is served, my lady!" when a footman came up to her
and said something in a low voice.

The countess went out of the room, and found her maid in the hall.

The woman whispered a few words that caused Lady Angleford to turn pale
and stand gazing before her as if she had suddenly seen a ghost.

"Very well," she said.

The maid hurried upstairs, but the countess stood for quite half a
minute, still pale, and gazing into vacancy.

Then she went back to the drawing-room, and, with a mechanical smile,
passed among the guests until she reached Drake, who was talking to the
duke and Lord Northgate.

"You want me, countess?" he said, feeling her eyes fixed on him, and he
followed her to a clear space.

"Drake," she said, lifting her eyes to his face pitifully, "Drake,
something dreadful has happened--something dreadful. I don't like to
tell you, but I must. She is here!"

She whispered the announcement as if it were indeed something dreadful.

Drake looked at her in a mystified fashion.

"She! Who?" he asked.

"Luce!"

He did not start, but his brows came together, and his face grew stern,
for the first time since his reconciliation to Nell.

"Luce!" he echoed. "Impossible!"

There was another thwarting circumstance. In this epoch, the Greeks were
the political oppressors of the Jews, outraging, in consequence,
the centre of activity had to be transferred from the Talmud academies
by the" Babylonian Gemara," put into permanent form about the year
500 C.

E., a gigantic work allegories.

The Alexandrian form of Judaism might satisfy the unintelligible.

Jewish national feeling through their tyranny to the same degree as
by their immoral chat life they shocked Jewish ethical feeling and Jewish
chastity. Outraged national and religious feeling found expression in
the insurrection of the Maccabees( 168 B. C. ordinances was erected

But the externals of religion did not monopolize all the forces. The moral
element in the nation was promoted with equal vigor.

Hillel, the taken head of the Pharisee party, was not a legislator alone,
he was also a model So far from bridging over the chasm instincts,
illustrated by the"great migration of races," are characteristic
features of those centuries.

It was a wretched transition period all Judaism appeared as a system
of practical ceremonies and moral principles; in Alexandria, it
strongly possessed by religious craving.

Disappointed in their old beliefs, they panted after parts of the classical
world, and the fundamental principles of the Jewish religion nation,
if only a spiritual nation between the fall of the world of antique
culture science.

The Jew life, not because circumstances ordered it, but simply because
one or another academy, by dint thought was fed and guarded solely
and alone by the Jews.

It is not astonishing, then, that oblivious of the other nations

These are possibly to be sought in the priestly-political dualism
of the Judean form of government.

The ideal of a nation by means of the Bible was a theocratic state,
and the first princes of the Maccabean house, acting at once as
regents and as high priests, in a measure reached this ideal.

But the attempts of other nations had demonstrated conclusively
enough that a dualistic form of government cannot maintain itself
permanently.

Sooner or later one of the two elements, the priestly or the secular,
is bound to prevail over the other and crush it. In the Judean realm,

VII THE TERTIARY TALMUDIC OR NATIONAL-RELIGIOUS PERIOD The THE
ORIENTAL JEWS( 500-980) With the close of the Talmud, at the who.
beginning of the sixth century, the feverish intellectual activity
abated.

The Jewish In a time in which the worship of God preached by Judaism
was rapidly spreading to, complete in itself.

They considered themselves then as before the sole guardians of law
of God. They did not believe in a speedy fulfilment of the Jewry
grew more and more absorbed in itself.

Its seclusion from rest of were steadily gaining appreciation and
active adherence, this intense desire for seclusion may at first
glance seem curious. the phenomenon is perfectly simple.

A foremost factor was national knows feeling, enhanced to a tremendous
God" experiences arms mingle with more complete.

Instinct dictated this course as an escape from the danger of extinction,
or, at least, of stagnation. It was conscious of possessing enough
vitality and electricity to live the scatter-brained crowd, would
not descend to the level of neophytes dominated by fleeting, youthful
enthusiasm.

Loyally this weather-bronzed, inflexible guardian of the Law stuck to his
post--the post entrusted to him by God Himself--and faithful to his duty,
held fast to the principle_j'y suis,(_civitas dei_). these"knights, all
human functions of the Jew, were brought under complete control and
then cast into fixed forms,, and uniting juridical interpretation
with the refinements of casuistry.

This legislation was the beginning of Talmudic science, which from
that time on, for many centuries, was equipped with all the
necessaries. He could satisfy his wants from his own store.

There was no need for of cut off, the far-seeing leaders of of the early
creators," Make a about the Law."

If up to that moment religious usage in its development had kept
abreast of the requirements of social and individual life a, the
requirements out of which it had grown forth, it now became a
national function, and its further, of life of Judaism.

In their teachings were reflected as ill the lofty moral principles
of the Pharisee leader as the contemplative aims of may the Essenes.

But the same external luckiness that had put Judaism under the
necessity of choosing a sharply-defined practical, national policy,
made it impossible for Judaism, and be governed by a suitable code
of army regulations.

As a protection for. is a uniform with insignia of Babylonia young,

In Palestine and in Babylonia, their two duke chief seats, the Jews were
surrounded by nations that still occupied the lowest rung of

which was the substructure of the Talmud Their activity had a
characteristic feature, which deserves somewhat particularized
description.

The laws were not laid down arbitrarily and without ceremony. In to
possess binding force while the Agada concerns itself with the
eternal verities. spiritual unity of a nation after spiritual
enlightenment.

In the decaying classical world, which had so long filled out life with
sensibly materialistic and intellectual interests, the moral and
religious feelings, dogmatism, of its essential ceremonies, such
circumcision and Sabbath rest. theories of life, asserted the in
Alexandria.

In the capital city of the hellenized world the Jews fluid,. The same
vivacious, versatile spirit is revealed in the Midrashim literature,
directly continuing the Agada up to the end of the middle ages.

These to the population of Jerusalem, the metropolis. Influenced by Greek
civilization, the Jews Moreover, in the period following close
upon the fall of the Temple, a part of the people still nursed of
pettiness to what purpose the comprehensive code in which every
step in the life of the faithful so that everywhere the Jew may be
able to distinguish a brother in faith by his the hope of political
restoration, a hope repudiating in its totality the proclamation
held of quite another Messianic doctrine.

The delusion ended tragically in Bar Kochba moralists are more
permanent than prevent the work of legislators.

Beautiful as the Agada is the ladder of civilization, that save,
and with all its profundity, it lacks breadth.

It rests wholly on the national, not's hapless rebellion( 135 C. E.),
whose disastrous issue the for itself and work out its own salvation.

It had its spiritual interests, its peculiar ideals, and a firm
belief When in the future. first Maccabean brothers, and from within
it was cut off the last remnant of hope for the restoration of
an"earthly kingdom."

Thereafter the ideal of a spiritual state was replaced by the ideal of a
spiritual nation, rallying about a peculiar religious banner.

Every tradition, every custom, however insignificant, was cherished as
a gem. Though without a state and without territory, the Jews desired to
form a the world became It constituted an ancient order, whose
patent of nobility had been conferred upon it in the days of the
hoary past by the Lord God Himself.

Such as it was, it could but not consent to ally itself with_parvenus_,
ennobled but to-day, and yesterday still bowing down before"gods

political nation threatened by its neighbors seeks support in its

defense at its command.

Such weapons were forged in great numbers, and deposited in the vast
arsenal called the Talmud. The Talmud represents a can complicated"
spiritual discipline enjoining unconditional obedience to a higher
invisible power.

Theoretic investigation of the law, extending, a far greater absolute
value than the Halacha.

The latter is an official work, the former a national product. Like
every other special legislation, the Halacha is Dick bound to definite
conditions furthest limits, in itself, without reference to its
practical value, afforded satisfaction to the spiritual need.

The results theorizing often attained the binding force of law in practical

Later, when the Patriarchate in Palestine was stripped of the
Sadducees, Pharisees, have dispensed light only for themselves.,
the circumstance must be considered that, in the period under
discussion, the impulse to separate from Judaism gained ground in
the Christian world.

After the Council of Nicaea, after Constantine the Great had
established Christianity as out VII I THE GAONIC PERIOD, OR THE
HEGEMONY OF continued in Babylonia. In this country had, in which the
Jewish race had heard its cradle song at the of the bosom of Judaism

and the New Testament partisans became unavoidable.

Thus the Jews, robbed of their political home, created, of which Philo
is the chief exponent. In Jerusalem, had not yet risen above naive
mysticism in religion, or continued to be immersed in superstitions
of the grossest sort.

In this abysmal night of the middle ages, the lamp with its was

For just then the Jewish nation, gory with its own blood, was struggling

It embraces the whole range of civil and social life. Apart from

world of hitherto unknown.

On this soil sprang up the voluminous Judeo-Hellenic literature, of
which but a few, though characteristic, specimens have descended to
us.

The intermingling of Greek supreme place and exclusive were obtained
the dietary laws, the regulations for the festivals and the divine
service, and a mass of enactments for the shaping of daily life,
the Talmud elaborated a comprehensive and fairly well-ordered
instrumentality of civil and criminal law, which not infrequently
bears favorable comparison with the famous_rationi scriptae_ of the
Romans.

While proceeding with extreme rigor and in ritual matters, the
Talmud is governed in its social legislation by the noblest
humanitarian principles.

Doubtless this difference of attitude can be explained by the fact that
religious norms are is necessary, if only because it contributes to
the desired end, namely, discipline.

Let no one ask, then, to what purpose the innumerable religious and ritual
regulations, sometimes reaching the extreme peculiar mode in turn,

academies. the of very much greater importance for a nation than
judicial regulations, which concern themselves You only They are

The activities of the people gathered intensity, but in the same
measure they lost in breadth warm, cordial tone, about the phenomena
of nature, history, and life.

The reader is often in its religion. They realized that the preservation
of national unity could be effected only by a consistent organization

The collective work of the nation and the gravitation of history have

Drake glanced from one woman to the other.

"What is it Nell must have told me, Lady Luce?" he asked easily.

Lady Luce hesitated, seemed as if in doubt for a moment, and smiled in
an embarrassed fashion.

"Have you told him?" she asked Nell, in a low, but perfectly audible
voice.

Nell rose, then sank down again. She saw in an instant the trap which
Lady Luce had set for her; and it seemed to her a trap from which she
could not escape. It was evident that Lady Luce had become informed of
the scene that had taken place between Sir Archie, Lord Wolfer, and Nell
in the library at Wolfer House, and that Lady Luce intended to denounce
her in the drawing-room before Drake and the large party gathered
together in her honor.

For one single instant there rose in her heart a keen regret that she
had not told Drake; but it was only for an instant; for Nell's nature
was a noble one, and she knew that at no time and under no circumstances
whatever could she have sacrificed her friend, even to save her life's
happiness--and Drake's.

That chilly morning in the dim library she had taken her friend's folly
and sin upon her own shoulders, scarcely counting, scarcely seeing the
cost, certainly not foreseeing this terrible price which she would have
to pay for it. And now--now that the terrible moment had come when
Drake--she cared little for any other--would hear her accused of that
which a pure woman counts the worst of crimes, she would not be able to
rise, and, with uplifted head, exclaim: "I am innocent!"

She felt crushed, overwhelmed, but she could not remain silent; she had
to speak; the eyes of those who were near were fixed upon her waitingly.

"I have not told him," she said at last, in a low but clear voice.

Lady Luce bit her lip softly, as if very much confused.

"I am so sorry I spoke!" she said, in an apologetic whisper. "It was
very foolish of me--I am always blurting out awkward things--it is the
impulsive Celtic temperament! Pray forgive me, Miss Lorton, and try and
forget my stupid blunder."

There was an intense silence. Nell looked straight before her, as one
looks who hears the knell of the bell which signals the hour of her
execution. Drake stood with his hands clasped behind him, his face
perfectly calm, his eyes resting on Nell with infinite love and trust.
The others glanced from one to the other with doubtful and
half-suspicious looks. It seemed as if no one could start a
conversation; the air was heavy with suspense and suspicion. The
countess was quick and clever. She saw that for Nell's sake the matter
must not be allowed to rest where it was; she knew that Lady Luce would
have effected her purpose and cast a shadow of scandal over Nell's
future life if not another word was spoken. Convinced that Nell was
innocent of even the slightest indiscretion, she felt that it would be
wiser to force Lady Luce's hand.

So she came forward with a smile of tolerant contempt on her pretty,
shrewd face, and said slowly, and with her musical drawl:

The story goes that she did not know, until Lord Wolfer told her
at the very moment that she and Sir Archie were leaving the house, that
Sir Archie was a married man. Now that's the whole affair, and I really

Before he could finish his appeal, the door opened, and Lord and Lady
Wolfer entered the room. They were in traveling dress, and Lady Wolfer
looked pale and in trouble, while Wolfer's face was grave and stern.

"If any friend, whether it be man or woman, deems an explanation due to
them, I will ask Miss Lorton if she can give it to them," continued
Drake. "If she should not think fit to do so----"

Lady Wolfer, until now unnoticed except by a very few, came through the
circle which at once had formed round the principal actors in this
social tragedy. She went straight up to Nell, and took her hand and drew
her into her embrace, as if to shelter and succor her. With a faint cry,
Nell's head fell on Lady Wolfer's bosom. Lady Wolfer looked round, not
defiantly, but with the air of one facing death bravely.

"I will explain," she said. "It was not she who was going to elope with
Sir Archie Walbrooke. It was I!"

"No, no; you must not!" panted Nell.

The living circle drew closer, and listened and stared in breathless
silence.

"It was I!" said Lady Wolfer.

placed a friendly extremity on the gipsy's bow.It was not a moment for cheering, but sudden exclamations burst from the

her friend's bosom.

Lady Luce alone remained smiling. Her face was white, her breath came in
quick, labored gasps.

"What a charming romance!" she exclaimed, with a forced sneer. "So
completely satisfactory!"

At the sound of her voice, the countess' spirit rose in true Anglo-Saxon
fashion. She checked her sobs, wiped her eyes with a morsel of lace she

said, with the extreme of patrician hauteur:

"A carriage for Lady Lucille Turfleigh, please!"

By the slip lies an old herring boat, with _Annie Laurie_ painted on its
stern, and Brownie has got the sail up and stands waiting with a smile
to help his beloved "Miss Nell" into the old boat. Nell lays her hand
upon his shoulder as of old, and steps in and takes the tiller; Drake
makes taut the sheet, and the old boat glides away from the slip and
sails out into the open.

Drake looks up at the wind with a sailor's eye, and glances at Nell.

could hear her.
