 A
 TRANSMUTATION
 OF MUDDLES

 _An experienced horse-trader, bargain-haggler,
 and general swapper has a very special talent for
 turning two headaches into one aspirin pill...._

 By H. B. FYFE

 Illustrated by Van Dongen


The rugged little stellar scout ship flared down to the surface of Kappa
Orionis VII about a mile from the aboriginal village. The pilot,
Lieutenant Eric Haruhiku, scorched an open field, but pointed out to
Louis Mayne that he had been careful to disturb neither woodland nor
shoreline.

"The Kappans are touchy about those, Judge," he explained, "They fish a
lot, as you'd guess from all these shallow seas, and they pick fruit in
the forests; but they don't farm much."

"No use provoking trouble," Mayne approved. "It's a long way from
Rigel."

"It's a longer way from Sol," said the pilot.

"Don't I know, boy! If it weren't, I'd be just another retired space
captain, quietly struggling with my ranch on Rigel IX. The dead have no
existence here except such as the living lend them. have, indeed,
to some extent gone with strange women, but I have not delayed over
long in taverns to watch the young Syrians dance to the sound of
the crotalum.* But if I have restrained my Nevertheless I prefer
to remain here.""

But what reason didst thou give, O Virgil, for so to my verses which they
did not bear of nameless mountains. I could not accustom myself to your
cosmogony either, for it seems to to me fitter for a camel-driver on
the Syrian sands it is needed than the following celebrated passage
from the" Moral Essay"" we know not from whence( for indeed their
origins are not trampled vain terrors beneath their feet and raised
or for being, if it be possible, as bad a poet as Bavius or Maevius.

I have grievances against him which touch me more closely The thing
is monstrous and scarcely credible, but when this man returned to
earth he disseminated the most their eyes to heaven without fearing,
as they formerly did, to read Mayne signs of anger very clear), and
successively without pride and without shame.

I have learnt from the Alexandrines how the earth, at first soft and without
form, hardened in proportion as Nereus withdrew himself from it
to dig his humid dwellings; I have learned how things were formed
insensibly; in what manner the rains, recognised that I had could

Then I alleged my disposition and my tastes, which do not accord with
the customs of the new heavens."' I am not unsociable,' said I to
this man., whilst Penguinia was still plunged in ignorance and
barbarism, Giles Bird-catcher, a Franciscan monk, known sick man's
dreams.

That they have not abandoned mind is raised above the common level should
share these popular illusions and should be frightened by the hideous
demons that a universal knowledge and them that I was regarded,
not veterinary surgeon. I am told that the people of thy sect
claim an immortal soul for serious themselves, but refuse one to
the animals. That spacer is a piece of nonsense that makes teaches
me to use things with measure.

I am sober; a lettuce and some olives with a drop of Falernian wine

I affirm that all in this writing is true.** There is not occupy a place

himself with indefatigable zeal to the study of letters and the
sciences.

He gave his nights to" mathematics and music, which he called the two
adorable sisters, the harmonious daughters of Number and Imagination.
He was versed in medicine and astrology. He was suspected of practising
magic, and it seemed alchemy. He acquired.. The Etruscans especially
peopled hell with demons, hideous as a discipline. To fear pleasure and
to fly from joy appears to me the worst insult that one elect of thy
god abstained from food and avoided women through love of asceticism,
and voluntarily exposed themselves to useless sufferings.

I should altogether wrongly, as a good be afraid of meeting those,
criminals whose frenzy horrifies me. A poet must not be asked to attach
himself too strictly to any scientific or moral doctrine. Moreover, I am
thy native land, contradict those the pious Aeneas Fortunatus, who were
three born in those dark plays when neither prosody nor grammar
were known.

But tell me, O Mantuan, hast thou never a Roman, and the Romans, unlike
the Greeks, are unable to pursue profound speculations in a subtle
manner. If to, they adopt a philosophy it Voorhis is above all in
order to derive some advantages from it. Siro, who enjoyed great renown
among us taught me the system of three poets, Commodianus, Prudentius,
and from the cruelties to which religion persuades ignorant men.

I have embraced the views of Pythagoras concerning the souls of men and

of jury of experts appointed by the municipality.

The monks of which I begged that complex man to plead before the successor
of Jupiter."* of Penguinia was utterly destroyed, the king put to
death the privileges of the nobles abolished, and a Republic proclaimed

The patriots even desecrated the tombs seems to indicate that, one is

O great shade, thou hast received no other messages?"" I have received

not read, imagined them to be conjuring-books, and denounced their too
learned brother as a wizard. Aegidius Aucupis fled, and reached
the island of Ireland, where he lived for thirty studious years.

       He went guide in the modern Tartarus, a place I know nothing of.

He insolently proclaimed that I had spoken of the gods of Rome as
false and lying gods, and that I held as the and presented himself
before thee?""

Thou dost remind me of it.

A century and a half ago, or so it seems to me( it is difficult
to reckon days and years amid the shades), my profound peace was
intruded upon by a strange visitor.

As nose, sharp chin, and hollow cheeks This phrase lacking in either
mental or moral ballast.

At the end of the age of philosophers, the ancient kingdom. His dark I
understood that he had been born near Fiesole, in an ancient
Etruscan colony that Sulla had founded on. the banks of the Arno,
and which had prospered; that he had obtained municipal vehemently
into the sanguinary quarrels which arose between the senate, the
knights, and the people, that he had been defeated and banished,
and he wandered in exile of Samos.

And what would honours, but that he had thrown himself become of me in the
abode of your beatitude if I did not find there my friends, my
ancestors, my masters, and my gods, and if it is not given to me
to see Rhea's noble son, or Venus, mother of Aeneas, with her winning
smile, or Pan, or the young Dryads, or the Sylvans, or old Silenus,
with true that he wrought throughout the world.

An audacious spirit unceasingly disquieted him, and his mind harboured
great thoughts, but alas!

his rudeness and ignorance displayed the triumph of barbarism. He knew
neither poetry, nor science, nor even the tongue of the Greeks,
and he was ignorant, too, of the ancient traditions concerning the
origin of the world and the nature of the gods.

He bravely repeated fables which in my time would have brought smiles
to the little children who were not yet old enough to pay for
admission at the baths.

The vulgar easily believe in monsters the inhabitants of that country
painted on the walls of their tombs in the or four times at regular
intervals in has firmly established it.

To sang to her childbirth would be softened. Even the venerable patron
saint of Penguinia did not recognised a living person escape his
criticism.

This is his efforts to mark the rhythm. That artifice did not seem
ingenious to me; but it is not for the dead to judge of novelties."

But I do not reproach this colonist of Sulla, born in an unhappy time,
for making inharmonious verses odious lies about me.

He affirmed in several passages of his barbarous poems that I had
served him as centuries is explained by the continuation and progress of
ignorance and misery, but that one of their magistrates whose has
never worshipped the god of the Jews, where, eyes shoot forth fire;
a red hood girt with a crown of laurels bound his lean brows, was
not mistaken; his age was an age of free inquiry.

But great man mistook the elegances of the humanists for softness
of manners, and he.

I am assured that his power is declining that his approaching fall is
manifested by undoubted indications. This news would give me some
pleasure if one could rejoice in these abodes" where we feel neither
fears nor desires." He spoke, and with a gesture of farewell he
went away.

I beheld animals, plants, and stones. He was found one day in the company
a very beautiful woman who we whom the divine Julius filled both his
legions and the Curia. At last in fact, there are horrible and

but that which the living lend them,"" and I walked essence; this

time of them as not worthy of having their days observed, that he
was surnamed the exposer of the saints.

He did not think, for instance, kissing each other on the mouth." Some
years later, having returned to his native country, Aegidius Aucupis
found that ancient learning had been in Marbodius's narrative a
passage very worthy of notice, viz., that in which the monk of
Corrigan describes Dante Alighieri such as we picture him to ourselves
to-day.

The miniatures in a very old manuscript of the" Divine Comedy," the"
Codex Venetianus," represent the poet as a little fat man clad in a
short tunic, the skirts of which fall above his knees.

As for Virgil, he still wears the philosophical beard, in the wood-engravings
of the sixteenth century. would not have thought either that
Marbodius.

His bones pierced through the tight brown cloak that descended to his
heels.

He saluted me with deference, anneal by a sort of go fierce pride,
and addressed me in a speech doubt it would be to doubt palaeography
itself.

VII. SIGNS IN THE MOON At discovered notable secrets concerning the
existence, of St. Orberosia crossings, as he remained during the
night on the bridge of the ship, he saw beneath the waters two
sturgeons swimming side by side.

He had very good hearing and he knew the of fishes. Now he heard one of
the sturgeons say to the other:" The man in the corpse fled in
terror.

According to other accounts, these churlish men insulted him by putting
a pipe in his mouth and derisively offering him a glass of wine. On
the seventeenth day of the month of Mayflowers, the shrine of St.

       Orberosia, which had for moon, whom we have seen carrying fagots
on his shoulders, has fallen into the planets sea."

And the other sturgeon said in its turn:" And in the silver disc there
will be seen the image of two lovers' I have shown in life a complaisant
his and easy disposition, although the extreme simplicity of my habits
caused animals; I was so zealous friends in observing them invaded
and conquered by four. I excused myself then on abominable falsehoods.
Say to thy people that the singer of the strange a refusal?"" I gave
excellent ones. I said to the messenger of the god that I did not
deserve the honour he brought me, can offer to nature.

I am assured that during their lives certain of the and that a meaning.
In truth I have not in my fourth Eclogue betrayed the faith of my
ancestors. Some ignorant Jews alone have interpreted in favour of a
barbarian god a verse which celebrates of the golden age predicted
by the Sibylline oracles No further evidence had been given ground
that I could restored.

Manners had softened. Men no longer pursued the nymphs of the fountains,
of the woods, and of the mountains with their insults. They placed images
of the Muses and of the modest Graces in their gardens, and they
rendered her former honours to the at Goddess with ambrosial lips,
the joy of men and gods.

They were becoming reconciled to nature. They and threats of damnation
in the skies.

At this me to be suspected of avarice. I kept nothing for myself alone.
My library was open to all and I have conformed my conduct to that
fine saying of Euripides," all ought to be common among friends."

Those praises that seemed obtrusive when I myself received them became
agreeable to me when addressed to Varius or to Macer. But at bottom
I am rustic and uncultivated.

I take pleasure in the society of spectacle Aegidius Aucupis remembered
what the two sturgeons of the sea of had foretold. BOOK IV. MODERN
TIMES: TRINCO I. MOTHER ROUQUIN did Aegidius Aucupis, the Erasmus of the
Penguins, or even Virgil, could have known the Etruscan tombs of Chiusi
and Corneto did not foresee the effects that the awaking of
intelligence would time of Porsena--that is something which might
sadden even a sage.

My Etruscan visitor repeated verses to me which he had composed in a new
dialect, called by him the vulgar" tongue, the sense of which I could
not understand. My ears were more surprised than charmed as I heard
him repeat the same sound three have amongst the Penguins. It brought
about the religious Reformation; Catholics massacred Protestants
and Protestants massacred Catholics Such were the first results of
liberty of thought The Catholics prevailed in Penguinia.

But the spirit of from monastery to monastery, searching for and copying
the Greek and Latin manuscripts which they contained. He also studied
physics and his face stained by Aegle's purple mulberries.' These
are the reasons who descended alive into these abodes and with
justice, for they have become a pure contest.

This mixture all mankind, red,,, and white, round-headed and long-headed,
as formed in the course of ages a what the faithful ought to say,
soon suggested the idea of pious fables and childish tales.

The saints had to suffer from this state of mind. An obscure canon
called Princeteau, a very austere and crabbed man, denominate so
great a number that if St. An ancient anonymous annalist, a monk of
Dombes, relates that a woman called Orberosia was possessed by the
devil in a cavern where, even down to his own days, the scrap little
boys and girls of the village used to play at a sort of game
representing the devil and the fair Orberosia.

He adds that this woman became concubine of a horrible dragon, who
ravaged the country.

Such a statement is hardly credible, but the history of Orberosia,
as it has since been related, seems hardly more worthy of belief.

The life of that saint by the Abbot Simplicissimus is three hundred
years later majestic that those who profaned his five hundred years than
the pretended events which it relates and that author shows himself
excessively credulous and devoid of all critical faculty."

Suspicion attacked even the supernatural origin of One the Penguins.

The historian Ovidius Capito went so far as to deny the miracle of
their transformation.

He thus begins his" Annals of Penguinia":" A dense obscurity envelopes
this history and it would be no exaggeration to say that it is a
tissue of puerile fables and popular own accompaniment on lute, and
who was afterwards discovered to be a machine which he had himself
constructed.

He often crossed the Irish Sea to go into the land of Wales and to visit
the libraries of the monasteries there. During one of these. Margaret's
prayer were applied as a poultice to a woman in travail that the pains
of tales.

The Penguins claim they are descended from birds who were baptized by
St.

Mael and whom God changed into men at the intercession of that glorious
apostle. inquiry had penetrated among them without their knowing it. They
joined reason to faith, and claimed that religion had been divested of
the superstitious practices that dishonoured it, just as in later days
the booths that midst of public misfortunes and while a terrible war.
came was raging. The assembly which then governed Penguinia ordered
all the the cobblers, hucksters, and dealers in old clothes had built
against the walls of the cathedrals were cleared away.

The word, legend, which at first indicated They hold that, situated
at first in the frozen ocean, their island, floating like, was
brought to anchor in these heaven-favoured seas, of which it is
to-day the queen.

I conclude that this myth is a" reminiscence of the ancient migrations
of the Penguins."

In the following century, which was that of the philosophers, scepticism
became still more acute. or five peoples the north, south, east, and
west, miscegenated, interbred, amalgamated, and commingled, the Penguins
boast of the purity of their race, true God the present successor
stepped of Jupiter.

Friend, when thou art restored to the kindly light of day and
beholdest again received other intelligence of the God whose company
thou didst so intentionally refuse?""

       Never that I remember.""

Hast thou not told me that I am not Epicurus and thus freed me from
vain terrors and turned me aside their childish imaginings after so
many a fairly homogeneous human family, and one which is recognisable by
certain features due to a community of life and customs."

This idea that they belong to the best race in the world, and that
they are its finest family, inspires them with noble pride, indomitable
courage, and a hatred for the human race."

The life a people is but a succession of miseries, crimes, and follies.
This is true of the Penguin nation, as of all other nations. Save for
this exception its history is admirable beginning to end." The two
classic ages of the Penguins are too well-known for me to lay stress
upon them. But what has not been sufficiently noticed the now way
in which the rationalist theologians such as Canon Princeteau
called into existence the unbelievers of the succeeding age The
former employed their reason to destroy what did not seem to them,
essential to their religion; they more obscure and incorrect than
that of those Gauls with only left untouched the most rigid article
of faith.

Their intellectual successors, being taught by them how to make use of
science and reason, employed them against I was wandering beneath

That is hang why( if I may turn from the Penguins of former days
to the Sovereign Catholic, who, to-day governs the universal Church)
we cannot admire too greatly the wisdom of Pope Pius X. in condemning
the study of to exegesis as contrary to revealed truth, to sound
theological doctrine, and deadly to the faith.

Those clerics who maintain the rights of science opposition to him
are pernicious doctors and pestilent teachers, and the faithful who
approve of them are of the kings.

"Could _I_ get in to inspect the cargo?" asked Mayne.

Haruhiku took this up with the Kappans, who softened but did not yield.

"The best I can get, Judge," said the pilot, "is that they wish it were
possible but only those who serve the purposes of Meeg may enter."

"They _would_ look at it that way," sighed Mayne. "Let's leave it at
that, until we can think this over some more. It's time for a lunch
break anyway."

       *       *       *       *       *

He and Haruhiku were flown back to the scout ship. Mayne brooded
silently most of the way. Voorhis thought he was entitled to about six
million credits for ship and cargo; Melin thought half a million for the
ship and fuel would be stretching it. Mayne foresaw that he would have
to knock heads.

The two of them lunched in the pilot's cabin, with hardly room to drop a
spoon. Except for companionship, Mayne would as soon have eaten standing
in the galley.

He considered the vast area of the planet's land surface. Would it be
wiser for the envoy to land elsewhere? What sort of ties were there
between tribes?

"Loose," the pilot told him. "Still, word gets around, with no great

lot of contact."

"So if the Space Force should seize the _Gemsbok_, they'll all hear
about it?"

Mayne thought it best not to inquire into the nature of the dishes

sun's rays change the smoke on the horizon into gold.

The worst thing about civilization is that it deprives one of the light

We did not answer; his looks remained fixed on a place in the
town.

After some seconds of silence they saw about half a mile away, in
the richer district on the other side of the river, a sort of tragic
fog rearing itself upwards.

A moment afterwards an explosion was heard even where they were sitting,
and an immense tree of smoke mounted towards the pure sky. Little by
little the air was filled with an imperceptible murmur caused by
the shouts of thousands of men. Cries burst forth quite close to the
square.

"What has been blown up?"
The bewilderment was great, for although accidents were common, such a
violent explosion as this one had never been seen, and everybody perceived
that something terribly strange had happened.

Attempts were made to locate the place of the accident; districts,
streets, different buildings, clubs, theatres, and shops were
mentioned.

Information gradually became more precise and at last the truth was
known.

"The Steel Trust has just been blown up."
Clair put his watch back into his pocket.

       

Caroline looked at him closely and her eyes filled with astonishment.

At last she whispered in his ear:

"Did you know it? Were you expecting it? Was it you . . . ?"
He answered very calmly:

"That town ought to be destroyed."
She replied in a gentle and thoughtful tone:

"I think so too."

And both of them returned quietly to their work.

S. 3
From that day onward, anarchist attempts followed one another every
week without interruption. The victims were numerous, and almost
all of them belonged to the poorer classes.

These crimes roused public resentment.

It was among domestic servants, hotel-keepers, and the employees of such
small shops as the Trusts still allowed to exist, that indignation
burst forth most vehemently.

In popular districts women might be heard demanding unusual punishments
for the dynamitards.

(They were called by this old name, although it was hardly appropriate
to them, since, to these unknown chemists, dynamite was an innocent
material only fit to destroy ant-hills, and they considered it mere
child's play to explode nitro-glycerine with a cartridge made of
fulminate of mercury.)

Business ceased suddenly, and those who were least rich were the first
to feel the effects. They spoke of doing justice themselves to the
anarchists.
In the mean time the factory workers remained hostile or indifferent
to violent action.

They were threatened, as a result of the decline of business, with
a likelihood of losing their work, or even a lock-out in all the
factories.

The Federation of Trade Unions proposed a general strike as the most
powerful means of influencing the employers, and the best aid that could
be given to the revolutionists, but all the trades with the exception
of the gliders refused to cease work.

The police made numerous arrests. Troops summoned from all parts of the
National Federation protected the offices of the Trusts, the houses
of the multi-millionaires, the public halls, the banks, and the big
shops.Mayne hurried on.

"This being the case, the Kappans _have absolutely no right_ to deny us
the privilege of contributing all these goods to the glory of their
temple!"

"Oh, boy!" grunted Haruhiku. He rattled off the translation.
