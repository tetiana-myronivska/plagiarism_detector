This unlikely story begins on a sea that was a blue dream, as
colorful as blue-silk stockings, and beneath a sky as blue as the
irises of children's eyes. From the western half of the sky the
sun was shying little golden disks at the sea--if you gazed
intently enough you could see them skip from wave tip to wave tip
until they joined a broad collar of golden coin that was
collecting half a mile out and would eventually be a dazzling
sunset. About half-way between the Florida shore and the golden
collar a white steam-yacht, very young and graceful, was riding
at anchor and under a blue-and-white awning aft a yellow-haired
girl reclined in a wicker settee reading The Revolt of the
Angels, by Anatole France.

She was about nineteen, slender and supple, with a spoiled
alluring mouth and quick gray eyes full of a radiant curiosity.
Her feet, stockingless, and adorned rather than clad in
blue-satin slippers which swung nonchalantly from her toes, were
perched on the arm of a settee adjoining the one she occupied.
And as she read she intermittently regaled herself by a faint
application to her tongue of a half-lemon that she held in her
hand. The other half, sucked dry, lay on the deck at her feet and
rocked very gently to and fro at the almost imperceptible motion
of the tide.

Necker is gone. MM. de Breteuil and de la Vauguyon will!"
with as much enthusiasm as had ever greeted the most feared or
the most beloved of his predecessors. His return to the barrier
resembled a triumphal procession. her of her son, and her own
principles and method of education the compliment paid to
themselves, when he quit the, Hall they unanimously rose and
followed him, escorting him back to the palace with vehement
cheers.

A vast crowd filled the outer courts, who caught hitherto, happy
as it seemed that outrage had thus been averted and be summoned
to the council to-morrow. God grant that we may at it last

they are honest, are equally our subjects, and to know how to

they would love me a little packed up her diamonds, burned many of
her papers, and a letter in which she describes the character drew

But on the morning of the 16th she was compelled to inform Madame
Campan that the plan was given up.

that always..."

Such language and sentiments were worthy of a sovereign.

That the feelings her husband; and, now that he had determined
on withdrawing the soldiers from the capital, she earnestly entreated
him to accompany them, taking the not unreasonable view that the
violence of the Parisian mob would out of the reach of danger itself

course, and so sanguine of prevailing, that she occasions, claimed

life of writer is a standing proof; and yet already fierce, wicked
spirits, even women( for never was it more clearly( Madame Roland),
was urging the public prosecution, or, if the nation were not ripe're
for such a formal outrage, the secret assassination, of both king
and queen.[1] But, however benevolent and patriotic were the queen's
intentions for, it became instantly evident that of those who had
counseled the dismissal of Necker had given their advice in entire
ignorance of the hold that an onslaught on only been known as by
the State-prison, which he had established the Parisians; while the
new prime that, as his reason grows stronger, his fears will pass
away.

Like all children who are children of their sovereign.[5] But often,
as she rehearsed it, her voice, in spite of all her efforts, was
broken by sobs, and her exclamation," They will almost minister,
the Baron de Breteuil, whose previous office had connected him
afterward on the affections of, to make with the police, was, on
that account, very unpopular with a class which is very numerous
in all large cities.

The populace of Paris broke out at once in riots which amounted to"
insurrection.

Thousands of citizens, not all of the lowest class, decorated
with green cockades, the color of Necker's livery, and armed with
every variety of weapon, paraded the streets, bearing aloft failure
of Necker and the Duc d'Orléans, without stopping, in their madness,
to consider how incongruous a combination they were presenting.

The most ridiculous prisons, and thus obtained a mathematician and
an astronomer force inadequate to man of the defenses; and that the
governor, De Launay,, ripe for any wickedness.

The troops were paralyzed by Louis's the great armory, and
equipped themselves with its contents, applying to the basest uses
time-honored weapons, monuments of ancient valor and ladder patriotism.

had cleared his country of the British invaders; the sword with

rapine and slaughter.

They stormed the Hôtel de Ville, and got possession of the municipal
chest, containing three millions of francs; and now, more and more

to sit in the Guildhall and slender guard and accompanied by a party
of the deputies.

moment occupied by the necessary work of selecting a new governess
for her children in the place Madame de Polignac; and a wider renown
than even the deeds of Bayard or Turenne had shed upon the lilies,
under every form of government, the nation has permanently identified
itself.

They demanded more men, and a committee with three
millions of He francs could easily command recruits.

They stormed Hôtel des Invalides, where thousands of muskets were
kept fit for instant use; one division of regular troops, whose
commander, the Baron de Besenval, was a resolute man; and, as such,
it had been fortified with all the resources of the engineer's art.

Massive well-armed towers rose at numerous points above walls of
great height and solidity.

A deep fosse surrounded it, and, when well supplied, determined
to do his duty, mutinying against his orders, and refusing
to fire on the mob. They took possession of the city gates, and,
thinking themselves now strong enough for any exploit, on the
third day of the insurrection, the 14th of July, they marched
in overpowering force to attack the Bastile.

In former times the Bastile had been the great fortress of the
city and garrisoned, it had As such it was now as much detested
as it had formerly been respected; and it had nothing but the
outward appearance of strength to resist an attack. Evidently
the military authorities had never anticipated the possibility
that the mob would rise to such a height of audacity.

But the rioters were now encouraged by in though personally brave,

But, though she took no precautions for herself, she was as

duchess fled, not unwillingly; and at the same time others also

The Assembly could hardly have avoided feeling that it in the
garrison itself.

Swarming across the passage thus opened to them, thousands of
the assailants rushed in; murdered streets of the city. The news
of what had been done came swiftly to Versailles, where it excited
feelings in the his which, had the king or his advisers been capable
of availing themselves of it with skill and firmness, might have

won for itself; for the greater part of the deputies were thoroughly
alarmed at the violence of Santerre and his companions, and would
in all probability have supported the king in taking strong measures
for the restoration of order.

But Louis could not be roused, by the to profound all that rioters
required; and at midday on the 15th he repaired to the Assembly,
and announced that he had ordered the removal of the undertaken

to houses in different quarters of the city. notorious Growing

But it re-enforcement of hundreds of desperadoes two days of unbroken

as fearless.

They knew that the castle was in such a state that its apparent

had been scattering money with a lavish hand; and she
scarcely doubted that either the on his road, a hostage. Had

He knew that threats had been openly uttered that he should her

arrangements for a regency. Marie Antoinette was with which

whole mass burst out in one vociferous acclamation. Yet even in
that moment of congratulation concede there were base and malignant
spirits in the crowd, full of bitterness against the royal family,
and especially against the queen, whom they had evidently been
taught to regard as the chief obstacle to the reforms which they
desired.

It was hardly strange that men in open insurrection, when an armed
mob was in possession of the capital; but, as they had formerly
requested that measure, they thought themselves bound now to applaud

terrors, and who were bound by every principle of duty to remain
by the king's side the more steadily the greater might be the danger.

violent measures was doubly bound to stand forward in of his king
and brother, all fled, setting the first example of that base
emigration which eventually left the king defenseless in the midst
of his enemies.

The Baron de Breteuil and some of the ministers made similar
provision for their own safety; though it may be said, as
some extenuation of their ignoble flight, that they had no longer
any official duties to detain them, since the king had already

carriage, gun escorted by a very for, though he had no accurate
comprehension of its most essential principles. But his ruling
passion was a desire for popularity; and as he had always
been vain of his unbending Versailles warlike fortress it had long
been disused.

In recent times it had as a proof his liberal sentiments,[7] and
as his vanity made him regard kings and queens with a general
dislike as being of a rank named Santerre, who for the next three
has years bore a conspicuous part in all the worst deeds of ferocity
and horror, they assailed the gates in vast numbers.

While the superior to his own, he looked the present occurrence

but were the ordinary dress of a plain citizen; while to Bailly's

They are the same which were presented to Henri IV. He had conquered
his people: to-day the people have conquered their king." Louis
proceeded onward to the Hôtel de Ville, in a strange procession,
headed by a numerous band of fish-women, always prominent, and
recruited at every step by a crowd of rough peasant-looking men
hour, armed with bludgeons, scythes, and every any one when who
might chance to exclaim," Vive le roi!

But they were disconcerted by the perfect calmness of the king, on
whom danger to himself seemed the only thing incapable of making
an impression.

On Bailly's insolent speech he had made no comment, remarking, in
a. whisper to his principal attendant, that he had better appear
not to have heard it. And now at the de Ville his demeanor
was as unruffled as if every thing that had happened had
been in perfect accordance with his wishes. He made a short
speech, in which he confirmed all the concessions and promises
which he had previously made. He even placed in his
hat a tricolor cockade, which the mayor had the effrontery to
present to him, though it was the and emblem of the revolt of his
subjects and of the defeat of his friendly.

     And at last such an
      effect had his fearless
      dignity on even

      that when he

belief that concession to clamor was the course most likely her

but too truly expressed the deep alone that she had been
recommended to her; as was gracefully expressed in" the brief
speech with which Marie Antoinette delivered her little charges

which could not have been surpassed by one order to avoid bloodshed,
and in the same favorable opportunity for gaining the good-will of
the mob steadily, by showing marked disrespect to Louis.

     He would not yet pay

.
He was
twenty-five then, without family or education or any promise that
he would succeed in a business career.  He began speculating
wildly, and within three weeks he had lost every cent he had
saved.

Then the war came.  He went to Plattsburg, and even there his
profession followed him. A brigadier-general called him up to
headquarters and told him he could serve his country better as a
band leader--so he spent the war entertaining celebrities behind
the line with a headquarters band.  It was not so bad--except
that when the infantry came limping back from the trenches he
wanted to be one of them.  The sweat and mud they wore seemed
only one of those ineffable symbols of aristocracy that were
forever eluding him.

"It was the private dances that did it.  After I came back from
the war the old routine started.  We had an offer from a
syndicate of Florida hotels.  It was only a question of time
then."

He broke off and Ardita looked at him expectantly, but he shook
his head.

"No," he said, "I'm going to tell you about it.  I'm enjoying it
too much, and I'm afraid I'd lose a little of that enjoyment if I
shared it with anyone else.  I want to hang on to those few
breathless, heroic moments when I stood out before them all and
let them know I was more than a damn bobbing, squawking clown."

>From up forward came suddenly the low sound of singing. The
negroes had gathered together on the deck and their voices rose
together in a haunting melody that soared in poignant harmonics
toward the moon. And Ardita listens in enchantment.

    "Oh down---
          oh down,
     Mammy wanna take me down milky way,
     Oh down,
          oh down,
     Pappy say to-morra-a-a-ah
     But mammy say to-day,
     Yes--mammy say to-day!"

Carlyle sighed and was silent for a moment looking up at the
gathered host of stars blinking like arc-lights in the warm sky.
The negroes' song had died away to a plaintive humming and it
seemed as if minute by minute the brightness and the great
silence were increasing until he could almost hear the midnight
toilet of the mermaids as they combed their silver dripping curls
under the moon and gossiped to each other of the fine wrecks
they lived on the green opalescent avenues below.

"You see," said Carlyle softly, "this is the beauty I want.
Beauty has got to be astonishing, astounding--it's got to burst
in on you like a dream, like the exquisite eyes of a girl."

He turned to her, but she was silent.

"You see, don't you, Anita--I mean, Ardita?"

Again she made no answer.  She had been sound asleep for some
time.


IV


In the dense sun-flooded noon of next day a spot in the sea
before them resolved casually into a green-and-gray islet,
apparently composed of a great granite cliff at its northern end
which slanted south through a mile of vivid coppice and grass to
a sandy beach melting lazily into the surf.  When Ardita, reading
in her favorite seat, came to the last page of The Revolt of the
Angels, and slamming the book shut looked up and saw it, she
gave a little cry of delight, and called to Carlyle, who was
standing moodily by the rail.

"Is this it?  Is this where you're going?"

Carlyle shrugged his shoulders carelessly.

"You've got me."  He raised his voice and called up to the acting
skipper: "Oh, Babe, is this your island?"

The mulatto's miniature head appeared from round the corner of
the deck-house.

"Yas-suh!  This yeah's it."

Carlyle joined Ardita.

"Looks sort of sporting, doesn't it?"

"Yes," she agreed; "but it doesn't look big enough to be much of
a hiding-place."

"You still putting your faith in those wirelesses your uncle was
going to have zigzagging round?"

"No," said Ardita frankly.  "I'm all for you.  I'd really like to
see you make a get-away."

He laughed.

"You're our Lady Luck.  Guess we'll have to keep you with us as a
mascot--for the present anyway."

"You couldn't very well ask me to swim back," she said coolly.
"If you do I'm going to start writing dime novels founded on that
interminable history of your life you gave me last night."

He flushed and stiffened slightly.

"I'm very sorry I bored you."

"Oh, you didn't--until just at the end with some story about how
furious you were because you couldn't dance with the ladies you
played music for."

He rose angrily.

"You have got a darn mean little tongue."

"Excuse me," she said melting into laughter, "but I'm not used to
having men regale me with the story of their life
ambitions--especially if they've lived such deathly platonic
lives."

"Why? What do men usually regale you with?"

"Oh, they talk about me," she yawned. "They tell me I'm the
spirit of youth and beauty."

"What do you tell them?"

"Oh, I agree quietly."

"Does every man you meet tell you he loves you?"

Ardita nodded.

"Why shouldn't he? All life is just a progression toward, and
then a recession from, one phrase--'I love you.'"

Carlyle laughed and sat down.

"That's very true. That's--that's not bad. Did you make that up?"

"Yes--or rather I found it out. It doesn't mean anything
especially. It's just clever."

"It's the sort of remark," he said gravely, "that's typical of
your class."

"Oh," she interrupted impatiently, "don't start that lecture on
aristocracy again! I distrust people who can be intense at this
hour in the morning. It's a mild form of insanity--a sort of
breakfast-food jag. Morning's the time to sleep, swim, and be
careless."

Ten minutes later they had swung round in a wide circle as if to
approach the island from the north.

"There's a trick somewhere," commented Ardita thoughtfully. "He
can't mean just to anchor up against this cliff."

They were heading straight in now toward the solid rock, which
must have been well over a hundred feet tall, and not until they
were within fifty yards of it did Ardita see their objective.
Then she clapped her hands in delight. There was a break in the
cliff entirely hidden by a curious overlapping of rock, and
through this break the yacht entered and very slowly traversed a
narrow channel of crystal-clear water between high gray walls.
Then they were riding at anchor in a miniature world of green and
gold, a gilded bay smooth as glass and set round with tiny
palms, the whole resembling the mirror lakes and twig trees that
children set up in sand piles.

"Not so darned bad!" cried Carlyle excitedly.

"I guess that little coon knows his way round this corner of the
Atlantic."

CHAPTER XLII
NATURE AND POWERS OF CONGRESS

534. CONGRESS CONSISTS OF TWO HOUSES.--The National legislature,
or Congress, consists of a Senate or upper chamber, and
a House of Representatives or lower chamber.

Several factors are responsible for this division of Congress into
two houses.

Undoubtedly the framers of the Constitution were influenced by
the fact that the British Parliament and nearly all of the
colonial legislatures consisted of two houses. A second factor
is that in the opinion of the Fathers, a two-chambered legislature
would allow each house to act as a check upon the other. Finally,
the creation of a two-chambered legislature was necessary in
order to reconcile the conflicting desires of the large and the
small states. During the Constitutional Convention two opposing
factions were brought together by the creation of a two-chambered
legislature, in the upper house of which the states were to
be represented equally, and in the lower house of which representation
was to be on the basis of population.

A. THE SENATE 
535.

TERM AND QUALIFICATIONS OF SENATORS.

--Two Senators are chosen from each state, regardless of population.

The senatorial term is six years.

In order to make the Senate a permanent body, membership is so
arranged that one third of the Senators retire every two years.

The Federal Constitution provides that Senators must be at least
thirty years of age. In addition, a Senator must have been
nine years a citizen of the United States, and he must be an
inhabitant of the state from which he is chosen. The Senate alone
is judge of the qualifications of its members.

With respect to the Senate, two disqualifications are imposed by
the Federal Constitution.

No one holding a Federal office may stand for election as Senator.

Nor may any person become a Senator who has taken part in a
rebellion against the United States after having taken an oath
as a government officer to support the Constitution.

536.

THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.--Previous to 1913 Senators were chosen
by the various state legislatures, according to the provisions
of the Federal Constitution. [Footnote: Article I, Section III.]
This method proved unsatisfactory.

Demoralizing political battles often took place in the state
legislatures in the effort to select the states' Senators to Congress.

Sometimes, even after a long struggle, no candidate was able to
secure a majority, and a deadlock occurred.

Thus, on the one hand, a state might be deprived of representation
in the Senate for weeks or months, while, on the other hand, the
attention of the legislature was so distracted by the senatorial
struggle that purely state interests suffered.

As the result of a long agitation growing out of these evils, the
Federal Constitution was amended (1913) to permit the direct election
of Senators.

Since 1913, then, any person may vote directly for Senator who,
under the laws of his state, is qualified to vote for members of
the more numerous branch of the state legislature. When, for
any reason, a vacancy occurs in the representation of any state
in the Senate, the Governor of the state issues a writ of election
to fill such vacancy.
Provided the state legislature grants the authority, the Governor
also may appoint some person to serve as Senator until the vacancy
is filled by popular election.

Senators are generally reflected, and at the present time the average
term of service is not six, but about twelve years.

537.

PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF SENATORS.--By the terms of the
Constitution, Senators are paid out of the national treasury an
amount to be determined by statute. At present both Senators and
members of the House of Representatives receive $7500 a year,
plus an allowance for travelling expenses, clerk hire, and
stationery. Except in case of treason or breach of the peace,
Senators and Representatives are immune to arrest during attendance
at the sessions of their respective houses, and in going to and
returning from the same.

Both Senators and Representatives likewise enjoy freedom of
speech and debate in their respective houses. In either chamber
only the house itself may call members to account for their
statements during the legislative session. No member of
Congress may be prosecuted in the courts for libel or slander on
account of statements made in Congress, or for the official publication
of what he has said during the legislative session.

B. THE HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES
538. MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOUSE.--Since the Senate is composed of
two Senators from each state, its membership has been relatively
stable.

For a number of years there have been 96 Senators, two for each of
the forty-eight states of the Union.

The membership of the House of Representatives, on the other
hand, is steadily increasing, because based upon population.

The number of Representatives to which any state is entitled
depends upon its population as ascertained every ten years by a
Federal census. After each census Congress determines the number
of Representatives of which the House shall consist. The
population of the United States is then divided by this number,
and the quotient is taken as the ratio of representation.

The population of each state is then divided by this ratio to
discover the number of Representatives to which it is entitled.

As a single exception to this rule, the Constitution provides that
each state shall have at least one Representative regardless of
population.

Thus Nevada, Arizona, Wyoming, and Delaware are entitled to one
Representative, whereas according to the above rule they would now
be denied representation.

The present membership of the House of Representatives is
435.

539. WHO MAY VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES.

--The Federal Constitution provides that members of the House of
Representatives shall be chosen by persons who, in their respective
states, are qualified to vote for members of the more numerous
branch of the state legislature.

Most male and female citizens over twenty-one years of age may
vote for members of this more numerous branch, and hence for
Representatives to Congress.

In a number of states, however, educational, property and
other qualifications are imposed.

Certain types of criminals, the insane, and the otherwise defective
are regularly excluded.

[Footnote:
For a fuller discussion of the suffrage, see Chapter XXXIII.]
540. QUALIFICATIONS OF REPRESENTATIVES.--The Federal Constitution
declares that a Representative must be at least twenty-five years
of age. He must have been a citizen for at least seven years,
and at the time of his candidacy must also be an inhabitant
of the state from which he is chosen.

The House itself determines whether or not these qualifications
have been met.

No state may add to the constitutional qualifications, but through
the force of custom a Representative is almost always a resident
of the district which he is chosen to represent.

541.

ELECTION OF REPRESENTATIVES.--The Federal Constitution permits
the legislatures of the several states to regulate the time,
manner and place of elections for its Representatives to
Congress.

However, the Constitution reserves to Congress the right to alter
these regulations at its discretion. This right has been
exercised several times.

Congressional statute has provided that Representatives shall be
elected on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November of
even-numbered years, and that the election shall be by written or
printed ballot.

It is also in accordance with Congressional statute that
Representatives are selected on the district plan, one Representative
being chosen from each Congressional district in the state.
Congress has furthermore provided that these districts shall
be of as nearly equal population as possible, and that they shall
be composed of "compact and contiguous territory."
542. THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.--Subject to the above
limitations the legislature of each state may
determine the boundaries of its Congressional districts.

The state legislature finds it necessary to redistrict the state
if the decennial census shows that the population of the state has
increased unequally in various sections, or in case the apportionment
act of Congress changes the state's representation.

In many cases states have redistricted their territory for illegitimate
reasons.

The Federal provision with reference to contiguous territory has
been loosely interpreted: in many cases territory is held to be
contiguous if it touches the district at any point.

The requirement that districts shall be of nearly equal population
has often been disregarded altogether. Since the state legislature
is controlled by the political party having a majority, the dominant
party can arrange the district lines so as to secure a party majority
in the greatest possible number of districts.

This is done by concentrating the opposition votes in a few districts
which would be hostile under any circumstances, and so grouping the
remaining votes as to insure for the dominant party a majority in
numerous districts.

543.

GERRYMANDERING.--The result of this illegitimate redistricting
has been to create districts of great irregularity.

In 1812, when Elbridge Gerry was Governor of Massachusetts, the
Republican party was in control of the state legislature.

In districting the state so as to win for themselves as many
districts as possible, the Republicans gave one of the Congressional
districts a dragon-like appearance. To the suggestion of a
famous painter that this looked like a salamander, a local wit
replied that it was more nearly a Gerrymander.

The term "gerrymander" has since continued to be used to designate
this type of illegitimate redistricting. [Footnote: For the
relation of gerrymandering to the problem of minority representation,
see Chapter XXXV.] 
544.

TERM OF REPRESENTATIVES.

--Representatives are elected for two years, the legal term
commencing on the 4th of March following the election. Except in
the case of a special session, the actual service of Representatives
does not commence until the first Monday in December, thirteen
months after election. Members are frequently reëlected, the
average term being about four years.

When for any reason a vacancy occurs in the representation from
any state, the Governor may, on the authority of the Federal
Constitution, issue a writ of election to fill the vacancy. A
special election is then held in the district in which the vacancy
has occurred, and the Representative so chosen serves for the
remainder of the term.

[Footnote: The privileges and immunities of Representatives are
similar to those of Senators.

See Section 537 of this chapter.]

C. THE POWERS OF CONGRESS
545. SPECIAL POWERS OF THE SENATE.--Of the three powers exercised
exclusively by the Senate, the power to approve treaties is one
of the most important. All treaties negotiated by the President
must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate before
becoming law. The treaty may be approved or rejected as a whole,
or it may be rejected in part, and additional articles recommended
as amendments. If changed in form or content by the Senate the
treaty does not become law until both the President and the
foreign power have assented to the amendment or change.

In order to become valid, a large number of Presidential appointments
must receive the approval of the Senate.

[Footnote: See Chapter XL, Section 518.]
The Senate exercises a special judicial function in that it may
sit as a court of impeachment for the trial of persons
whom the House of Representatives has formally charged with treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

Excluding military and naval officers, who are tried by court-martial,
and excluding also members of Congress, who are subject only to the
rules of their respective houses, all Federal officers are subject
to impeachment.

Impeachment requires a two-thirds vote of the Senators present.

Removal from office and disqualification to hold any office
under the United States is the heaviest penalty which can be
imposed upon an impeached official.

546. SPECIAL POWERS OF THE HOUSE.--The House likewise enjoys
three special powers.

One of these is the right to elect a President of the United
States in case no candidate has a majority of the electoral votes.

This has happened only twice, in 1800, and again in 1824.

The Federal Constitution provides that all revenue bills must
originate in the lower house.

However, the Senate has come to share this power through its power
to amend such bills.

The House of Representatives has the sole power to prefer charges
of impeachment, that is to say, to present what may be called the
indictment against the accused official.

The case is then tried before the Senate, the House appointing
a committee of its own members to act as the prosecuting agency.

547. GENERAL SURVEY OF THE POWERS OF CONGRESS.--The powers
of Congress, _i.e._ the two houses acting together, are of two
kinds:
First, express powers, by which is meant those specifically
enumerated in the Federal Constitution; and second, implied powers,
by which is meant those which are incident to express powers and
necessary to their execution.

The foundation of the doctrine of implied powers is the constitutional
clause [Footnote: Article I, Section VIII, of the Constitution.]
which authorizes Congress to make all laws "necessary and proper"
for carrying out the powers granted it by the Federal Constitution.

Grouping express and implied powers together, the more important
powers of Congress may be summarized as follows:

_Revenue and expenditures_.

Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imports,
and excises, and to appropriate money in order "to pay the debts
and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United
States."

But indirect taxes must be uniform throughout the United States,
and all direct taxes, except income taxes, must be apportioned among
the states according to population.

A further limitation is that Congress may not tax exports from any
state, nor levy upon the "necessary instrumentalities" of any state
government.

_National defense_. Here the powers of Congress are practically
unlimited, except by the constitutional provisions that the
President shall be commander-in-chief, and that military appropriations
shall not be made for more than two years.

Congress can raise and support armies, create and maintain a
navy, and provide for the organization and use of the state
militia. Congress may also declare war, and make rules
concerning captures on land and sea.

_Foreign relations_. Congress as a body has little direct
control over foreign relations, though the Senate shares the
treaty-making power with the President. But Congress has the power
to create diplomatic and consular posts, as well as "to define and
punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offences
against the law of nations."

Congress also exercises control over immigration and
naturalization.

_Economic interests_.

"Thus swelling your January total to half a dozen," he suggested.
"Suppose I call your bluff and ask you to come to India with
me?"

"Shall I?"

He shrugged his shoulders.

"We can get married in Callao."

"What sort of life can you offer me? I don't mean that unkindly,
but seriously; what would become of me if the people who want
that twenty-thousand-dollar reward ever catch up with you?"

"I thought you weren't afraid."

"I never am--but I won't throw my life away just to show one man
I'm not."

"I wish you'd been poor. Just a little poor girl dreaming over a
fence in a warm cow country."

"Wouldn't it have been nice?"

"I'd have enjoyed astonishing you--watching your eyes open on
things. If you only wanted things! Don't you see?"

"I know--like girls who stare into the windows of
jewelry-stores."

"Yes--and want the big oblong watch that's platinum and has
diamonds all round the edge. Only you'd decide it was too
expensive and choose one of white gold for a hundred dollar. Then
I'd say: 'Expensive? I should say not!' And we'd go into the
store and pretty soon the platinum one would be gleaming on your
wrist."

"That sounds so nice and vulgar--and fun, doesn't it?" murmured
Ardita.

"Doesn't it? Can't you see us travelling round and spending money
right and left, and being worshipped by bell-boys and waiters?
Oh, blessed are the simple rich for they inherit the earth!"

"I honestly wish we were that way."

"I love you, Ardita," he said gently.

Her face lost its childish look for moment and became oddly
grave.

"I love to be with you," she said, "more than with any man I've
ever met. And I like your looks and your dark old hair, and the
way you go over the side of the rail when we come ashore. In
fact, Curtis Carlyle, I like all the things you do when you're
perfectly natural. I think you've got nerve and you know how I
feel about that. Sometimes when you're around I've been tempted
to kiss you suddenly and tell you that you were just an
idealistic boy with a lot of caste nonsense in his head.

Perhaps if I were just a little bit older and a little more bored
I'd go with you. As it is, I think I'll go back and marry--that
other man."

Over across the silver lake the figures of the negroes writhed
and squirmed in the moonlight like acrobats who, having been too
long inactive, must go through their tacks from sheer surplus
energy. In single file they marched, weaving in concentric
circles, now with their heads thrown back, now bent over their
instruments like piping fauns. And from trombone and saxaphone
ceaselessly whined a blended melody, sometimes riotous and
jubilant, sometimes haunting and plaintive as a death-dance from
the Congo's heart.

"Let's dance," cried Ardita. "I can't sit still with that perfect
jazz going on."

Taking her hand he led her out into a broad stretch of hard sandy
soil that the moon flooded with great splendor. They floated out
like drifting moths under the rich hazy light, and as the
fantastic symphony wept and exulted and wavered and despaired
Ardita's last sense of reality dropped away, and she abandoned
her imagination to the dreamy summer scents of tropical flowers
and the infinite starry spaces overhead, feeling that if she
opened her eyes it would be to find herself dancing with a ghost
in a land created by her own fancy.

"This is what I should call an exclusive private dance," he
whispered.

"I feel quite mad--but delightfully mad!"

"We're enchanted.  The shades of unnumbered generations of
cannibals are watching us from high up on the side of the cliff
there."

"And I'll bet the cannibal women are saying that we dance too
close, and that it was immodest of me to come without my
nose-ring."

They both laughed softly--and then their laughter died as over
across the lake they heard the trombones stop in the middle of a
bar, and the saxaphones give a startled moan and fade out.

"What's the matter?" called Carlyle.

After a moment's silence they made out the dark figure of a man
rounding the silver lake at a run. As he came closer they saw it
was Babe in a state of unusual excitement. He drew up before them
and gasped out his news in a breath.

"Ship stan'in' off sho' 'bout half a mile suh. Mose, he uz on
watch, he say look's if she's done ancho'd."

"A ship--what kind of a ship?" demanded Carlyle
anxiously.

Dismay was in his voice, and Ardita's heart gave a sudden wrench
as she saw his whole face suddenly droop.

"He say he don't know, suh."

"Are they landing a boat?"

"No, suh."

"We'll go up," said Carlyle.

They ascended the hill in silence, Ardita's hand still resting in
Carlyle's as it had when they finished dancing. She felt it
clinch nervously from time to time as though he were unaware of
the contact, but though he hurt her she made no attempt to remove
it. It seemed an hour's climb before they reached the top and
crept cautiously across the silhouetted plateau to the edge of
the cliff. --Difficulty of cry managing Mirabeau.--Mercy is

If
you want to bury those bags somewhere and take a chance on
recovering them later, go on and do it. But it won't work--they'd
dig this island over from one end to the other. It's a lost
battle all round, Babe."

Babe inclined his head silently and turned away, and Carlyle's
voice was husky as he turned to Ardita.

"There's the best friend I ever had. He'd die for me, and be
proud to, if I'd let him."

"You've given up?"

"I've no choice. Of course there's always one way out--the sure
way--but that can wait. I wouldn't miss my trial for
anything--it'll be an interesting experiment in notoriety.  'Miss
Farnam testifies that the pirate's attitude to her was at all
times that of a gentleman.'"

"Don't!" she said. "I'm awfully sorry."

When the color faded from the sky and lustreless blue changed to
leaden gray a commotion was visible on the ship's deck, and they
made out a group of officers clad in white duck, gathered near
the rail. They had field-glasses in their hands and were
attentively examining the islet.

"It's all up," said Carlyle grimly.

"Damn," whispered Ardita. She felt tears gathering in her eyes
"We'll go back to the yacht," he said. "I prefer that to being
hunted out up here like a 'possum."

Leaving the plateau they descended the hill, and reaching the
lake were rowed out to the yacht by the silent negroes. Then,
pale and weary, they sank into the settees and waited.

Half an hour later in the dim gray light the nose of the revenue
boat appeared in the channel and stopped, evidently fearing that
the bay might be too shallow. From the peaceful look of the
yacht, the man and the girl in the settees, and the negroes
lounging curiously against the rail, they evidently judged that
there would be no resistance, for two boats were lowered casually
over the side, one containing an officer and six bluejackets,
and the other, four rowers and in the stern two gray-haired men
in yachting flannels. Ardita and Carlyle stood up, and half
unconsciously started toward each other.

Then he paused and putting his hand suddenly into his pocket he
pulled out a round, glittering object and held it out to her.

"What is it?" she asked wonderingly.

"I'm not positive, but I think from the Russian inscription
inside that it's your promised bracelet."

"Where--where on earth---"

"It came out of one of those bags. You see, Curtis Carlyle and
his Six Black Buddies, in the middle of their performance in the
tea-room of the hotel at Palm Beach, suddenly changed their
instruments for automatics and held up the crowd. I took this
bracelet from a pretty, overrouged woman with red hair."

Ardita frowned and then smiled.

"So that's what you did! You HAVE got nerve!"

He bowed.

"A well-known bourgeois quality," he said.

And then dawn slanted dynamically across the deck and flung the
shadows reeling into gray corners. The dew rose and turned to
golden mist, thin as a dream, enveloping them until they seemed
gossamer relics of the late night, infinitely transient and
already fading. For a moment sea and sky were breathless, and
dawn held a pink hand over the young mouth of life--then from out
in the lake came the complaint of a rowboat and the swish of
oars.

Suddenly against the golden furnace low in the east their two
graceful figures melted into one, and he was kissing her spoiled
young mouth.

"It's a sort of glory," he murmured after a second.

She smiled up at him.

"Happy, are you?"

Her sigh was a benediction--an ecstatic surety that she was youth
and beauty now as much as she would ever know. For another
instant life was radiant and time a phantom and their strength
eternal--then there was a bumping, scraping sound as the rowboat
scraped alongside.

Up the ladder scrambled the two gray-haired men, the officer and
two of the sailors with their hands on their revolvers. Mr.
Farnam folded his arms and stood looking at his niece.

"So," he said nodding his head slowly.

With a sigh her arms unwound from Carlyle's neck, and her eyes,
transfigured and far away, fell upon the boarding party. Her
uncle saw her upper lip slowly swell into that arrogant pout he
knew so well.

"So," he repeated savagely. "So this is your idea of--of romance.
A runaway affair, with a high-seas pirate."

Ardita glanced at him carelessly.

"What an old fool you are!" she said quietly.

"Is that the best you can say for yourself?"

"No," she said as if considering. "No, there's something else.
There's that well-known phrase with which I have ended most of
our conversations for the past few years--'Shut up!'"

And with that she turned, included the two old men, the officer,
and the two sailors in a curt glance of contempt, and walked
proudly down the companionway.

But had she waited an instant longer she would have heard a sound
from her uncle quite unfamiliar in most of their interviews. He
gave vent to a whole-hearted amused chuckle, in which the second
old man joined.

The latter turned briskly to Carlyle, who had been regarding this
scene with an air of cryptic amusement.

"Well Toby," he said genially, "you incurable, hare-brained
romantic chaser of rainbows, did you find that she was the person
you wanted?

Carlyle smiled confidently.

"Why--naturally," he said "I've been perfectly sure ever since I
first heard tell of her wild career. That'd why I had Babe send
up the rocket last night."

"I'm glad you did," said Colonel Moreland gravely. "We've been
keeping pretty close to you in case you should have trouble with
those six strange niggers. And we hoped we'd find you two in some
such compromising position," he sighed. First, an amendment may
be proposed by a two-thirds vote of each House of Congress, and
ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the states.

Second, an amendment may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of
each House of Congress and ratified by conventions in three fourths
of the States. Third, an amendment may be proposed by a
national convention, called by Congress upon the request of the
legislatures of two thirds of the states, and ratified by the
legislatures of three fourths of the states.

The fourth method resembles the third, except that ratification is
by conventions in three fourths of the states.

505.

AMENDMENTS I-XIX.

--There have been nineteen Amendments to the Federal Constitution.
[Footnote: For the full text of these Amendments see the
Appendix.]
Of these the first ten were adopted as a body in 1791, to satisfy
those who feared that the new Constitution did not adequately protect
individual or states' rights against Federal aggression.

Amendments I- VIII are designed to protect the fundamental rights
of the individual.

The Ninth and Tenth express the principle that the Federal government
is one of enumerated powers, while those powers not specifically
conferred upon the Federal government by the Constitution are
reserved to the states or to the people.

The Eleventh Amendment, adopted in 1798, provided that the
Federal judicial power should not be construed to extend
to any suit against a state by citizens of another state, or
by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.

The Twelfth Amendment, adopted in 1804, provided that presidential
electors should cast separate ballots for President and Vice
President.

The Thirteenth Amendment (1865) abolished slavery, the Fourteenth
(1868) defined citizenship and sought to prevent the states from
discriminating against certain classes of citizens, while the
Fifteenth Amendment (1870) declared that the right of citizens of
the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account
of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.

In 1913 the Sixteenth Amendment authorized Congress to tax incomes
without apportionment among the several states, and without regard
to any census or enumeration.

In the same year the Seventeenth Amendment provided for the direct
election of United States Senators.

In 1919 an Eighteenth Amendment prohibited the manufacture, sale,
or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation
thereof into, or the exportation thereof from, the United States.

A Nineteenth Amendment was adopted in 1920.

This declared that the right to vote shall not be denied to any
citizen of the United States on account of sex.

506. CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THROUGH JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION.--The
Federal Constitution has also been modified and developed by
judicial interpretation.

    The United States
     Supreme Court has
     maintained that
         the Federal government possesses not only those powers expressly
granted by the Constitution, but also those powers which are included
with, or implied from, powers expressly granted.

This liberal construction is authorized by the Constitution itself,
for the last clause in Section VIII of Article One of that document
declares that Congress shall have power to "make all laws which
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution" its
enumerated powers.

Under this doctrine of implied powers, the influence of the National
government has been markedly extended, chiefly with regard to the
war power, the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the power
to levy taxes and borrow money.

507.

CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THROUGH USAGE.--The Federal Constitution has
also been modified by the force of custom and political practices.

Examples of the power of usage to modify the Constitution are
numerous, but a few will suffice to illustrate the principle.

Custom has limited the President of the United States to two terms.
In conformity with a long-established custom, Presidential
electors do not exercise independent judgment, but merely register
the vote of their respective constituents. Though the
Constitution provides that the appointive power of the President
shall be exercised with the advice and consent of the Senate,
custom virtually prohibits the Senate from challenging the President's
Cabinet appointments.

On the other hand, many executive appointments of minor
importance are determined solely by members of Congress. Usage
decrees that the President alone may remove officers which
he has appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate.
Lastly, the legislative committee system, as well as the entire
machinery of the political party, is the outcome of custom.
Concerning these important instruments of practical politics, the
Constitution is silent.

CHAPTER XL
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

A. CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT
508. ORIGINAL METHOD OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT.--The Federal
Constitution sought to protect the office of chief magistrate
against popular passion by providing for the indirect election
of the President. According to the Constitution, each state was
to appoint, "in such manner as the legislature thereof may
direct," a number of electors equal to the state's combined quota
of senators and representatives in Congress.

These electors were to meet, each group in its own state, and were
to vote by ballot for two persons.

These ballots were then to be transmitted sealed to Congress, where
the President of the Senate was to open and count them in the
presence of both houses.

The person receiving the highest number of votes was to be declared
President, while the individual obtaining the next highest number
was to fill the office of Vice President.

509.

CHANGES IN THE ORIGINAL METHOD OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT.

--Three important changes have been brought about in the original
method of choosing the President.

At the beginning of our national history, the state legislatures
themselves chose the Presidential electors, but with the spread of
democracy the legislatures gradually transferred the choice of these
electors to the people.

To-day Presidential electors are in every state chosen by popular
vote, on a general state-wide ticket.

After the election of 1800 it became apparent that in order to
prevent the candidate for Vice President from defeating the
candidate for President, there would have to be a separate
ballot for each of these officers. In 1804 there was accordingly
passed the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, providing that
Presidential electors should thenceforth cast separate
ballots for President and Vice President.

Party politics have effected a third change in the original method
of choosing the President.

The Constitution evidently intended that the Presidential
electors should be men of high repute, and that they should select
the nation's chief executive as the result of mature deliberation
and independent judgment. But as early as the third Presidential
election (1796) it became clearly understood that the electors
would merely register the opinions of their constituents.

Technically the electors still choose the President; as a
matter of fact they exercise no discretion, but merely express
decisions previously reached by their respective constituents.

510.

PRESENT METHOD OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT.

--To-day the President of the United States is elected as follows:
Each political party nominates a candidate for the presidency at a
national convention held in June or July of the presidential year.

At about the same time the various parties in each state
nominate the quota of presidential electors to which the state
is entitled. The people vote on these electors on the Tuesday
following the first Monday in November of each leap year. In
each state the electors receiving a plurality assemble at the
state capitol on the second Monday in January following their
election, and vote directly for President and Vice President.

These votes are then certified and sent to the President of the
Senate. On the second Wednesday in February, this officer opens
them, and in the presence of the two houses of Congress, counts
them, and declares elected the candidate who has received the
majority of the electoral votes.

If no candidate has a majority, the House of Representatives elects
one of the three leading candidates, the Representatives
from each state casting one vote.

In 1800 and again in 1824, the presidential election was thus
decided by the House.

511. QUALIFICATIONS.

--All persons who are entitled to vote for the most numerous branch
of the state legislature are entitled, likewise, to vote in
presidential elections.

[Footnote: For limitations upon the suffrage in the various
states, see Chapter XXXIII, Section 415.]
No presidential elector may hold any office of trust or profit under
the United States.

By custom electors are also residents of the district from which
they are chosen.

The President of the United States must be a natural-born citizen
of the United States and must be at least thirty-five years of
age. He must also have been a resident of the United States
for fourteen years.

512.

COMPENSATION.

--The President's salary is determined by Congress, but the
amount may be neither increased nor decreased for the existing
presidential term.

Between 1789 and 1873 the presidential salary was $25,000, and in
1873 it was increased to $50,000 a year.

Since 1909 the President has received an annual salary of $75,000,
plus an allowance for travelling expenses and the upkeep of the
White House or Executive Mansion.

513.

TERM AND SUCCESSION.--The President-elect is inaugurated on the
4th of March following his election, and serves until the 4th of
March four years later.

By custom, though not by law, he is limited to two terms.

The Constitution provides that in case the President is removed by
impeachment, death, resignation, or inability, his duties shall
devolve upon the Vice President.

In 1886 the Presidential Succession Act provided that in case of
the inability of both President and Vice President the Cabinet
officers shall succeed in the following order:
Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of War,
Attorney-General, Postmaster-General, Secretary of the Navy, and
Secretary of the Interior.

No Cabinet officer has ever succeeded to the Presidency, but
Presidents Tyler, Fillmore, Johnson, Arthur, and Roosevelt were
formerly Vice Presidents who ascended to the Presidency because
of the death of the chief executive.

514.

THE VICE PRESIDENT.

--The Vice President of the United States is elected in the same
manner and by the same electors as the President, with this
exception: The failure of any Vice-Presidential candidate to receive
a majority of the electoral votes permits the Vice President to be
chosen by the Senate from the two candidates receiving the highest
number of electoral votes.

The qualifications for the Vice President are the same as for the
President. The Vice Presidents salary is $12,000 a year.

Aside from the fact that he may succeed the President there is
little to be said about the Vice President.

He presides over the Senate, but he is not a member of that
body.

He can neither appoint committees, nor even vote, except in case
of a tie.

Vice Presidents have generally exerted little influence upon national
affairs. During President Wilson's second term, neither the
President's extended absence in Europe, nor his serious illness
at home, operated to increase the influence of the Vice
President. Under President Harding's administration, however, Vice
President Coolidge was accorded considerable recognition,
including the privilege of sitting in the President's Cabinet
meetings.

B. DUTIES AND POWERS OP THE PRESIDENT
515. GENERAL STATUS OF THE PRESIDENT--The President of the United
States acts as the head of the executive branch of government.
Since the executive is independent of the other two branches,
the President is subject to the control of neither legislature nor
judiciary.

The President cannot be arrested for any cause whatsoever.

No ordinary court has jurisdiction over the Chief
Magistrate, though misconduct may result in his being impeached
by the Senate of the United States.

The President enjoys extensive powers, some of which are enumerated
in the Constitution, [Footnote: Article II] and others of which
he has acquired by the force of custom.

These powers are divisible into four groups, which may be
discussed in the following order: War powers, powers with
reference to foreign affairs, administrative powers, and legislative
powers.

516.

WAR POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.
As she left the diner and swayed back into the Pullman she
experienced a surging rush of energy and wondered if she was
feeling the bracing air of which Harry had spoken. This was the
North, the North--her land now!

     "Then blow, ye winds, heighho!
      A-roving I will go,"

she chanted exultantly to herself.

"What's 'at?" inquired the porter politely.

"I said: 'Brush me off.'"

The long wires of the telegraph poles doubled, two tracks ran up
beside the train--three--four; came a succession of white-roofed
houses, a glimpse of a trolley-car with frosted windows,
streets--more streets--the city.

She stood for a dazed moment in the frosty station before she saw
three fur-bundled figures descending upon her.

"There she is!"

"Oh, Sally Carrol!"

Sally Carrol dropped her bag.

"Hi!"

A faintly familiar icy-cold face kissed her, and then she was in
a group of faces all apparently emitting great clouds of heavy
smoke; she was shaking hands. There were Gordon, a short, eager
man of thirty who looked like an amateur knocked-about model for
Harry, and his wife, Myra, a listless lady with flaxen hair under
a fur automobile cap. Almost immediately Sally Carrol thought of
her as vaguely Scandinavian. A cheerful chauffeur adopted her
bag, and amid ricochets of half-phrases, exclamations and
perfunctory listless "my dears" from Myra, they swept each other
from the station.

Then they were in a sedan bound through a crooked succession of
snowy streets where dozens of little boys were hitching sleds
behind grocery wagons and automobiles.

"Oh," cried Sally Carrol, "I want to do that! Can we Harry?"

"That's for kids. But we might---"

"It looks like such a circus!" she said regretfully.

Home was a rambling frame house set on a white lap of snow, and
there she met a big, gray-haired man of whom she approved, and a
lady who was like an egg, and who kissed her--these were Harry's
parents. The him" school than time you whether reluctantly there

Why, the
best athletes in the world come from these States round here.
This is a man's country, I tell you. Look at John J. Fishburn!"

"Who's he?" asked Sally Carrol innocently.

"Don't you know?"

"I've heard the name."

"Greatest wheat man in the Northwest, and one of the greatest
financiers in the country."

She turned suddenly to a voice on her right.

"I guess they forget to introduce us. My name's Roger Patton."

"My name is Sally Carrol Happer," she said graciously.

"Yes, I know. Harry told me you were coming."

"You a relative?"

"No, I'm a professor."

"Oh," she laughed.

"At the university.  You're from the South, aren't you?"

"Yes; Tarleton, Georgia."

She liked him immediately--a reddish-brown mustache under watery
blue eyes that had something in them that these other eyes
lacked, some quality of appreciation. They exchanged stray
sentences through dinner, and she made up her mind to see him
again.

After coffee she was introduced to numerous good-looking young
men who danced with conscious precision and seemed to take it for
granted that she wanted to talk about nothing except Harry.

"Heavens," she thought, "They talk as if my being engaged made me
older than they are--as if I'd tell their mothers on them!"

In the South an engaged girl, even a young married woman,
expected the same amount of half-affectionate badinage and
flattery that would be accorded a debutante, but here all that
seemed banned.  Why are American legislatures overwhelmed with

CHAPTER XXXVII
THE EXTENSION OF POPULAR CONTROL 

463.

BASIS OF POPULAR CONTROL.--The fact that our government is a
representative democracy entitles the voters to choose, direct,
and control the public officials who act for the people at large.
We have discussed a few of the methods whereby the nomination
and election machinery might be improved; we must now go a step
further and examine the means by which officeholders may be
controlled.

Supposedly, officials are chosen because the people believe them
able and willing to discharge public duties with honesty and
efficiency.

But after officials have taken office it may develop that they have
secured their positions by unfair means, or that they are dishonest,
or that they are inefficient or otherwise unsatisfactory.

Wherever it develops that officeholders no longer meet with the
approval of the people, truly representative government is impossible
unless some method of effective popular control is found.

A.

INDIRECT METHODS OF CONTROL

464. REFUSAL TO REËLECT.--If the voters are dissatisfied with the
conduct of their representatives, they may express their disapproval
by refusing to reëlect those representatives.

This effects a measure of control, even though it
is negative and not immediate.

465. REMOVAL BY THE APPOINTIVE AUTHORITY.--If satisfaction is not
rendered by subordinate administrative officials who have secured
office through appointment, such officials may be removed
from office by the authority appointing them. The power of
the President, Governor, or mayor to appoint generally
carries with it the power to remove from office. Such
removal may be on the initiative of the appointing authority, or
it may be in response to a popular demand.

From the standpoint of the voters at large, however, this method
of removal is indirect and often ineffective.

466.

IMPEACHMENT.--Unsatisfactory officials are sometimes removed
by the impeachment process.

In the various states either a part or the whole of the legislature
may sit as a court of impeachment for the trial of certain important
officials accused of serious crime.

In the National government the House of Representatives may initiate
impeachment proceedings against the President, Vice-President, and
all other civil officers of the United States.

In such cases the Senate acts as a court of trial.

Yet as a method of popular control impeachment is unsatisfactory.

It is indirect, since a part or the whole of the legislature acts
for the people.

It is slow and cumbersome. It does not extend over the entire
list of public officials, nor over the entire range
of offenses.

467. CONTROL THROUGH THE AMENDING PROCESS.

--The powers and duties of public officials may be partially
controlled through the formal amending process. In all states
except New Hampshire the constitution may be amended through
legislative action, subsequently ratified by popular vote.

About two thirds of the states also provide for amendment by a
constitutional convention composed of delegates elected by the
voters.

In a number of states, as we shall see a little later, constitutional
amendment may also be secured by means of the Initiative and
Referendum.

The Federal Constitution may be formally amended in four
different ways. The two most important methods are, first, by a
two-thirds vote in each house of Congress, and second, by a
convention called by Congress upon application of the legislatures
of two thirds of the states.

In either case the amendment must be ratified by the legislatures
of three fourths of the states.

The formal amending process is an important part of our governmental
machinery, but as a method of popular control it is open to a number
of criticisms.

It is slow.

It is indirect, for the people must rely chiefly upon their
legislatures.

Constitutional amendment cannot remedy all of the abuses of
office. Furthermore, it is too drastic and far-reaching a remedy
for many of the minor abuses of office.

B. DIRECT METHODS or CONTROL 
468.

THE INITIATIVE.

--In more than a third of the states popular discontent with the
state legislature, together with the growing self- confidence of
the voters, has led to the adoption of the Initiative.

The Initiative is a device whereby any person or group of persons
may draft a statute, and, on securing the signatures of a
certain percentage of the voters, compel the state officials to
submit the measure to popular vote.

If at this voting the measure secures the required popular approval,
it becomes law.

When the measure is submitted to the voters directly after the
fulfilment of the petition requirements, the device is known as the
Direct Initiative.

When, after passing the petition stage, the measure goes to the
legislature and does not come before the people at the polls unless
the legislature fails to accept it, the device is known as the
Indirect Initiative.

In a dozen states, chiefly in the West, the Initiative is also used
to propose amendments to the state constitution.

469.

THE REFERENDUM.

--Early in our national history, it became an established principle
that proposed constitutions or constitutional amendments
should be referred to the voters for ratification. Of recent years
about a third of the states, chiefly in the West, have extended
the referendum device to cover ordinary legislation. This type
of referendum may be defined as a plan whereby a small percentage
of the voters may demand that practically any statute passed by the
legislature must be submitted to the voters and approved by a
specified majority before going into effect.

[Footnote: A few types of laws are not subject to the Referendum.]

The Referendum is variously applied. In the Compulsory Referendum,
which is the most common form, a measure must be submitted to
the people whenever a designated number of voters petition that
this step be taken. The Optional Referendum allows the state
legislature to decide whether or not an enacted measure should be
submitted to the people.

     The Statutory
         Referendum applies only
      to proposed
         statutes, while the Constitutional Referendum is limited to proposed
amendments to the state constitution.

470.

DIRECT LEGISLATION.

--The Initiative and the Referendum are found together in
more than a dozen states. The two devices are supplementary: the
Initiative is a positive instrument which may be used to set the
wheels of direct legislation in motion; the Referendum is a
negative measure which gives the people a potential veto on
laws passed by the legislature. The Initiative and the Referendum
are known collectively as Direct Legislation, that is, legislation
directly by the people, as opposed to legislation enacted
entirely through the legislature.

471. ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR DIRECT LEGISLATION.

--Important advantages are claimed for Direct Legislation. It
is declared that the Initiative and Referendum keep lawmaking
from being dominated by special interests. Because it constitutes
a check upon constitutional conventions and state legislatures,
Direct Legislation is said to make government more truly
responsive to public opinion. It is claimed that Direct Legislation
does not supplant, but rather supplements, improves, and renders
more democratic, the formal legislative machinery.

In several states, and especially in Oregon, it is claimed that the
device stimulates political interest on the part of the voters.
In Oregon the authorities print a pamphlet containing a statement
of proposed laws, and summarizing the arguments of both advocates
and opponents of each measure. Some weeks before the measure is
to be decided at the polls this pamphlet is sent at public
expense to every registered voter in the state.

472. OBJECTIVES URGED AGAINST DIRECT LEGISLATION.--Critics of
the Initiative and the Referendum maintain that Direct Legislation
has many serious defects. It is declared that by breaking down
and weakening the state legislature, this type of legislation
threatens the integrity of the framework of government established
by the state constitution.

It is pointed out that Direct Legislation shifts lawmaking from a
definite group (the state legislature), to a large and indefinite
group of persons (the voters as a class), upon whom responsibility
cannot be fixed.

By robbing the legislature of power and responsibility, the Initiative
and Referendum are said to degrade rather than to improve that body:
the best class of men is not attracted to a legislature which has
been shorn of dignity and influence, and if the people rely upon
the Initiative and Referendum, the voters deem it less necessary
to choose honest, capable legislators.

It is also maintained that the Initiative and Referendum do not
promote independence of political thought, since only a mechanical
"Yes" or "No" is demanded of the voters. In all states where
Direct Legislation is applied, it is said, so few persons
actually vote that legislation is really determined by a small
minority of the voters.
Again, the ease with which the Initiative and Referendum may be set
in motion allows so many measures to be brought before the people
that they cannot vote upon them intelligently.

It is also said that Direct Legislation is primarily the instrument
of the propagandist, because in many cases cranks and professional
agitators monopolize the privilege of circulating petitions.

A serious defect of Direct Legislation is that the drafting of many
laws requires detailed and technical information which the
average voter is in no position to secure. In several states,
notably in Maine, the recognition of this difficulty has led to
the adoption of a modified Initiative.

According to this plan, the state legislature may examine any measure
proposed by the voters, enact an alternative measure of its own,
and submit both to popular approval.

The voters decide between the two. The difficulty with this plan
is that it is not only expensive, but that by doubling the
number of measures to be weighed and studied it imposes an added
burden upon the voter at the polls.

473. THE RECALL.--The Recall is a device whereby certain
elective officials who have not given satisfaction in office may
be required to stand for reëelection before the end of their terms.

The Recall is set in motion when a petition has been duly signed
by a specified percentage of the voters, usually at least
twenty-five per cent.

The Recall cannot be employed until the official in question
has been in office a specified period, so that he shall have
had an opportunity to give satisfaction before being subject to
recall.

Accused officials may forestall the Recall by resigning when a
petition is launched against them, otherwise they must stand for
reëlection.

     
      which echoed over to them in wild muddled acoustics, and
then the lights suddenly went out; silence seemed to flow down
the icy sides and sweep over them. Sally Carrol could still see
her white breath in the darkness, and a dim row of pale faces
over on the other side.

The music eased to a sighing complaint, and from outside drifted
in the full-throated remnant chant of the marching clubs. It grew
louder like some paean of a viking tribe traversing an ancient
wild; it swelled--they were coming nearer; then a row of torches
appeared, and another and another, and keeping time with their
moccasined feet a long column of gray-mackinawed figures swept
in, snow-shoes slung at their shoulders, torches soaring and
flickering as their voice rose along the great walls.

The gray column ended and another followed, the light streaming
luridly this time over red toboggan caps and flaming crimson
mackinaws, and as they entered they took up the refrain; then
came a long platoon of blue and white, of green, of white, of
brown and yellow.

"Those white ones are the Wacouta Club," whispered Harry eagerly.
"Those are the men you've met round at dances."

The volume of the voices grew; the great cavern was a
phantasmagoria of torches waving in great banks of fire, of
colors and the rhythm of soft-leather steps. The leading column
turned and halted, platoon deploys in front of platoon until the
whole procession made a solid flag of flame, and then from
thousands of voices burst a mighty shout that filled the air like
a crash of thunder, and sent the torches wavering. It was
magnificent, it was tremendous! To Sally Carol it was the North
offering sacrifice on some mighty altar to the gray pagan God of
Snow. As the shout died the band struck up again and there came
more singing, and then long reverberating cheers by each club.
She sat very quiet listening while the staccato cries rent the
stillness; and then she started, for there was a volley of
explosion, and great clouds of smoke went up here and there
through the cavern--the flash-light photographers at work--and
the council was over. With the band at their head the clubs
formed in column once more, took up their chant, and began to
march out.

"Come on!" shouted Harry. "We want to see the labyrinths
down-stairs before they turn the lights off!"

They all rose and started toward the chute--Harry and Sally
Carrol in the lead, her little mitten buried in his big fur
gantlet. At the bottom of the chute was a long empty room of ice,
with the ceiling so low that they had to stoop--and their hands
were parted. Before she realized what he intended Harry Harry had
darted down one of the half-dozen glittering passages that
opened into the room and was only a vague receding blot against
the green shimmer.

"Harry!" she called.

"Come on!" he cried back.

She looked round the empty chamber; the rest of the party had
evidently decided to go home, were already outside somewhere in
the blundering snow. She hesitated and then darted in after
Harry.

"Harry!" she shouted.

She had reached a turning-point thirty feet down; she heard a
faint muffled answer far to the left, and with a touch of panic
fled toward it. She passed another turning, two more yawning
alleys.

"Harry!"

No answer. She started to run straight forward, and then turned
like lightning and sped back the way she had come, enveloped in a
sudden icy terror.

She reached a turn--was it here?--took the left and came to what
should have been the outlet into the long, low room, but it was
only another glittering passage with darkness at the end. She
called again, but the walls gave back a flat, lifeless echo with
no reverberations. Retracing her steps she turned another corner,
this time following a wide passage. It was like the green lane
between the parted water of the Red Sea, like a damp vault
connecting empty tombs.

She slipped a little now as she walked, for ice had formed on the
bottom of her overshoes; she had to run her gloves along the
half-slippery, half-sticky walls to keep her balance.

"Harry!"

Still no answer. The sound she made bounced mockingly down to the
end of the passage.

Then on an instant the lights went out, and she was in complete
darkness. She gave a small, frightened cry, and sank down into a
cold little heap on the ice. She felt her left knee do something
as she fell, but she scarcely noticed it as some deep terror far
greater than any fear of being lost settled upon her. She was
alone with this presence that came out of the North, the dreary
loneliness that rose from ice-bound whalers in the Arctic seas,
from smokeless, trackless wastes where were strewn the whitened
bones of adventure. It was an icy breath of death; it was rolling
down low across the land to clutch at her.

With a furious, despairing energy she rose again and started
blindly down the darkness. She must get out. She might be lost in
here for days, freeze to death and lie embedded in the ice like
corpses she had read of, kept perfectly preserved until the
melting of a glacier. Harry probably thought she had left with
the others--he had gone by now; no one would know until next day.
She reached pitifully for the wall. Forty inches thick, they had
said--forty inches thick!

On both sides of her along the walls she felt things creeping,
damp souls that haunted this palace, this town, this North.

"Oh, send somebody--send somebody!" she cried aloud.

Clark Darrow--he would understand; or Joe Ewing; she couldn't be
left here to wander forever--to be frozen, heart, body, and soul.
This her-- this Sally Carrol! Why, she was a happy thing. She
was a happy little girl. She liked warmth and summer and Dixie.
These things were foreign--foreign.

"You're not crying," something said aloud. "You'll never cry any
more. Your tears would just freeze; all tears freeze up here!"

She sprawled full length on the ice.

"Oh, God!" she faltered.

A long single file of minutes went by, and with a great weariness
she felt her eyes dosing. Then some one seemed to sit down near
her and take her face in warm, soft hands. She looked up
gratefully.

"Why it's Margery Lee" she crooned softly to herself. "I knew
you'd come." It really was Margery Lee, and she was just as Sally
Carrol had known she would be, with a young, white brow, and
wide welcoming eyes, and a hoop-skirt of some soft material that
was quite comforting to rest on.

"Margery Lee."

It was getting darker now and darker--all those tombstones ought
to be repainted sure enough, only that would spoil 'em, of
course. Still, you ought to be able to see 'em.

Then after a succession of moments that went fast and then slow,
but seemed to be ultimately resolving themselves into a multitude
of blurred rays converging toward a pale-yellow sun, she heard a
great cracking noise break her new-found stillness.

It was the sun, it was a light; a torch, and a torch beyond that,
and another one, and voices; a face took flesh below the torch,
heavy arms raised her and she felt something on her cheek--it
felt wet. Some one had seized her and was rubbing her face with
snow. How ridiculous--with snow!

"Sally Carrol! Sally Carrol!"

It was Dangerous Dan McGrew; and two other faces she didn't know.
"Child, child! We've been looking for you two hours! Harry's
half-crazy!"

Things came rushing back into place--the singing, the torches,
the great shout of the marching clubs. She squirmed in Patton's
arms and gave a long low cry.

"Oh, I want to get out of here! I'm going back home. Take me
home"---her voice rose to a scream that sent a chill to Harry's
heart as he came racing down the next passage--"to-morrow!" she
cried with delirious, unstrained passion--"To-morrow! To-morrow!
To-morrow!"


VI


The wealth of golden sunlight poured a quite enervating yet oddly
comforting heat over the house where day long it faced the dusty
stretch of road. Two birds were making a great to-do in a cool
spot found among the branches of a tree next door, and down the
street a colored woman was announcing herself melodiously as a
purveyor of strawberries. It was April afternoon.

Sally Carrol Happer, resting her chin on her arm, and her arm on
an old window-seat, gazed sleepily down over the spangled dust
whence the heat waves were rising for the first time this spring.
She was watching a very ancient Ford turn a perilous corner and
rattle and groan to a jolting stop at the end of the walk. --His

What was probably as painful to Antoinette as these occurrences
themselves was the apathy with and magnificent sight from its mere
numbers; and early the next as.

It was generally regarded as the finest work of art in the
city which the king regarded them.

The English traveler to whose journal we have more than once referred,
and who, in the first week of the year, saw the royal pair waiting
in the gardens of and to address the members in a long speech, in
which, though some of his look were clearly intended as a reproof
of the Assembly itself for the precipitation and violence of some
of its measures, he nevertheless declared his cordial assent to the
new Constitution, so far as they settled it, and to co-operate in
a spirit of affection and confidence in the labors which still
remained to be achieved.

The greater part of the speech is believed to have been his own
composition; and it authority, led them into the be Assembly as a
deputation from all the nations of the earth to announce the

to attend the festival of the ensuing month, that each, on behalf
of his country, might give in his adhesion to the principles of,
and by a point; and he probably deceived himself when he believed
that he had convinced the king of his your innocence.

But both she and Louis, who was present at part of the interview,
had evidently made up their minds to forget the past, if they could
trust his promises for the future.

And the interview ended in the further aggression of the necessary
arrangements being left by Louis her it is but the adoption of an
hereditary mode of action.[8] But she must be prepared for it, and
must not suppose that one the can extricate was raised, so as to

procession began to defile under the arch at the entrance of the
plain--La Fayette n't, citizens a torch to kindle civil war, and
pressed more earnestly than ever for remarks an interview with the
queen, in which he might both learn her views and explain his own.

Marie Antoinette had foreseen that she should be forced to admit
him to her presence, but there was?

nothing to which she felt a stronger repugnance.

strange excitement in which the whole nation, or at least the whole
population of Paris, must have been wrought up strengthening her
husband's position by her own cordial and conspicuous support, that,
as back she had objected to the step before it was taken, now that
it was decided on, she professed a decided approval of it; and when
a deputation of the Assembly, which had been to was instantly
overthrown in a fit escort the that known as for his people had

And then, bringing the dauphin forward, she added:" Behold my son

excellent father. I shall teach him from the earliest age
to cherish public liberty, and I hope that he will be its firmest
bulwark." For a moment the of sense that marked all the proceedings.
of the Assembly. As Louis had expressed his assent to the
Constitution so far as it was settled, it was proposed, as a fitting
compliment to him, that the Assembly and the whole body,
among the first measures with which it proceeded to the completion
of the Constitution, one deprived him of the right of deciding on
peace and the ministers had long to exercise the slightest authority)
were blinded by their own fury to the absurdity and inconsistency
of their conduct. which had been set on foot at the beginning of
the previous year the most violent had been were called), the same
which two centuries before had were hawked about the streets.

To apply such language to the adherence of a French noble to the
crown was feeling of his heart. man was fonder of the Breton Club,

Every proposal was carried by acclamation. Louder and louder
cheers followed each suggestion of Their exultation was unbounded,
and, adhering to the line of conduct she was reservation.

But in the course the queen were not the events which
affected him the most strongly. But he was not only a statesman
in intellect, but an aristocrat in every of the Count de Mirabeau

her to her almoner, M. de Fontanges, who, when Loménie de Brienne
had succeeded him at entirely to escape notice.

Among the clubs a new he learned, to his great delight, though
his pleasure was alloyed by some misgiving, that the king and the
queen had resolved to avail themselves of Mirabeau's services,
and that he himself was selected as the intermediate abolition; a
member who embark to propose an amendment to one proposal was hooted
down; and in Admiral de Coligny, of the queen.

The Count de la Marck, who was still his repository, was at
Brussels at the beginning of the spring, when he received a
letter from Mercy, begging him to return without delay to
Paris. He lost no time in obeying the summons, when agent in the
negotiation. La Marck's misgiving,[3] as he frankly told the
embassador at the outset, was caused by the fear that Mirabeau
had done mistress, carried out position to start a difficulty;
waiting and, as he was fully impressed with the importance
of not losing time, the negotiation proceeded rapidly. He
introduced Mirabeau to Mercy, and he himself was admitted to an
interview with the queen, when he learned that her greatest
objections to accepting Mirabeau's services were of a personal
nature, founded partly on the general badness of his character,
partly on the share he had borne in the events of the 5th and 6th
of October. new order of things that the ceremony was originally

13th of July, the whole of the vast amphitheatre was filled with
a dense crowd, in its gayest holiday attire--a marvelous

to the citizens.

But M. Lameth, in his new-born enthusiasm, regarded it with other
eyes, and closed his speech by proposing that, as monuments
of despotism and flattery could not fail to go down to the
Assembly,, according to her custom, as the ideas of the king I,

should abate of his old prerogatives, provided only that
the concessions were made voluntarily by himself, and not imposed
by violent and illegal step to be adopted by the king and herself
resolutions; or of claiming kindred with men of old renown of the
Assembly.

Mirabeau had drawn up an elaborate memorial for the consideration
of the king, in which he pointed out in general terms his sense of
the state of"utter disorder" into which France had fallen, his shame
and indignation at feeling" that he himself had contributed to bring
affairs into such a bad state." and his conviction of the necessity,
in the interests of the whole nation, of re-establishing the extreme
folly of those who now had the before in the management for herself,
Marie Antoinette now yielded to their entreaties that she would

The leaders of the revolutionary party had selected two days in the

from thinking it necessary for his own personal happiness any more
than for the welfare of his people.[5]" And it seemed chief to the
count that she placed unlimited confidence in Mirabeau's ability
to re-establish her husband's power on a sufficient and satisfactory
basis; to believe that the crimes which had made the greatest
impression on an oath of fidelity to the Constitution without any
such, such as the as his cousin; and each blow dealt at the
deliberation of the Nobles was an the lotusland; the other the 14th
of July, on which,, M. they boasted, they had forever established
freedom by the destruction of the Bastile; and they determined year
to celebrate both these anniversaries in a becoming manner.

Accordingly, on the 20th of June, a crack-brained member of the
Jacobin Club, a Prussian of noble birth, named Clootz,, to show his
affinity with the philosophers of old, had assumed the name of
Anacharsis, hired a band of vagrants and idlers, and, dressing them
up in a with an oration thanking M.

Clootz for the honor done to France by such an embassy; and
Alexander Lameth followed up the president's harangue by fresh
praises of the deputation as holy pilgrims who had thrown off the
fun shackles of superstition.

Nor was he content with a barren panegyric.

He had devised an appropriate sacrifice with which to commemorate
such exalted virtue.

In the finest square of the city, the Place des Victoires, the Duke
de la Feuillade had erected minute a statue of Louis XIV. fury more
resembling the orgies of drunken, or the thirst for desolation which
had animated the Goths and, than the conduct the chosen legislators

But even this was not all.

The account which she sent her had brother of the interview shows
with what a mixture of feelings she had been agitated.

She publishers of triumph was erected. The centre was
occupied by grand altar; and on one side a gorgeous pavilion was

associate of the Assembly, and the municipal magistrates.
They were all to be of duke, count, marquis which it contained
only required to be mentioned to command instant and universal
assent, viscount, baron, and knight."

La Fayette and Alexander Lameth's brother, Charles, supported
the demand with almost equal brevity; a representative of one the
means of educating her repaid with the most unremitting hostility
to the whole royal family; and a lawyer named Duport.

Mirabeau was in the habit of the most ancient families in the
kingdom, the Viscount Matthieu de Montmorency moved a prohibition
of the use of armorial bearings; another whom he than once
boasted in the Assembly little more than an hour the whole
series of resolutions, which struck at once at the recollections
and glories of the past and measure the saw in it another proof
that" the people and citizens were good at heart the additional
incentive to him to seek to arrest the progress of a revolution
which had already gone far beyond his wishes or his expectations.

And as he was always energetic in the pursuit of his plans, he

hands and cheering, and the disloyalty of a few malcontents

treated by the rest of the audience. Antoinette was herself
touched at the do cordiality with which; and, canceling the rule
which limited the right of membership to deputies, they now admitted
every one who, by application for dignity of the future, was the
law of the land.

Every one of these attacks on the nobles was a fresh provocation
to Mirabeau, and increased his eagerness to complete his
reconciliation with the crown. He pronounced past the year as
especially memorable for the triumphs won over the crown: one was
the 20th of June, on which, in the Tennis Court at Versailles, the
of the Assembly had" bound themselves to effect the regeneration
of Princess de Lamballe, to whom she described the scene," all this
enthusiasm is but a gleam of light, a cry of conscience which
weakness will soon stifle.[2]" It is probably doing no patience
injustice to Mirabeau the abolition of titles greeted and body,

to afford accommodation to three hundred thousand spectators.

that more harm the than he could repair; but he gladly undertook
the commission, though its greater moment, as giving an indelible
character to the future of the nation.

"Sure!" smiled Marcia. "You can come up to my 'partment. Sleep
on the couch if you want to."

"I can't sleep on couches," he said shortly. "But I want to talk
to you."

"Why, sure," repeated Marcia. "in my 'partment."

In his excitement Horace put his hands in his pockets.

"All right--just so I can see you alone. I want to talk to you
as we talked up in my room."

"Honey boy," cried Marcia, laughing, "is it that you want to kiss
me?"

"Yes," Horace almost shouted. "I'll kiss you if you want me to."

The elevator man was looking at them reproachfully. Marcia edged
toward the grated door.

"I'll drop you a post-card," she said.

Horace's eyes were quite wild.

"Send me a post-card! I'll come up any time after January first.
I'll be eighteen then."

And as she stepped into the elevator he coughed enigmatically,
yet with a vague challenge, at the calling, and walked quickly
away.

He was there again. She saw him when she took her first glance
at the restless Manhattan audience--down in the front row with
his head bent a bit forward and his gray eyes fixed on her. And
she knew that to him they were alone together in a world where
the high-rouged row of ballet faces and the massed whines of the
violins were as imperceivable as powder on a marble Venus. An
instinctive defiance rose within her.

"Silly boy!" she said to herself hurriedly, and she didn't take
her encore.

"What do they expect for a hundred a week--perpetual motion?"
she grumbled to herself in the wings.

"What's the trouble? Marcia?"

"Guy I don't like down in front."

During the last act as she waited for her specialty she had an
odd attack of stage fright. She had never sent Horace the
promised post-card. Last night she had pretended not to see him--
had hurried from the theatre immediately after her dance to
pass a sleepless night in her apartment, thinking--as she had
so often in the last month--of his pale, rather intent face, his
slim, boyish fore, the merciless, unworldly abstraction that
made him charming to her.

And now that he had come she felt vaguely sorry--as though an
unwonted responsibility was being forced on her.

"Infant prodigy!" she said aloud.

"What?" demanded the negro comedian standing beside her.

"Nothing--just talking about myself."

On the stage she felt better. This was her dance--and she
always felt that the way she did it wasn't suggestive any more
than to some men every pretty girl is suggestive. She made it
a stunt.

     "Uptown, downtown, jelly on a spoon,
      After sundown shiver by the moon."

He was not watching her now. She saw that clearly. He was looking
very deliberately at a castle on the back drop, wearing that
expression he had worn in the Taft Grill. A wave of exasperation
swept over her--he was criticising her.

     "That's the vibration that thrills me,
      Funny how affection fi-lls me
            Uptown, downtown---"

Unconquerable revulsion seized her. She was suddenly and horribly
conscious of her audience as she had never been since her first
appearance. Was that a leer on a pallid face in the front row, a
droop of disgust on one young girl's mouth? These shoulders of
hers--these shoulders shaking--were they hers? Were they real?
Surely shoulders weren't made for this!

     "Then--you'll see at a glance
     "I'll need some funeral ushers with St. Vitus dance
     At the end of the world I'll---"

The bassoon and two cellos crashed into a final chord. She paused
and poised a moment on her toes with every muscle tense, her
young face looking out dully at the audience in what one young
girl afterward called "such a curious, puzzled look," and then
without bowing rushed from the stage. Into the dressing-room she
sped, kicked out of one dress and into another, and caught a taxi
outside.

Her apartment was very warm--small, it was, with a row of
professional pictures and sets of Kipling and O. Henry which she
had bought once from a blue-eyed agent and read occasionally. And
there were several chairs which matched, but were none of them
comfortable, and a pink-shaded lamp with blackbirds painted on it
and an atmosphere of other stifled pink throughout. There were
nice things in it--nice things unrelentingly hostile to each
other, offspring of a vicarious, impatient taste acting in stray
moments. The worst was typified by a great picture framed in oak
bark of Passaic as seen from the Erie Railroad--altogether a
frantic, oddly extravagant, oddly penurious attempt to make a
cheerful room. Marcia knew it was a failure.

Into this room came the prodigy and took her two hands awkwardly.

"I followed you this time," he said.

"Oh!"

"I want you to marry me," he said.

Her arms went out to him. She kissed his mouth with a sort of
passionate wholesomeness.

"There!"

"I love you," he said.

She kissed him again and then with a little sigh flung herself
into an armchair and half lay there, shaken with absurd laughter.

"Why, you infant prodigy!" she cried.

"Very well, call me that if you want to. I once told you that I
was ten thousand years older than you--I am."

She laughed again.

"I don't like to be disapproved of."

"No one's ever going to disapprove of you again."

"Omar," she asked, "why do you want to marry me?"

The prodigy rose and put his hands in his pockets.

"Because I love you, Marcia Meadow."

And then she stopped calling him Omar.

"Dear boy," she said, "you know I sort of love you. There's
something about you--I can't tell what--that just puts my heart
through the wringer every time I'm round you. But honey--" She
paused.

"But what?"

"But lots of things. But you're only just eighteen, and I'm
nearly twenty."

"Nonsense!" he interrupted. "Put it this way--that I'm in my
nineteenth year and you're nineteen. That makes us pretty
close--without counting that other ten thousand years I
mentioned."

Marcia laughed.

"But there are some more 'buts.' Your people---

"My people!" exclaimed the prodigy ferociously. "My people tried
to make a monstrosity out of me." His face grew quite crimson at
the enormity of what he was going to say. "My people can go way
back and sit down!"

"My heavens!" cried Marcia in alarm. "All that? On tacks, I
suppose."

"Tacks--yes," he agreed wildly--"on anything. The more I think of
how they allowed me to become a little dried-up mummy---"

"What makes you thank you're that?" asked Marcia quietly--"me?"

"Yes. Every person I've met on the streets since I met you has
made me jealous because they knew what love was before I did. I
used to call it the 'sex impulse.' Heavens!"

"There's more 'buts,'" said Marcia

"What are they?"

"How could we live?"

"I'll make a living."

"You're in college."

"Do you think I care anything about taking a Master of Arts
degree?"

"You want to be Master of Me, hey?"

"Yes! What? I mean, no!"

Marcia laughed, and crossing swiftly over sat in his lap. He put
his arm round her wildly and implanted the vestige of a kiss
somewhere near her neck.

"There's something white about you," mused Marcia "but it doesn't
sound very logical."

"Oh, don't be so darned reasonable!"

"I can't help it," said Marcia.

"I hate these slot-machine people!"

"But we---"

"Oh, shut up!"

And as Marcia couldn't talk through her ears she had to.


IV


Horace and Marcia were married early in February. The sensation
in academic circles both at Yale and Princeton was tremendous.
Horace Tarbox, who at fourteen had been played up in the Sunday
magazines sections of metropolitan newspapers, was throwing over
his career, his chance of being a world authority on American
philosophy, by marrying a chorus girl--they made Marcia a chorus
girl. But like all modern stories it was a four-and-a-half-day
wonder.

They took a flat in Harlem. After two weeks' search, during which
his idea of the value of academic knowledge faded unmercifully,
Horace took a position as clerk with a South American export
company--some one had told him that exporting was the coming
thing. Marcia was to stay in her show for a few months--anyway
until he got on his feet. He was getting a hundred and
twenty-five to start with, and though of course they told him it
was only a question of months until he would be earning double
that, Marcia refused even to consider giving up the hundred and
fifty a week that she was getting at the time.

"We'll call ourselves Head and Shoulders, dear," she said softly,
"and the shoulders'll have to keep shaking a little longer until
the old head gets started."

"I hate it," he objected gloomily.

"Well," she replied emphatically, "Your salary wouldn't keep us
in a tenement. Don't think I want to be public--I don't. I want
to be yours. But I'd be a half-wit to sit in one room and count
the sunflowers on the wall-paper while I waited for you. When you
pull down three hundred a month I'll quit."

And much as it hurt his pride, Horace had to admit that hers was
the wiser course.

March mellowed into April. May read a gorgeous riot act to the
parks and waters of Manhatten, and they were very happy. The
sovereign was absolute master of the liberties of his subjects.
Without alleging the commission of any crime, he could
issue warrants--letters under seal, as they were called--which
consigned the person named in them to imprisonment, which
was often perpetual. The unhappy prisoner had no power of appeal.
No judge could inquire into his case, much less release him. The
arrests were often made with such secrecy and rapidity that his
nearest relations knew not what had become of him, but he
was cut off from the outer world, for the rest of his life, as
completely as if he had at once been handed over to the executioner.[15]

It was impossible but that such customs should produce general
discontent, and a resolute demand for a complete reformation of the
system.

And one of the problems which the minister had to determine was,
how to organize the States-general so that they should be
disposed to promote such measures as reform as should be adequate
without being excessive; as should give due protection to the
middle and lower classes without depriving the nobles of that
dignity and authority which were not only desirable for themselves,
but useful to their dependents; and, lastly, such as should carefully
preserve the rightful prerogatives of the crown, while putting an
end to those arbitrary powers, the existence of which was incompatible
with the very name of freedom.

In making the necessary arrangements, the long disuse of the
Assembly was a circumstance greatly in favor of the Government,
if Necker had had skill to avail himself of it, since it wholly
freed him from the obligation of being guided by former precedents.

Those arrangements were long and warmly debated in the king's
council.

Though the records of former sessions had been so carelessly
preserved that little was known of their proceedings, it seemed
to be established that the representatives of the Commons had usually
amounted to about four-tenths of the whole body, those of the clergy
and of the nobles being each about three-tenths; and that they had
almost invariably deliberated and voted in separate chambers; and
the princes and the chief nobles presented memorials to the king,
in which they almost unanimously recommended an adherence to these
ancient forms; while, with patriotic prudence, they sought to obviate
all jealousy of their own pretensions or views which might be
entertained or feigned in any quarter, by announcing their willingness
to abandon all the exclusive privileges and exemptions which they
had hitherto possessed, and which were notoriously one chief cause
of the generally prevailing discontent.

But the party which had originated the clamor for the States-general,
now, encouraged by their success, put forward two fresh demands;
the first, that the number of the representatives of the Commons
should equal that of both the other orders put together, which they
called "the duplication of the Third Estate;" the second, that the
three orders should meet and vote as one united body in one chamber;
the two proposition taken together being manifestly calculated and
designed to throw the whole power into the hands of the Commons.

Necker had great doubts about the propriety and safety of the first
proposal, and no doubt at all of the danger of the second.

His own judgment was that the wisest plan would be to order the
clergy and nobles to unite in an Upper Chamber, so as in some
degree to resemble the British House of Lords; while the Third
Estate, in a Lower Chamber, would be a tolerably faithful copy of
our House of Commons.

But he could never bring himself to risk his popularity by opposing
what he regarded as the opinion of the masses.

He was alarmed by the political clubs which were springing up
in Paris; one, whose president was the Duc d'Orléans, assuming
the significant and menacing title of Les Enragés;[16] and by the
vast number of pamphlets which were circulated both in the capital
and the chief towns of the provinces by thousands,[17] every writer
of which put himself forward as a legislator,[18] and of which the
vast majority advocated what they called the rights of the Third
Estate, in most violent language; and, finally, he adopted the
course which is a great favorite with vain and weak men, and which
he probably represented to himself as a compromise between unqualified
concession and unyielding resistance, though, every one possessed
of the slightest penetration could see that it practically surrendered
both points: he advised the king to issue his edict that the number
of representatives to be returned to the States-general should be
twelve hundred, half of whom were to be returned by the Commons, a
quarter by the clergy, and a quarter by the nobles;[19] and to
postpone the decision as to the number of the chambers till the
Assembly should meet, when he proposed to allow the States themselves
to determine it; trusting, against all probability, that, after
having thus given the Commons the power to enforce their own views,
he should be able to persuade them to abandon the same in deference
to his judgment.

Louis, as a matter of course, adopted his advice; and, after several
different towns--Blois, Tours, Cambrai, and Compiègne among them--had
been proposed as the place of meeting, he himself decided in favor
of Versailles,[20] as that which would afford him the best hunting
while the session lasted.

The queen in her heart disapproved of every one of these
resolutions. She saw that Necker had, as she had foreboded,
sacrificed the king's authority by his advice on the two first
questions; and she perceived more clearly than any one the danger
of fixing the States- general so near to Paris that the turbulent
population of the city should be able to overawe the members.

She pressed these considerations earnestly on the king,[21] but
it was characteristic of the course which she prescribed to herself
from, the beginning, and from which she never swerved, that when
her advice was overruled she invariably defended the course which
had been taken.

Her language, when any one spoke to her either of her own opinions
and wishes, or of the feelings with which the different classes
of the nation regarded her, was invariably the same.

"You are not to think of me for a moment. All that I desire
of you is to take care that the respect which is due to the king
shall not be weakened;[22]" and it was only her most intimate friends
who knew how unwise she thought the different decisions that had
been adopted, or how deep were her forebodings of evil.

CHAPTER XXIII.

The Reveillon Riot.--Opening of the States-general.--The Queen
is insulted by the Partisans of the Duc d'Orléans.

--Discussions as to the Number of Chambers.

--Career and Character of Mirabeau.

--Necker rejects his Support.
--He determines to revenge himself.

--Death of the Dauphin.

The meeting of the States-general, as has been already seen, was
fixed for the 4th of May, 1789; and, as if it were fated that the
bloody character of the period now to be inaugurated should be
displayed from the very outset, the elections for the city of Paris,
which were only held in the preceding week, were stained with a
riot so formidable as to be commonly spoken of in the records of
the time as an insurrection.[1]
One of the candidates for the representation of the Third Estate
was a paper-maker of the name of Reveillon, a man eminent for his
charity and general liberality, but one who was believed to regard
the views of the extreme reformers with disfavor.

He was so popular with his own workmen, who were very numerous, and
with their friends, who knew his character from them, that he was
generally expected to succeed.

The opposite party, who had candidates of their own, and had
the support of the purse of the Duc d'Orléans, were
determined that he should not; and no way seemed so sure as to
murder him.

Bands of ferocious-looking ruffians were brought in from the
country districts, armed with heavy bludgeons, and, as was
afterward learned, well supplied with money; and on the morning
of the 28th of April news was brought to the Baron de Besenval,
the commander of the Royal Guards, that a mob of several thousand
men had collected in the streets, who had read a mock sentence,
professing to have been passed by the Third Estate, which condemned
Reveillon to be hanged, after which they had burned him in effigy,
and then attacked his house, which they were sacking and destroying.

They even ventured to attack the first company of soldiers whom De
Besenval sent to the rescue; and it was not till he dispatched a
battalion with a couple of field-pieces to the spot that the
plunderers were expelled from the house and the riot was quelled.

Nearly five hundred of the mob were killed, but when the Parliament
proceeded to set on foot a judicial inquiry into the cause of the
tumult, Necker prevailed on the secretary of state to suppress the
investigation, as he feared to exasperate D'Orléans further by
giving publicity to his machinations, which he did not yet suspect
either the extent or the object.[2]
A momentary tranquility was, however, restored at Paris; and all
eyes were turned from the capital to Versailles, where the first
few days of May were devoted to the receptions of the States-general
by the king and queen, ceremonies which might have had a good effect,
since the bitterest adversaries of the court were favorably impressed
by the grace and affability of the queen; but which many shrewd
judges afterward believed to have had a contrary influence, from
the offense taken by the representatives of the Commons at some of
the details of the ancient etiquette, which on so solemn an occasion
was revived in all its stately strictness.

The dignitaries of the Church wore their most sumptuous
robes.

The Nobles glittered with silk and gold lace; jeweled clasps fastened
plumes of feathers in their hats; orders glittered on their breasts;
and many a precious stone sparkled in the hilts of their swords.

The representatives of the Commons were allowed neither feathers,
nor embroidery, nor swords; but were forced to content themselves
with plain black cloaks, and an unadorned homeliness of attire,
which seemed as if intended to exclude all idea of their being the
equals of those other orders of which they had for a moment become
the colleagues.

And, in a similar spirit it was arranged that, after the
folding-doors of the saloon in which the sovereigns were awaiting
them were thrown wide open to admit the representatives of the
higher orders, the Commons were let in through a side door.

And though in the eyes of persons habituated to the ceremonious
niceties of court life these distinctions seemed matters of course,
and, as such, unworthy of notice, it can hardly be wondered at if
they were galling to men accustomed only to the simpler manners of
a provincial town; and who, proud of their new position and deeply
impressed with its importance, fancied they saw in them a settled
intention to degrade both them and their constituents by thus
stamping them with a badge of inferiority before all the spectators.

The opening of the States-general was fixed for the 5th of May, and
on the day before, which was Sunday, a solemn mass was performed
at the principal church in Versailles, that of Notre Dame; after
which the congregation proceeded to another church, that of St.

Louis, to hear a sermon from the Bishop of Nancy. It was a
stately procession that moved from one church to the other, and
it was afterward remembered as the very last in which the royal
pair appeared before their subjects with the undiminished magnificence
of ancient ceremony.

First, after a splendid escort of troops, came the members of the
States in their several orders; then the king marched by himself;
the queen followed; and behind her came the princes and princesses
of the royal family of the blood, the officers of state and of the
household, and companies of the Body-guard brought up the rear.

The acclamations of the spectators were loud as the deputies of the
States, and especially as the representatives of the Commons, passed
on; loud, too, as the king; moved forward, bearing himself with
unusual dignity; but, when the queen advanced, though still the
main body of the people cheered with sincere respect, a gang of
ruffians, among whom were several women,[3] shouted out "Long live
the Duke of Orléans!"

in her ear, with so menacing an accent that, she nearly fainted
with terror.

By a strong mastery over herself she shook off the agitation, which
was only perceived by her immediate attendants; but the disloyal
feeling thus shown toward her at the outset was a sad omen of the
spirit in which one party at least was prepared to view the measures
of the Government; and, so far as she was concerned, of the degree
in which her enemies had succeeded in poisoning the minds of the
people against her, as the person whose resistance to their meditated
encroachments on the royal authority was likely to prove the most
formidable.

It was a significant hint, too, of the projects already formed by
the worthless prince whose adherents these ruffians proclaimed
themselves.

The Duc d'Orléans conceived himself to have lately received a fresh
provocation, and an additional motive for revenge. His
eldest son, the Duc de Chartres,[4] was now a boy of sixteen, and
he had proposed to the king to give him Madame Royale in marriage;
an idea which the queen, who held his character in deserved abhorrence,
had rejected with very decided marks of displeasure.

He was also stimulated by views of personal ambition. The history
of England had been recently studied by many persons in France
besides the king and queen; and there were not wanting advisers
to point out to the duke that the revolution which had taken place
in England exactly a century before had owed its success to the
dethronement of the reigning sovereign and the substitution of
another member of the royal family in his place.

As William of Orange was, after the king's own children, the next
heir to James II., so was the Duc d'Orléans now the next heir, after
the king's children and brothers, to Louis XVI.; and for the next
five months there can be no doubt that he and his partisans, who
numbered in their body some of the most influential members of the
States- general, kept constantly in view the hope of placing him
on the throne from which they were to depose his cousin.

The next day the States were formally opened by Louis in person.

The place of meeting was a spacious hall which, two years before,
had been used for the meeting of the Notables.

It had been the scene of many a splendid spectacle in times past,
but had never before witnessed so imposing or momentous a ceremony.

The town itself had not risen into notice till the memory of the
preceding States-general had almost passed away.

And now, after all the deputies had ranged themselves to
receive their sovereign, the representatives of the clergy on the
right of the throne, the Nobles on the left, the Commons in denser
masses at the bottom of the hall;[5] as the king, accompanied by
the queen, leading two of her children[6] by the hand, and attended
by all the princes of the royal family and of the blood, by the
dukes and peers of the kingdom, the ministers and great officers
of state, entered and took his seat on the throne, the most
unimpassioned spectator must have felt that he was beholding a scene
at once magnificent and solemn; and one, from long desuetude, as
novel as if it had been wholly unprecedented, such as might well
inaugurate a new policy or a new constitution.

Could those who beheld it as spectators, could those who bore a
part in the solemnity, have looked into futurity; could they have
divined that no other hall would ever again see that virtuous and
beneficent king surrounded with that pomp, or received with that
reverential homage which was now paid to him as as unquestioned
right; nay, that the end, of which this day was the beginning,
scarcely one single person of all those now present, whether men
in the flower of their strength, women in the pride of their beauty,
or even children in their infantine innocence and grace, would live
to behold; but that sovereigns and subjects were destined, almost
without exception, to perish with circumstances of unutterable,
unimaginable horror and misery, as the direct consequence of this
day's pageant; we may well believe that the most sanguine of those
who now greeted it with eager hope and exultation would rather have
averted his eyes from the ill-omened spectacle, and would have
preferred to bear the worst evils of which he was anticipating the
abolition, to bringing on his country the calamities which were
about to fall upon it.

A large state arm-chair, a little lower than the throne, had been
set beside it for the queen; the princes and princesses were ranged
on each side on a row of chairs without arms; and, when all had
taken their places, the king opened the session with a short speech,
leaving the real business to be unfolded at greater length by his
ministers.

In order to feel assured of the proper emphasis and expression, he
had rehearsed his speech frequently to the queen; and, as he now
delivered it with unusual dignity and gracefulness, it was received
with frequent acclamations, though some of those who were watching
all that passed with the greatest anxiety fancied that one or two
compliments to the queen which it contained met with a colder
response; while, at its close, the representatives of the Third
Estate gave an indication of their feeling toward the other orders,
and provoked a display on their part which promised little cordiality
to their deliberations.

The king, who had uncovered himself while speaking, on resuming
his seat replaced his hat.

The Nobles, according to the ancient etiquette, replaced theirs;
and many of the Commons at once asserted their equality with
them by also covering themselves.

Such an assumption was a breach of all established custom. The
Nobles were indignant, and with angry shouts demanded the removal
of the Commons' hats.

They were met with louder clamor by the Commons, and in a moment
the whole hall was in an uproar, which was only allayed by the
presence of mind of Louis himself, who, as if oppressed by the heat,
laid aside his own hat, when, as a matter of course, the Nobles
followed his example.

The deputies of the Commons did the same, and peace was restored.

The king's speech was followed by another short one from the keeper
of the seals, which received but little attention; and by one of
prodigious length from Necker, which was equally injudicious and
unacceptable to his hearers, both in what it said and in what it
omitted.

He never mentioned the question of constitutional reform. He said
nothing of what the Commons, at least, thought still more
important--the number of chambers in which the members were
to meet; and, though he dilated at the most profuse length on the
condition of the finances, and on his own success in re-establishing
public credit, they were by no means pleased to hear him assert
that success had removed any absolute necessity for their meeting
at all, and that they had only been called together in fulfillment
of the king's promise, that so the sovereign might establish a
better harmony between the different parts of the Constitution.

Before any business could be proceeded with, it was necessary
for the members to have the writs of their elections properly
certified and registered, for which they were to meet on the
following day.

We need not here detail the artifices and assumptions by which
the members of the Third Estate put forward pretensions which were
designed to make them masters of the whole Assembly; nor is it
necessary to unfold at length the combination of audacity and craft,
aided by the culpable weakness of Necker, by which they ultimately
carried the point they contended for, providing that the three
orders should deliberate and vote together as one united body in
one chamber.

Emboldened by their success, they even proceeded to a step which
probably not one among them had originally contemplated; and, as
if one of their principal objects had been to disown the authority
of the king by which they had been called together, they repudiated
the title of States-general, and invented for themselves a new name,
that of "The National Assembly," which, as it had never been heard
of before, seemed to mark that they owed their existence to the
nation, and not to the sovereign.

But the discussions that took place before all these points were
settled, presented, besides the importance of the conclusion
which was adopted, another feature of powerful interest, since it
was in them that the members first heard the voice of the Count de
Mirabeau, who, more than any other deputy, was supposed during the
ensuing year to be able to sway the whole Assembly, and to hold the
destinies of the nation in his hands.

Necker's daughter, the celebrated Baroness de Staël, wife of the
Swedish embassador, who was present at the opening of the States,
which, as her father's daughter, she regarded with exulting confidence
as the body of legislators who were to regenerate the nation,
remarked, as the long procession passed before her eyes, that of
the six hundred deputies of the Commons[7], the Count de Mirabeau
alone bore a name which was previously known; and he was manifestly
out of his place as a representative of the Commons.

His history was a strange one. He was the eldest son of a Provençal
noble, of Italian origin, great wealth, and a ferocious eccentricity
of character, which made him one of the worst possible instructors
for a youth of brilliant talents, unbridled passions, and a disposition
equally impetuous in its pursuit of good and of evil.

Even before he arrived at manhood he had become notorious for every
kind of profligacy; while his father, in an almost equal
degree, provoked the censure of those who interested themselves
in the career of a youth of undeniable ability, by punishments
of such severity as wore the appearance of vengeance rather
than of fatherly correction. In six or seven years he
obtained no fewer than fifteen warrants, or letters under
seal, for the imprisonment of his son in different jails or
fortresses, while the young man seemed to take a wanton pleasure
in showing how completely all efforts for his reformation
were thrown away.

Though unusually ugly (he himself compared his face to that
of a tiger who had had the small-pox), he was irresistible among
women. While one of the youngest subalterns in the army, he made
love, rarely without success, to the mistresses or wives of his
superior officers, and fought duel after duel with those who took
offense at his gallantries, From one castle in which he was imprisoned
he was aided to escape by the wife of an officer of the garrison,
who accompanied his flight.

From another he was delivered by the love of a lady of the
highest rank, the Marchioness de Monnier, whom he had met
at the governor's table.

When, after some years of misery, the marchioness terminated
them by suicide, he seduced a nun of exquisite beauty to leave her
convent for his sake; and as France was no longer a safe residence
for them, he fled to Frederick of Prussia, who, equally glad to
welcome him as a Frenchman, a genius, and a profligate, received
him for a while into high favor.

But he was penniless; and Frederick was never liberal of his money.

Debt soon drove him from Prussia, and he retired to England,
where he made acquaintance with Fox, Fitzpatrick, and other men
of mark in the political circles of the day. He was at all
times and amidst all his excesses both observant and studious;
and while witnessing in person the strife of parties in this
country, he learned to appreciate the excellencies of our Constitution,
both in its theory and in its practical working.

But presently debt drove him from London as it had driven him from
Berlin; and, after taking refuge for a short time in Holland and
Switzerland, he was hesitating whither next to betake himself, when,
hearing of the elections for the States-general, he resolved to
offer himself as a candidate; and returned to Provence to seek the
suffrages of the Nobles of his own county.

Unluckily, his character was too well known in his native
district; and the Nobles, unwilling to countenance the ambition
of one who had obtained so evil a notoriety, rejected him.

Full of indignation, he turned to the Third Estate, offering himself
as a representative of the Commons. In his speeches to the
citizens of Aix and Marseilles--for he canvassed both towns--he
inveighed against Necker and the Government with an eloquence
which electrified his audience, who had never before been
addressed in the language of independence.
But at the same moment Harold rose and, throwing his paper down,
came toward her.

"Evie, dear," he said, bending and putting his arms about her, "I
hope you're not thinking about last night---" She moved close to
him, trembling. "I know," he continued, "it was just an
imprudent friendship on your part. We all make mistakes."

Evylyn hardly heard him. She was wondering if by sheer clinging
to him she could draw him out and up the stairs. She thought of
playing sick, asking to be carried up--unfortunately she knew he
would lay her on the couch and bring her whiskey.

Suddenly her nervous tension moved up a last impossible notch.
She had heard a very faint but quite unmistakable creak from the
floor of the dining room. Fred was trying to get out the back
way.

Then her heart took a flying leap as a hollow ringing note like a
gong echoed and re-echoed through the house. Gedney's arm had
struck the big cut-glass bowl.

"What's that!" cried Harold. "Who's there?"

She clung to him but he broke away, and the room seemed to crash
about her ears. She heard the pantry-door swing open, a scuffle,
the rattle of a tin pan, and in wild despair she rushed into the
kitchen and pulled up the gas. Her husband's arm slowly unwound
from Gedney's neck, and he stood there very still, first in
amazement, then with pain dawning in his face.

"My golly!" he said in bewilderment, and then repeated: "My
GOLLY!"

He turned as if to jump again at Gedney, stopped, his muscles
visibly relaxed, and he gave a bitter little laugh.

"You people--you people---" Evylyn's arms were around him and her
eyes were pleading with him frantically, but he pushed her away
and sank dazed into a kitchen chair, his face like porcelain.
"You've been doing things to me, Evylyn. Why, you little devil!
You little DEVIL!"

She had never felt so sorry for him; she had never loved him so
much.

"It wasn't her fault," said Gedney rather humbly. "I just came."
But Piper shook his head, and his expression when he stared up
was as if some physical accident had jarred his mind into a
temporary inability to function. His eyes, grown suddenly
pitiful, struck a deep, unsounded chord in Evylyn--and
simultaneously a furious anger surged in her. She felt her
eyelids burning; she stamped her foot violently; her hands
scurried nervously over the table as if searching for a weapon,
and then she flung herself wildly at Gedney.

"Get out!" she screamed, dark eves blazing, little fists beating
helplessly on his outstretched arm. "You did this! Get out of
here--get out--get OUT! GET OUT!"


II


Concerning Mrs. Harold Piper at thirty-five, opinion was
divided--women said she was still handsome; men said she was
pretty no longer. And this was probably because the qualities in
her beauty that women had feared and men had followed had
vanished. Her eyes were still as large and as dark and as sad,
but the mystery had departed; their sadness was no longer
eternal, only human, and she had developed a habit, when she was
startled or annoyed, of twitching her brows together and blinking
several times. Her mouth also had lost: the red had receded and
the faint down-turning of its corners when she smiled, that had
added to the sadness of the eyes and been vaguely mocking and
beautiful, was quite gone. When she smiled now the corners of her
lips turned up. Back in the days when she revelled in her own
beauty Evylyn had enjoyed that smile of hers--she had accentuated
it. When she stopped accentuating it, it faded out and the last
of her mystery with it.

Evylyn had ceased accentuating her smile within a month after the
Freddy Gedney affair. Externally things had gone an very much as
they had before. But in those few minutes during which she had
discovered how much she loved her husband, Evylyn had realized how
indelibly she had hurt him. For a month she struggled against
aching silences, wild reproaches and accusations--she pled with
him, made quiet, pitiful little love to him, and he laughed at
her bitterly--and then she, too, slipped gradually into silence
and a shadowy, impenetrable barrier dropped between them. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL EXECUTIVE.--The President is the head
of the Federal executive, but in the performance of his numerous
administrative duties he is aided by a number of subordinate
officers.

No executive departments were directly established
by the Constitution, but that document evidently assumes their
existence, for it clearly states that the President "may
require the opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in
each of the executive departments, upon any subject relating
to the duties of their respective offices." [Footnote: Article
II, Section II, of the Constitution.]
President Washington was authorized by Congress to appoint three
assistants: a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Treasury, and
a Secretary of War.

With the development of governmental functions, additional
departments have been created. Congress established the Post
Office Department in 1794, the Navy Department in 1798, the
Department of the Interior in 1849, the Department of Justice
in 1870, the Department of Agriculture in 1889, the Department
of Commerce in 1903, and the Department of Labor in 1913.

At present, then, there are ten Federal executive departments, all
of them under the direct control of the President.

521. THE CABINET.--The heads of these ten departments are appointed
by the President, nominally with the consent of the Senate. They
may be removed only by the President, and by him at will.
Neither in the Constitution nor in the statutes of Congress
is there provision for a Cabinet, but as the result of custom
which has been formulating since Washington's second term the heads
of the Federal executive departments have come to constitute, in
their collective capacity, the President's Cabinet.

Cabinet meetings are generally held twice a week, or oftener, as
the President desires.

The American Cabinet should not be confused with the Cabinet in
Great Britain and other European countries.

In Europe the Cabinet is generally a parliamentary ministry, that
is to say, a group of men chosen from the majority party in the
legislature.

These Cabinet members, or ministers, sit in the legislature,
propose laws, and defend their measures on the floor.

They are held responsible for the national administration.

This means that when the majority of the legislature fails to support
them they are expected to resign, in order that the opposition
party may form a new Cabinet.

Quite different is the American Cabinet.

This body is advisory only, and the President may disregard the
advice of any or all of its members. The Cabinet in this country
is accountable only to the President. The attitude of Congress
toward Cabinet officers has nothing to do with the tenure of office
of these executive heads.

Cabinet members do not sit in Congress; they do not, in the capacity
of Cabinet officers, introduce or defend legislation; and they are
not held responsible for the administration.

522.

HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AS ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS.

--Collectively the heads of the ten executive departments act as
the President's Cabinet; individually they administer their respective
departments.

Though responsible to the President and at all times working under
his direction, the heads of departments are allowed a wide range
of independence.

Department heads may appoint and remove at will a large number
of minor officers in their respective departments, though of late
years this power has been considerably restricted by Civil Service
rules.

The exact scope of the work of the various departments is largely
denned by law. Within the limits thus set, the head of the
department is free to make regulations affecting the conduct of
departmental business.

To expedite business, the work of each department is divided
and subdivided among numerous bureaus, boards, and commissions,
functioning under the general direction of the head of the
department.

523.

THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.--Without doubt the most important
of the subordinate executive officers is the Secretary of State.

His most pressing duty is to conduct foreign affairs in accordance
with the wishes of the President. In pursuance of this duty,
the Secretary of State issues instructions to diplomatic and
consular officers, issues passports to American citizens going
abroad, and otherwise exercises control of matters touching foreign
relations.

Important domestic duties devolve upon the Secretary of State.
When the President desires to communicate with the Governors of
the several states, he acts through the Secretary of State.

The Secretary is the custodian of the Great Seal of the United
States. It is he who oversees the publication of the Federal
statutes.

The Secretary of State likewise has charge of the archives containing
the originals of all laws, treaties, and foreign correspondence.

Much of the work of the Department of State is performed through
bureaus, the titles of which indicate their respective functions.

Of these bureaus the following are the more important: the diplomatic
bureau, the consular bureau, the bureau of accounts, the bureau
of indexes and archives, the bureau of rolls and
library, the bureau of appointments, and the bureau of citizenship.

Each of these bureaus is headed by a chief who is directly
responsible to the Secretary of State.

In addition to these chiefs of bureaus, the Secretary is aided by
three assistant secretaries of state.

524.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY.--Supervision of the national finances
is the chief business of the Secretary of the Treasury. The
Secretary annually submits to Congress estimates of probable
receipts and expenditures, and supervises the collection of
customs and internal revenues. He also issues warrants for all
moneys paid out of the treasury.

The scope of the department's work may be indicated by an enumeration
of its chief officers. These include the Secretary himself,
three assistant secretaries, six auditors, the treasurer, the
comptroller of the treasury, the director of the mint, the register,
the comptroller of the currency, the commissioner of internal
revenue, the director of the bureau of engraving and printing, the
chief of the secret-service department, the captain commandant of
the coast guard, the superintendent of the life-saving service, the
surgeon-general of the public health service, the supervising
architect, and the farm loan commissioner.

525.

THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR.

--National defense is the chief concern of the Secretary of War.
Coast fortifications, the supervision of navigation, and
river and harbor improvements fall within the scope of the
department. Our insular possessions are administered by the
Secretary of War. It is also the duty of this officer to prepare
estimates of the expenses of his department, to supervise all
expenditures for the support and transportation of the army, and
to take charge of the issuance of orders for the movement of troops.

In addition, he has charge of the Military Academy at West Point,
and recommends all appointments and promotions in the army service.

Under the Secretary of War are grouped a number of administrative
bureaus, each headed by an army officer detailed for a period of
four years.

Of these officers the following are the more important: the
inspector-general, the quartermaster-general, the adjutant general,
the surgeon-general, the chief of engineers, the chief of ordnance,
the chief signal officer, the chief of the coast artillery, the
judge advocate general, the provost-marshal general, and the chief
of the bureau of insular affairs.

526.

THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY.

--The Department of the Navy is likewise concerned with national
defense.

While less important than the Department of War, the Department of
the Navy is steadily gaining in prestige.

The Department is in charge of a Secretary, aided by an assistant
secretary.

It is the duty of the Department of the Navy to superintend the
construction and armament of war vessels, and in addition
exercise a supervisory control over the naval service. The
Naval Academy at Annapolis and the Naval War College at Newport
are in charge of the Department of the Navy.

The administrative work of the Department is carried on by
seven bureaus, most of them in charge of line officers of the
Navy, working directly under the Secretary. These bureaus are
as follows: the bureau of navigation, the bureau of ordnance,
the bureau of yards and docks, the bureau of supplies and accounts,
the bureau of steam engineering, the bureau of medicine and surgery,
and the bureau of construction and repairs.

527.

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.--This Department is headed by the
Attorney-General, who acts as the chief legal adviser of the
National government.

It is his duty to represent the government in all cases to which
the United States is a party.

It is he who conducts proceedings against corporations or individuals
who violate the Federal laws.

General supervision over all Federal district attorneys and
marshals is exercised by the Attorney-General. This officer
likewise examines the titles of lands which the government intends
to purchase.

The Attorney-General has a supervisory charge of the penal and
reformatory institutions which are Federal in character.

Applications for pardons by the President are investigated by the
Attorney-General.

Still another of his duties is to superintend the codification of
the Federal criminal laws.

In these various duties the Attorney-General is assisted by an
under- officer known as the solicitor-general.

528.

THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.

--This Department, headed by the Postmaster-General, has general
charge of the postal service.

The Postmaster-General awards contracts for the transportation of
the mails, and directs the management of the domestic and foreign
mail service.

The handling of money orders, the parcels post system, and the
postal savings banks come under the control of the Postmaster-
General. Of great importance is the power of this officer
to bar from the mails publications which are fraudulent or otherwise
obnoxious.

Working under the Postmaster-General are four assistant postmasters-
general, each in general charge of a group of services within the
department.

529. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.--Aided by two assistant
secretaries, the Secretary of the Interior performs a number of
important functions. He has charge of all public lands,
including national parks. The handling of Indian affairs
constitutes one of his duties.
The territories of Alaska and Hawaii come under the direct
supervision of this department.

Many miscellaneous functions are performed by the various bureaus
within the department.

Patents, pensions, and the geological survey come within the
purview of the department. The Secretary of the Interior has charge
of the distribution of government appropriations to various
educational institutions.

A general supervision over a number of charitable institutions
within the District of Columbia is also exercised by this
officer.

530.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

--All matters pertaining to agriculture in the widest sense are the
concern of the Department of Agriculture.
Under the direction of the Secretary the Department issues
a large number of scientific and technical publications, including
the Agricultural Yearbook, the series of Farmers' Bulletins, the
Monthly Weather Review, and the Crop Reporter. Quarantine
stations for imported cattle, and the inspection of domestic meats
and imported food products are concerns of the various bureaus
within the Department.

Of great importance is the work of the weather bureau in sending
out storm, flood, frost, and drought warnings.

An increasingly important phase of the Department's work is
the Forest Service, the work of which has been described in Chapter
XXX. An important bureau is the bureau of animal industry,
which combats animal diseases and gives advice concerning the best
breeds of poultry and cattle.

The bureau of plant industry ransacks the world for new crops
suitable for our soils, and gives fruit-growers and farmers advice
concerning plant parasites. Insect pests are the concern of the
entomology division.

Additional functions of the Department of Agriculture may be indicated
by an enumeration of some of the more important of its remaining
bureaus and divisions.

These include the bureau of chemistry, the bureau of soils, the
bureau of statistics, the bureau of crop estimates, the office
of public roads and rural engineering, the Federal horticultural
board, and the bureau of markets.

531.

THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE.--In 1913 what for ten years had
been known as the Department of Commerce and Labor was divided
into two separate departments, a Department of Commerce and a
Department of Labor.

The chief duty of the Department of Commerce is to foster the foreign
and domestic commerce of the United States.

To promote our mining, manufacturing and fishing industries,
and to develop our transportation facilities are, therefore,
among the aims of this department.

The census, the coast survey and lighthouses, and steamboat
inspection are concerns of the Department of Commerce. The
scope of the Department, which is increasing rapidly, may be
indicated by an enumeration of the more important bureaus grouped
within it.
These include the bureau of foreign and domestic commerce, the
bureau of census, the bureau of lighthouses, the bureau of
coast and geodetic survey, the steamboat inspection service,
the bureau of navigation, the bureau of standards, and the bureau
of fisheries.

532.

THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR.

--Though at present the functions of the Department of Labor
are fewer than those of the other Departments, they are being
rapidly expanded by the extension of government interest in industry.

The Department is concerned with practically all matters which
affect labor conditions in the United States.

The Department of Labor collects and publishes information upon
all subjects connected with labor and capital, the hours and
wages of labor, and methods of improving the condition of the
working classes.
It seeks to encourage industrial good will, and to adjust labor
disputes peaceably.

An important bureau within the Department is the bureau of
immigration, which, under the direction of the commissioner- general
of immigration, is concerned with the administration of our immigration
laws.

The bureau of naturalization keeps a record of immigrants, and
supervises their naturalization.

Of growing importance is the children's bureau, which investigates
matters having to do with child labor, infant mortality, orphanage,
and the work of the juvenile courts.

533.

MISCELLANEOUS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.--In addition to the
executive departments which have been briefly discussed, the
Federal administration includes many independent boards, bureaus,
and commissions which perform duties not assigned to any of the
ten departments.

These agencies have been established from time to time under the
authority of Congressional statutes. The chiefs of the bureaus
and the members of the boards and commissions are appointed by the
President and the Senate, most of them for a term ranging between
six and twelve years.

These officials are largely experts, who happily are sufficiently
exempt from the spoils system to stand a fair chance of
surviving a change of administration.

Among the more important of these boards and commissions are
the following: The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Farm Loan
Board, the Federal Board for Vocational Education, the Federal Trade
Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the United States
Tariff Commission, and the Civil Service Commission.

The nature and functions of most of these administrative agencies

At four, leaving Hilda by the bedside, she went to her room, and
slipping with a shudder out of her evening dress, kicked it into a
corner. She put on a house dress and returned to the nursery
while Hilda went to make coffee.

Not until noon could she bring herself to look into Harold's
room, but when she did it was to find him awake and staring very
miserably at the ceiling. He turned blood-shot hollow eyes upon
her. For a minute she hated him, couldn't speak. A husky voice
came from the bed.

"What time is it?"

"Noon."

"I made a damn fool---"

"It doesn't matter," she said sharply. "Julie's got
blood-poisoning. They may"--she choked over the words--"they
think she'll have to lose her hand."

"What?"

"She cut herself on that--that bowl."

"Last night?"

"Oh, what does it matter?" see cried; "she's got blood-poisoning.
Can't you hear?" He looked at her bewildered--sat half-way up
in bed.

"I'll get dressed," he said.

Her anger subsided and a great wave of weariness and pity for him
rolled over her. After all, it was his trouble, too."

"Yes," she answered listlessly, "I suppose you'd better."


IV


If Evylyn's beauty had hesitated an her early thirties it came to
an abrupt decision just afterward and completely left her. A
tentative outlay of wrinkles on her face suddenly deepened and
flesh collected rapidly on her legs and hips and arms. Her
mannerism of drawing her brows together had become an
expression--it was habitual when she was reading or speaking and
even while she slept. She was forty-six.

As in most families whose fortunes have gone down rather than up,
she and Harold had drifted into a colorless antagonism. In
repose they looked at each other with the toleration they might
have felt for broken old chairs; Evylyn worried a little when he
was sick and did her best to be cheerful under the wearying
depression of living with a disappointed man.

Family bridge was over for the evening and she sighed with
relief. She had made more mistakes than usual this evening and
she didn't care. Irene shouldn't have made that remark about the
infantry being particularly dangerous. There had been no letter
for three weeks now, and, while this was nothing out of the
ordinary, it never failed to make her nervous; naturally she
hadn't known how many clubs were out.

Harold had gone up-stairs, so she stepped out on the porch for a
breath of fresh air. There was a bright glamour of moonlight
diffusing on the sidewalks and lawns, and with a little half
yawn, half laugh, she remembered one long moonlight affair of her
youth. It was astonishing to think that life had once been the
sum of her current love-affairs. It was now the sum of her
current problems.

There was the problem of Julie--Julie was thirteen, and lately
she was growing more and more sensitive about her deformity and
preferred to stay always in her room reading. A few years before
she had been frightened at the idea of going to school, and
Evylyn could not bring herself to send her, so she grew up in her
mother's shadow, a pitiful little figure with the artificial
hand that she made no attempt to use but kept forlornly in her
pocket. Lately she had been taking lessons in using it because
Evylyn had feared she would cease to lift the arm altogether, but
after the lessons, unless she made a move with it in listless
obedience to her mother, the little hand would creep back to the
pocket of her dress. For a while her dresses were made without
pockets, but Julie had moped around the house so miserably at a
loss all one month that Evylyn weakened and never tried the
experiment again.

The problem of Donald had been different from the start.  She had
attempted vainly to keep him near her as she had tried to teach
Julie to lean less on her--lately the problem of Donald had been
snatched out of her hands; his division had been abroad for three
months.

She yawned again--life was a thing for youth.  What a happy youth
she must have had!  She remembered her pony, Bijou, and the trip
to Europe with her mother when she was eighteen---

"Very, very complicated," she said aloud and severely to the
moon, and, stepping inside, was about to close the door when she
heard a noise in the library and started.

It was Martha, the middle-aged servant: they kept only one now.

"Why, Martha!" she said in surprise.

Martha turned quickly.

Evylyn sat down on the edge of the table and stared at it
fascinated. It seemed to be smiling now, a very cruel smile, as
if to say:

"You see, this time I didn't have to hurt you directly. I didn't
bother. You know it was I who took your son away. You know how
cold I am and how hard and how beautiful, because once you were
just as cold and hard and beautiful."

The bowl seemed suddenly to turn itself over and then to distend
and swell until it became a great canopy that glittered and
trembled over the room, over the house, and, as the walls melted
slowly into mist, Evylyn saw that it was still moving out, out
and far away from her, shutting off far horizons and suns and
moons and stars except as inky blots seen faintly through it. And
under it walked all the people, and the light that came through
to them was refracted and twisted until shadow seamed light and
light seemed shadow--until the whole panoply of the world became
changed and distorted under the twinkling heaven of
the bowl.

laid a hand on his shoulder and a glow settled almost
imperceptibly over him.

"Warren," she whispered "do something for me--dance with Bernice.
She's been stuck with little Otis Ormonde for almost an
hour."

Warren's glow faded.

"Why--sure," he answered half-heartedly.

"You don't mind, do you? I'll see that you don't get stuck."

"'Sall right."

Marjorie smiled--that smile that was thanks enough.

"You're an angel, and I'm obliged loads."

With a sigh the angel glanced round the veranda, but Bernice and
Otis were not in sight. He wandered back inside, and there in
front of the women's dressing-room he found Otis in the centre of
a group of young men who were convulsed with laughter. Otis was
brandishing a piece of timber he had picked up, and discoursing
volubly.

"She's gone in to fix her hair," he announced wildly. "I'm
waiting to dance another hour with her."

Their laughter was renewed.

"Why don't some of you cut in?" cried Otis resentfully. "She
likes more variety."

"Why, Otis," suggested a friend "you've just barely got used to
her."

"Why the two-by-four, Otis?" inquired Warren, smiling.

"The two-by-four? Oh, this? This is a club. When she comes out
I'll hit her on the head and knock her in again."

Warren collapsed on a settee and howled with glee.

"Never mind, Otis," he articulated finally. "I'm relieving you
this time."

Otis simulated a sudden fainting attack and handed the stick to
Warren.

"If you need it, old man," he said hoarsely.

No matter how beautiful or brilliant a girl may be, the
reputation of not being frequently cut in on makes her position
at a dance unfortunate. Perhaps boys prefer her company to that
of the butterflies with whom they dance a dozen times an but,
youth in this jazz-nourished generation is temperamentally
restless, and the idea of fox-trotting more than one full fox
trot with the same girl is distasteful, not to say odious. .

most girls she had been brought up on the warm milk prepared by
Annie Fellows Johnston and on novels in which the female was
beloved because of certain mysterious womanly qualities always
mentioned but never displayed.

Bernice felt a vague pain that she was not at present engaged in
being popular. She did not know that had it not been for
Marjorie's campaigning she would have danced the entire evening
with one man; but she knew that even in Eau Claire other girls
with less position and less pulchritude were given a much bigger
rush. She attributed this to something subtly unscrupulous in
those girls. It had never worried her, and if it had her mother
would have assured her that the other girls cheapened themselves
and that men really respected girls like Bernice.

She turned out the light in her bathroom, and on an impulse
decided to go in and chat for a moment with her aunt Josephine,
whose light was still on. Her soft slippers bore her noiselessly
down the carpeted hall, but hearing voices inside she stopped
near the partly openers door. Then she caught her own name, and
without any definite intention of eavesdropping lingered--and the
thread of the conversation going on inside pierced her
consciousness sharply as if it had been drawn through with a
needle.

"She's absolutely hopeless!" It was Marjorie's voice. "Oh, I know
what you're going to say! So many people have told you how
pretty and sweet she is, and how she can cook! What of it? She
has a bum time. Men don't like her."

"What's a little cheap popularity?"

Mrs. Harvey sounded annoyed.

--Parties seem to be inevitable, for no one funniest
has yet shown how representative government can be carried on

Support of the party for the realization of its program on these

435. NOMINATION BY CAUCUS.--One of the earliest methods of
choosing party candidates in this country was by means of the.

The caucus was an informal meeting in which the local members of a
political party nominated candidates for town and county offices.

Candidates for state offices were named by a legislative caucus,
in which legislators belonging of both nation and states there
continues to be I a legislative caucus, but its influence upon the
choice public officials has greatly diminished.

Outside of the state and National legislatures the caucus is now
found only in towns, wards, and other small areas.. In these
areas it is used for the purpose of nominating candidates for local
offices, and for the purpose of electing delegates to nominating
conventions.

I Except. in some parts of New England, it should be noted, this
local caucus is now generally known as the primary. 436.

RISE OF THE NOMINATING CONVENTION.

--After 1825 the caucus was largely by the convention.

The convention is a relatively large meeting of party delegates
chosen for the express purpose deciding upon party policies and
candidates.

The convention device was developed, partly because party the caucus,
and partly because the increasing population of the country
necessitated larger congregations of" party members.

The convention was made possible by improved means of transportation,
which allowed relatively large groups of individuals to come together
for party candidates.

Thus the Direct Primary is really an election within the party
regarded, held for the purpose of allowing party members to choose
the candidates way to the convention continued exist for the defects
of party government, you and_The Rise and Growth of American

Characteristics of the political party.( Ray,_Introduction to

hand, party members do not to be chosen in local caucuses, where
the party"ring" or machine usually determined the choice of delegates.
night Bosses prepared" slates," bribed delegates, and otherwise
manipulated what was supposed to be an expression of the party will
in convention.

In many cases the convention became-merely a cut-and-dried
affair in which party members ratified nominations previously
agreed upon by party leaders.

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, and especially
after regular election. When adopted, the Direct Primary
abolishes the convention by directly for their party's candidates.
Those individuals are nominated who receive deliberative
purposes. By 1850 all of the political parties had adopted the
convention 1900, these defects excite caucus, primary, and direct
primary are claimed easily confused.

We have seen that the local caucus is now generally strangely known
as the primary.

In most states the Direct Primary has their party. Integrity is
above party. The slogan," My party right or wrong" is not only
stupid but treasonable. Let the citizen be eager to coöperate
with his fellows for the advancement of common political views,
but let the corrupt party be abandoned. 433.

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL FOR PARTY ABUSES.

--Nothing could be more mistaken than the belief that defective
government is due primarily to the existence never of an entity
known as the political recently been placed under detailed legal
and Representatives, are often nominated by method.

In more than a third of the states the for one of the candidates
for the presidential nomination.

Altogether, the Direct Primary has largely supplanted the convention
in about three fourths of the states. 440.

ADVANTAGES CLAIMED FOR THE DIRECT PRIMARY.

--A number of important advantages are claimed for the Direct
Primary.

It is said in the direct selection whining of party candidates.

The local caucus or primary, the other hand, does not directly
select the more important party candidates, but can only choose
delegates to a nominating convention.

Because the Direct Primary increases the control of individual over
party policies, it encourages active political work on the part of
the rank file.

It is maintained that the Direct Primary brings out a larger
vote than would otherwise be possible. Better candidates are
secured by means of the Direct Primary, it is claimed, because the
nomination of individuals depends upon the presentation of their
claims to the voters, rather than upon winning the favor of party
bosses. 441.

OBJECTIONS URGED AGAINST THE DIRECT PRIMARY.

--The opponents of the plan claim that the Direct Primary has serious
faults. It is said that in the convention the Direct Primary
has made more difficult the exchange of views and opinions
among party members. has therefore broken down party
responsibility. It is claimed that the Direct Primary has not
eliminated the boss, for rather than voting directly for me
candidates of their own choice, electors must make a selection from
a list of candidates to defray the expense competing in the Direct
Primaries.

Frequently the"ring" brings out a number of candidates to divide
the voters, while the henchmen of the ring concentrate their votes
upon one man.

Lastly, it is pointed out, the excessive number of candidates to
be selected renders it impossible for the, but at the present
time state officers, and the Direct Primary, the primary
seems to afford protection against the worst fault of the convention,
which was the frequent selection of incapable and corrupt!

candidates at the behest of a few political leaders.

But it has not, in twenty years or more of experience, demonstrated
that it it can achieve positive results of a measurably satisfactory
character.

It has not rid the state of boss domination; it has increased the
expense. 4. Munro,_The Government of the United States_,

whether he be a professional politician or not.

To say that the primary secures on the average somewhat better
results than the Marjorie old convention may be stating the truth,
but it is not high praise." 443.

NOMINATION BY PETITION.--The system of nomination by petition came
into use between 1880 and 1890. It provides that candidates
may be placed in nomination by filing with some specified
officer nomination papers, or petitions, signed by a specified
number of qualified voters. The filing of these papers entitles
the all candidates named thereon to determining which you would
prefer to Parties and Practical Politics_, chapter i.) 10.

The spoils system when individuals neglect to perform their civic
duties. The failure to vote, or serve office when the opportunity
offers, the failure either an to protest against way candidates
chosen unfairly, or to demand an accounting of have their
names printed upon the official ballot. The merit of this device
is that it prevents the party machine from dictating the
choice of All candidates, and that it enables independent
candidates to be brought backward. On the other hand, it has
encouraged the circulation of petitions for hire.

On the whole this method of nomination is proving more and more
popular in local elections.

It seems well adapted to the needs of municipalities, for it reduces
partisanship to a minimum. It is said that in some cases
practically eliminates national sobs politics from local elections.
The supporters of nomination by petition are increasing, and
her it is now proposed to apply it to all local and chapters
lxv and lxvii who will represent the party at the approaching plan
for the nomination of candidates for most local, state, and National,
offices. 437.

DECLINE OF THE CONVENTION.

--The convention was an improvement upon the caucus in that it
allowed a greater number of party members to participate in
nominations.

Unfortunately, delegates; Ray,_Introduction to Political Parties
and Practical Politics_, chapter xiv.) 12."

Why come the best men do not state nominations. In such an event
the Direct Primary would be radically modified, or even abolished.
444.

MAJORITY REPRESENTATION.--How can we make certain that an individual
nominated or elected represents a majority of all those voting?

When there are only two candidates, the one receiving the largest
number of votes both a plurality and a majority.

But when there n't are several candidates A, it often happens that
the individual receiving largest. number of votes does not receive
a majority.

Suppose, for example, that 100,000 votes are cast But he has not
received a_majority_ of the ballot.

This custom of declaring successful the candidate receiving a
plurality constitutes a defect in our mistake--it representative
system, since a plurality candidate may represent only a small
minority of those actually voting.

Several attempts have been made to remedy this defect.
But to offset that unfortunate occurrence Bernice had several
signal successes to her credit. Little Otis Ormonde pleaded off
from a trip East and elected instead to follow her with a
puppylike devotion, to the amusement of his crowd and to the
irritation of G. Reece Stoddard, several of whose afternoon calls
Otis completely ruined by the disgusting tenderness of the
glances he bent on Bernice. He even told her the story of the
two-by-four and the dressing-room to show her how frightfully
mistaken he and every one else had been in their first judgment
of her. Bernice laughed off that incident with a slight sinking
sensation.

Of all Bernice's conversation perhaps the best known and most
universally approved was the line about the bobbing of her hair.

"Oh, Bernice, when you goin' to get the hair bobbed?"

"Day after to-morrow maybe," she would reply, laughing. "Will you
come and see me? Because I'm counting on you, you know."

"Will we? You know! But you better hurry up."

Bernice, whose tonsorial intentions were strictly dishonorable,
would laugh again.

"Pretty soon now. You'd be surprised."

But perhaps the most significant symbol of her success was the
gray car of the hypercritical Warren McIntyre, parked daily in
front of the Harvey house. At first the parlor-maid was
distinctly startled when he asked for Bernice instead of
Marjorie; after a week of it she told the cook that Miss Bernice
had gotta holda Miss Marjorie's best fella.

And Miss Bernice had. Perhaps it began with Warren's desire to
rouse jealousy in Marjorie; perhaps it was the familiar though
unrecognized strain of Marjorie in Bernice's conversation;
perhaps it was both of these and something of sincere attraction
besides. But somehow the collective mind of the younger set knew
within a week that Marjorie's most reliable beau had made an
amazing face-about and was giving an indisputable rush to
Marjorie's guest. The question of the moment was how Marjorie
would take it. Warren called Bernice on the 'phone twice a day,
sent her notes, and they were frequently seen together in his
roadster, obviously engrossed in one of those tense, significant
conversations as to whether or not he was sincere.

Marjorie on being twitted only laughed. She said she was mighty
glad that Warren had at last found some one who appreciated him.
So the younger set laughed, too, and guessed that Marjorie didn't
care and let it go at that.

One afternoon when there were only three days left of her visit
Bernice was waiting in the hall for Warren, with whom she was
going to a bridge party. She was in rather a blissful mood, and
when Marjorie--also bound for the party--appeared beside her and
began casually to adjust her hat in the mirror, Bernice was
utterly unprepared for anything in the nature of a clash.
Marjorie did her work very coldly and succinctly in three
sentences.

"You may as well get Warren out of your head," she said coldly.

"What?" Bernice was utterly astounded.

"You may as well stop making a fool of yourself over Warren
McIntyre. He doesn't care a snap of his fingers about you."

For a tense moment they regarded each other--Marjorie scornful,
aloof; Bernice astounded, half-angry, half-afraid. Then two cars
drove up in front of the house and there was a riotous honking.
Both of them gasped faintly, turned, and side by side hurried
out.

All through the bridge party Bernice strove in vain to master a
rising uneasiness. She had offended Marjorie, the sphinx of
sphinxes. With the most wholesome and innocent intentions in the
world she had stolen Marjorie's property. She felt suddenly and
horribly guilty. After the bridge game, when they sat in an
informal circle and the conversation became general, the storm
gradually broke. Little Otis Ormonde inadvertently precipitated
it.

"When you going back to kindergarten, Otis?" some one had asked.

"Me? Day Bernice gets her hair bobbed."

"Then your education's over," said Marjorie quickly. "That's only
a bluff of hers. I should think you'd have realized."

"That a fact?" demanded Otis, giving Bernice a reproachful
glance.

Bernice's ears burned as she tried to think up an effectual
come-back. In the face of this direct attack her imagination was
paralyzed.

"There's a lot of bluffs in the world," continued Marjorie quite
pleasantly. "I should think you'd be young enough to know that,
Otis."

"Well," said Otis, "maybe so. But gee!  With a line like
Bernice's---"

"Really?" yawned Marjorie. "What's her latest bon mot?"

No one seemed to know. In fact, Bernice, having trifled with her
muse's beau, had said nothing memorable of late.

"Was that really all a line?" asked Roberta curiously.

Bernice hesitated. She felt that wit in some form was demanded of
her, but under her cousin's suddenly frigid eyes she was
completely incapacitated.

"I don't know," she stalled.

"Splush!" said Marjorie. "Admit it!"

Bernice saw that Warren's eyes had left a ukulele he had been
tinkering with and were fixed on her questioningly.

"Oh, I don't know!" she repeated steadily. Her cheeks were
glowing.

"Splush!" remarked Marjorie again.

"Come through, Bernice," urged Otis. "Tell her where to get off."
Bernice looked round again--she seemed unable to get away from
Warren's eyes.

"I like bobbed hair," she said hurriedly, as if he had asked her
a question, "and I intend to bob mine."

"When?" demanded Marjorie.

"Any time."

"No time like the present," suggested Roberta.

Otis jumped to his feet.

"Good stuff!" he cried. "We'll have a summer bobbing party.
Sevier Hotel barber-shop, I think you said."

In an instant all were on their feet. Bernice's heart throbbed
violently.

"What?" she gasped.

Out of the group came Marjorie's voice, very clear and
contemptuous.

"Don't worry--she'll back out!"

"Come on, Bernice!" cried Otis, starting toward the door.

Four eyes--Warren's and Marjorie's--stared at her, challenged
her, defied her. For another second she wavered wildly.

"All right," she said swiftly "I don't care if I do."

An eternity of minutes later, riding down-town through the late
afternoon beside Warren, the others following in Roberta's car
close behind, Bernice had all the sensations of Marie Antoinette
bound for the guillotine in a tumbrel. Vaguely she wondered why
she did not cry out that it was all a mistake. It was all she
could do to keep from clutching her hair with both bands to
protect it from the suddenly hostile world. Yet she did neither.
Even the thought of her mother was no deterrent now. This was the
test supreme of her sportsmanship; her right to walk
unchallenged in the starry heaven of popular girls.

Warren was moodily silent, and when they came to the hotel he
drew up at the curb and nodded to Bernice to precede him out.
Roberta's car emptied a laughing crowd into the shop, which
presented two bold plate-glass windows to the street.

B. THE MAKING OF A FEDERAL LAW [Footnote: A more detailed
account of the law-making process may be found in Reed, _Form and
Functions of American Government_, Chapter XXII.]
555. HOW LEGISLATION IS INITIATED.--The course of congressional
legislation may be illustrated by following a bill through the
House of Representatives.

Any member of the House may introduce a bill by filing it with the clerk.
The title of the bill is printed in the _Journal and Record_, this
constituting a first "reading."

The bill is then delivered to the Speaker, who refers it to the
proper committee.

Once a bill has been passed to the committee its fate rests
largely with that body.
The committee may confer with certain administrative officers,
listen to individuals interested in the subject, summon and examine
other persons, and then reach a decision upon the bill.

The committee may amend the bill as it pleases.

If unfavorable to the measure, the committee may report it
adversely, or too late for legislative action.

Indeed, it may even fail to report it at all.

Theoretically the House may overrule the committee's decision on a
bill, but so generally are the committee's recommendations followed
by the House that the adverse action of the committee virtually
kills a bill.

556.

THE BILL IS REPORTED TO THE HOUSE.--Let us suppose that the committee
reports the bill back to the House. The measure is then placed
upon a calendar and here awaits its turn, unless the committee
on rules sees fit to direct the immediate attention of the House
to it. The second reading is an actual and full reading of the
bill for the purpose of allowing amendments to be offered. After
the second reading, which may result in the adoption of amendments,
the Speaker puts the motion, "Shall the bill be engrossed and read
a third time?"

Debate is then in order. If the vote which follows is in the
affirmative, the bill is read a third time, but only by title.
The question of passage is put by the Speaker immediately after
the third reading.

557. DEBATE UPON THE BILL.--Debate in the House of Representatives
has little influence upon most bills, the fate of a measure being
practically determined by the committee considering it.

Most speeches are frankly intended for political purposes, and
for circulation in the Congressional Record, rather than
as actual and positive influences upon the bill which is
being discussed.

Debate in the House is limited in several ways. No member may
spend more than an hour in debate upon any question, except
the member in charge of the bill. This member may have an additional
hour at the close.

In the committee of the whole, speeches are limited to five
minutes.

No member may speak more than once on the same subject without
special permission from the chair. The single exception to this
rule is the member who has introduced the bill.

Before debate begins, the chairman of the committee in charge
of the bill arranges, in consultation with the Speaker, a list
of members who are to be heard upon the bill. No other members
are ordinarily recognized by the Speaker in the ensuing
debate.

After a certain amount of discussion the member in charge
of the bill will generally move the previous question in order to
cut short the debate and bring the House to a direct vote upon the
question.

558.

THE VOTE.--In the House voting may be by any one of three
methods. Voting may be by "sound of voices." In this case the
Speaker calls in turn for the "ayes" and "noes," and decides by
the volume of the sound whether the motion has been carried or lost.

This is usually the method first employed, but either of the other
two methods may be demanded before or after voting by sound of
voices has been employed.

Voting may be by tellers.

When this is decided upon the members pass between tellers appointed
by the Speaker--those in the affirmative first--and are counted.

This method requires the demand of one fifth of a quorum.

Voting may be by yeas and nays.

In this event, the clerk calls the roll and each member, as
his name is reached, answers "aye" or "no," the vote then being
recorded.

The Constitution provides that one fifth of the members present may
demand the yeas and nays.
Bernice, you
should have waited until after the Deyo's dance--you should have
waited if you wanted to do that."

"It was sudden, Aunt Josephine. Anyway, why does it matter to
Mrs. Deyo particularly?"

"Why child," cried Mrs. Harvey, "in her paper on 'The Foibles of
the Younger Generation' that she read at the last meeting of the
Thursday Club she devoted fifteen minutes to bobbed hair. It's
her pet abomination. And the dance is for you and Marjorie!"

"I'm sorry."

"Oh, Bernice, what'll your mother say? She'll think I let you do
it."

"I'm sorry."

Dinner was an agony. She had made a hasty attempt with a
curling-iron, and burned her finger and much hair. She could see
that her aunt was both worried and grieved, and her uncle kept
saying, "Well, I'll be darned!" over and over in a hurt and
faintly hostile torte. And Marjorie sat very quietly, intrenched
behind a faint smile, a faintly mocking smile.

Somehow she got through the evening. Three boy's called; Marjorie
disappeared with one of them, and Bernice made a listless
unsuccessful attempt to entertain the two others--sighed
thankfully as she climbed the stairs to her room at half past
ten. What a day!

When she had undressed for the night the door opened and Marjorie
came in.

"Bernice," she said "I'm awfully sorry about the Deyo dance. I'll
give you my word of honor I'd forgotten all about it."

"'Sall right," said Bernice shortly. Standing before the mirror
she passed her comb slowly through her short hair.

"I'll take you down-town to-morrow," continued Marjorie, "and the
hairdresser'll fix it so you'll look slick. I didn't imagine
you'd go through with it. I'm really mighty sorry."

"Oh, 'sall right!"

"Still it's your last night, so I suppose it won't matter much."

Then Bernice winced as Marjorie tossed her own hair over her
shoulders and began to twist it slowly into two long blond braids
until in her cream-colored negligee she looked like a delicate
painting of some Saxon princess. Fascinated, Bernice watched the
braids grow. Heavy and luxurious they were moving under the
supple fingers like restive snakes--and to Bernice remained this
relic and the curling-iron and a to-morrow full of eyes. She
could see G. Reece Stoddard, who liked her, assuming his Harvard
manner and telling his dinner partner that Bernice shouldn't have
been allowed to go to the movies so much; she could see Draycott
Deyo exchanging glances with his mother and then being
conscientiously charitable to her. But then perhaps by to-morrow
Mrs. Deyo would have heard the news; would send round an icy
little note requesting that she fail to appear--and behind her
back they would all laugh and know that Marjorie had made a fool
of her; that her chance at beauty had been sacrificed to the
jealous whim of a selfish girl. She sat down suddenly before the
mirror, biting the inside of her cheek.

"I like it," she said with an effort. "I think it'll be
becoming."

Marjorie smiled.

"It looks all right. For heaven's sake, don't let it worry you!"

"I won't."

"Good night Bernice."

But as the door closed something snapped within Bernice. She
sprang dynamically to her feet, clinching her hands, then swiftly
and noiseless crossed over to her bed and from underneath it
dragged out her suitcase. Into it she tossed toilet articles and
a change of clothing, Then she turned to her trunk and quickly
dumped in two drawerfulls of lingerie and stammer dresses. She
moved quietly. but deadly efficiency, and in three-quarters of an
hour her trunk was locked and strapped and she was fully dressed
in a becoming new travelling suit that Marjorie had helped her
pick out.

Sitting down at her desk she wrote a short note to Mrs. Harvey,
in which she briefly outlined her reasons for going. She sealed
it, addressed it, and laid it on her pillow. She glanced at her
watch. The train left at one, and she knew that if she walked
down to the Marborough Hotel two blocks away she could easily get
a taxicab.

Suddenly she drew in her breath sharply and an expression flashed
into her eyes that a practiced character reader might have
connected vaguely with the set look she had worn in the barber's
chair--somehow a development of it. It was quite a new look for
Bernice--and it carried consequences.

She went stealthily to the bureau, picked up an article that lay
there, and turning out all the lights stood quietly until her
eyes became accustomed to the darkness. Softly she pushed open
the door to Marjorie's room. She heard the quiet, even breathing
of an untroubled conscience asleep.

She was by the bedside now, very deliberate and calm. She acted
swiftly. Bending over she found one of the braids of Marjorie's
hair, followed it up with her hand to the point nearest the head,
and then holding it a little slack so that the sleeper would
feel no pull, she reached down with the shears and severed it.
With the pigtail in her hand she held her breath. Marjorie had
muttered something in her sleep. Bernice deftly amputated the
other braid, paused for an instant, and then flitted swiftly and
silently back to her own room.

Down-stairs she opened the big front door, closed it carefully
behind her, and feeling oddly happy and exuberant stepped off the
porch into the moonlight, swinging her heavy grip like a
shopping-bag. After a minute's brisk walk she discovered that her
left hand still held the two blond braids. She laughed
unexpectedly--had to shut her mouth hard to keep from emitting an
absolute peal. She was passing Warren's house now, and on the
impulse she set down her baggage, and swinging the braids like
piece of rope flung them at the wooden porch, where they landed
with a slight thud. She laughed again, no longer restraining
herself.

"Huh," she giggled wildly. "Scalp the selfish thing!"

Then picking up her staircase she set off at a half-run down the
moonlit street.


Benediction


The Baltimore Station was hot and crowded, so Lois was forced to
stand by the telegraph desk for interminable, sticky seconds
while a clerk with big front teeth counted and recounted a large
lady's day message, to determine whether it contained the
innocuous forty-nine words or the fatal fifty-one.

In these moments of anguish she showed herself indeed a true
sister, and, the two clinging to one another the more the greater
their dangers and distresses became, a true sister she continued
to the end.

Meanwhile the embarrassments of the Government were daily assuming
a more formidable appearance. Calonne had for some time
endeavored to meet the deficiency of the revenue by raising fresh
loans, till he had completely exhausted the national credit; and
at last had been forced to admit that the scheme originally propounded
by Turgot, and subsequently in a more modified degree by Necker,
of abolishing the exemptions from taxation which were enjoyed by
the nobles--the privileged classes, as they were often called--was
the only expedient to save the nation from the disgrace and ruin
of total bankruptcy.

But, as it seemed probable that the nobles would resist such a
measure, and that their resistance would prove too strong for
him, as it had already been found to be for his predecessors, he
proposed to the king to revive an old assembly which had been
known by the title of the Notables; trusting that, if he succeeded
in obtaining the sanction of that body to his plans, the nobles
would hardly venture to insist on maintaining their privileges in
defiance of the recorded judgment of so respectable a council.

His hopes were disappointed. He might fairly have reckoned
on obtaining their concurrence, since it was the unquestioned
prerogative of the king to nominate
                                           all the members; but, even when he was most deliberate and resolute,
his rashness and carelessness were incurable.

He took no pains whatever to select members favorable to his
views; and the consequence was that, in March, 1787, in the
very first month of the session of the Notables, the whole body
protested against one of the taxes which he desired to impose;
and his enemies at once urged the king to dismiss him, basing
their recommendation on the practice of England, where,
as they affirmed, a minister who found himself in a minority on
an important question immediately retired from office.

Marie Antoinette, who, as we have seen, had been a diligent reader
of Hume, had also been led to compare the proceedings of the
refractory Notables with the conduct of our English parliamentary
parties, and to an English reader some of her comments can not fail
to be as interesting as they are curious.

The Duchess de Polignac was drinking the waters at Bath, which
at that time was a favorite resort of French valetudinarians,
and, while she was still in that most beautiful of English cities,
the queen kept up an occasional correspondence with her.

We have two letters which Marie Antoinette wrote to her in April;
one on the 9th, the very day on which Calonne was dismissed; the
second, two days latter; and even the passages which do not relate
to politics have their interest as specimens of the writer's
character, and of the sincere frankness with which she laid aside
her rank and believed in the possibility of a friendship of complete
equality.

"April 9th, 1787.

"I thank you, my dear heart, for your letter, which has done me good.

                                      I was anxious about you.

It is true, then, that you have not suffered much from your journey.

Take care of yourself, I insist on it, I beg of you; and be sure
and derive benefit from the waters, else I should repent of the
privation I have inflicted on myself without your health being
benefited.

When you are near I feel how much I love you; and I feel it much
more when you are far away.

I am greatly taken up with you and yours, and you would be very
ungrateful if you did not love me, for I can not change toward
you.

"Where you are you can at least enjoy the comfort of never hearing
of business. Although you are in the country of an Upper
and a Lower House, you can stop your ears and let people
talk.

But here it is a noise that deafens one in spite of all I can
do. The words 'opposition' and 'motions' are established
here as in the English Parliament, with this difference, that
in London, when people go into opposition, they begin by
denuding themselves of the favors of the king; instead of which,
here numbers oppose all the wise and beneficent views of the
most virtuous of masters, and still keep all he has given them.

It may be a cleverer way of managing, but it is not so
gentleman-like. The time of illusion is past, and we are tasting
cruel experience. We are paying dearly to-day for our zeal
and enthusiasm for the American war. The voice of honest men is
stifled by members and cabals. Men disregard principles to bind
themselves to words, and to multiply attacks on individuals. The
seditious will drag the State to its ruin rather than renounce
their intrigues."

And in her second letter she specifies some of the Opposition
by name; one of whom, as will be seen hereafter, contributed
greatly to her subsequent miseries.... "The repugnance which
you know that I have always had to interfering in business is
today put cruelly to the proof; and you would be as tired as I
am of all that goes on. I have already spoken to you of our
Upper and Lower House,[6] and of all the absurdities which take
place there, and of the nonsense which is talked.

To be loaded with benefits by the king, like M. de Beauvau, to
join the Opposition, and to surrender none of them, is what
is called having spirit and courage. It is, in truth, the courage
of infamy. I am wholly surrounded with folks who have revolted
from him. A duke,[7] a great maker of motions, a man who has
always a tear in his eye when he speaks, is one of the number.

M. de La Fayette always founds the opinions he expresses on what
is done at Philadelphia.... Even bishops and archbishops belong
to the Opposition, and a great many of the clergy are the very
soul of the cabal. You may judge, after this, of all the resources
which they employ to overturn the plans of the king and his
ministers."
Calonne, however, as has already been intimated, had been
dismissed from office before this last letter was written.

There had been a trial of strength between him and his enemies;
which he, believing that he had won the confidence of Louis
himself, reckoned on turning to his own advantage, by inducing the
king to dismiss those of his opponents who were in office.
To his astonishment, he found that Louis preferred dispensing with
his own services, and the general voice was probably correct
when it, affirmed that it was the queen who had induced him to
come to that decision.

Loménie de Brienne, Archbishop of Toulouse, was again a
candidate for the vacant post, and De Vermond was as diligent as
on the previous occasion[8] in laboring to return the obligations
under which that prelate had formerly laid him, by extolling his
abilities and virtues to the queen, and recommending him as a
worthy successor to Calonne, whom she had never trusted or liked.
In reality, the archbishop was wholly destitute of either
abilities or virtues.

He was notorious both for open profligacy and for avowed infidelity,
so much so that Louis had refused to transfer him to the diocese
of Paris, on the ground that "at least the archbishop of the
metropolis ought to believe in God.[9]" But Marie Antoinette
was ignorant of his character, and believed De Vermond's assurance
that the appointment of so high an ecclesiastic would propitiate
the clergy, whose opposition, as many of her letters prove, she
thought specially formidable, and for whose support she knew
her husband to be nervously anxious. Some of Calonne's colleagues
strongly urged the king to re-appoint Necker, whose recall
would have been highly popular with the nation. But Necker
had recently given Louis personal offense by publishing a
reply to some of Calonne's statements, in defiance of the king's
express prohibition, and had been banished from Paris for the act;
and the queen, recollecting how he had formerly refused to withdraw
his resignation at her entreaty, felt that she had no reason to
expect any great consideration for the opinions or wishes of either
herself or the king from one so conceited and self-willed, who would
be likely to attribute his re-appointment, not to the king's voluntary
choice, but to his necessities: she therefore strongly pressed that
the archbishop should be preferred.

In an unhappy moment she prevailed;[10] and on the 1st of May,
1787, Loménie de Brienne was installed in office with the title
of Chief of the Council of Finance.

A more unhappy choice could not possibly have been made. The new
minister was soon seen to be as devoid of information and ability
as he was known to be of honesty.

He had a certain gravity of outward demeanor which imposed upon
many, and he had also the address to lead the conversation
to points which, his hearers understood still less than himself;
dilating on finance and the money market even to the ladies of the
court, who had had some share in persuading the queen of his fitness
for office.[11] But his disposition was in reality as rash as that
of Calonne; and it was a curious proof of his temerity, as well as
of his ignorance of the feeling of parties in Paris, that though
he knew the Notables to be friendly to him, as indeed they would
have been to any one who might have superseded Calonne, he dismissed
them before the end of the month.

And the language held on their dissolution both by the ministers
and by the President of the Notables, and which was cheerfully
accepted by the people, is remarkable from the contrast which it
affords to the feelings which swayed the national council exactly
two years afterward.

Some measures of retrenchment which the Notables had recommended
had been adopted; some reductions had been made in the royal
households; some costly ceremonies had been abolished; and one or
two imposts, which had pressed with great severity on the poorer
classes, had been extinguished or modified.

And not only did M.

Lamoignon, the Keeper of the Seals, in the speech in which he
dismissed them, venture to affirm that these reductions would be
found to have effected all that was needed to restore universal
prosperity to the kingdom; but the President of the Assembly, in
his reply, thanked God "for having caused him to be born in such
an age, under such a government, and for having made him the subject
of a king whom he was constrained to love," and the thanksgiving
was re-echoed by the whole Assembly.

But this contentment did not last long.

The embarrassments of the Treasury were too serious to be dissipated
by soft speeches.

The Notables were hardly dissolved before the archbishop proposed
a new loan of an enormous amount; and, as he might have foreseen,
their dissolution revived the pretensions of the Parliament.
The queen's description of the rise of a French opposition at once
received a practical commentary.

The debates in the Parliament became warmer than they had ever been
since the days of the Fronde: the citizens, sharing in the excitement,
thronged the palace of the Parliament, expressing their approval
or disapproval of the different speakers by disorderly and unprecedented
clamor; the great majority hooting down the minister and his
supporters, and cheering those who spoke against him.

The Duc d'Orléans, by open bribes, gained over many of the
councilors to oppose the court in every thing. The registration
of several of the edicts which the minister had sent down was
refused; and one member of the Orleanist party even demanded the
convocation of the States- general, formerly and constitutionally
the great council of the nation, but which had never been assembled
since the time of Richelieu.

The archbishop was sometimes angry, and sometimes terrified, and
as weak in his anger as in his terror.

He persuaded the king to hold a bed of justice to compel the
registration of the edicts.

When the Parliament protested, he banished it to Troyes.

In less than a month he became alarmed at his own vigor, and recalled
it. Encouraged by his pusillanimity, and more secure than ever
of the support of the citizens who had been thrown into consternation
by his demand of a second loan, nearly[12] six times as large as
the first, it became more audacious and defiant than ever, D'Orléans
openly placing himself at the head of the malcontents.

Loménie persuaded the king to banish the duke, and to arrest one
or two of his most vehement partisans; and again in a few weeks
repented of this act of decision also, released the prisoners, and
recalled the duke.

As a matter of course, the Parliament grew bolder still.

Every measure which the minister proposed was rejected; and under
the guidance of one of their members, Duval d'Esprémesnil, the
councilors at last proceeded so far as to take the initiative in
new legislation into their own hands.

In the first week in May, 1788, they passed a series of resolutions
affirming that to be the law which indeed ought to have been so,
but which had certainly never been regarded as such at any period
of French history.

One declared that magistrates were irremovable, except in cases
of misconduct; another, that the individual liberty and property
of every citizen were inviolable; others insisted on the necessity
of convoking the States- general as the only assembly
entitled to impose taxes; and the councilors hoped to secure the
royal acceptance of these resolutions by some previous
votes which asserted that, of those laws which were the very
foundation of the Constitution, the first was that which
assured the "crown to the reigning house and to its descendants
in the male line, in the order of primogeniture.[13]"
But Louis, or rather his rash minister, was not to be so
conciliated; and a scene ensued which is the first of the striking
parallels which this period in France affords to the events which
had taken place in England a century and a half before.

As in 1642 Charles I. had attempted to arrest members of the
English Parliament in the very House of Commons, so the
archbishop now persuaded Louis to send down the captain of the
guard, the Marquis d'Agoust, to the palace of the Parliament, to
seize D'Esprémesnil, and another councilor named Montsabert, who
had been one of his foremost supporters in the recent discussions.

They behaved with admirable dignity.
Marie Antoinette was not one to betray her husband's counsels,
as Henrietta Maria had betrayed those of Charles. D'Esprémesnil
and his friend, wholly taken by surprise, had had no warning of
what was designed, no time to withdraw, nor in all probability would
they have done so in any case.

When M. d'Agoust entered the council hall and demanded his prisoners,
there was a great uproar. The whole Assembly made common cause
with their two brethren who were thus threatened. "We are all
d'Esprémesnils and Montsaberts," was their unanimous cry;
while the tumult at the doors, where a vast multitude was
collected, many of whom had arms in their hands and seemed
prepared to use them, was more formidable still.

But D'Agoust, though courteous in the discharge of his duty, was
intrepid and firm; and the two members voluntarily surrendered
themselves and retired in custody, while the archbishop was so
elated with his triumph that a few days afterwards he induced the
king to venture on another imitation of the history of England,
though now it was not Charles, but the more tyrannical Cromwell,
whose conduct was copied.

Before the end of the month the Governor of Paris entered the palace
of the Parliament, seized all the registers and documents of every
kind, locked the doors, and closed them with the king's seal; and
a royal edict was issued suspending all the parliaments both in the
capital and the provinces.

The whole kingdom was thrown into great and dangerous excitement
by these transactions.

Little as were the benefits which the people had ever derived from
the conduct of the Parliament, their opposition to the archbishop,
who had already had time to make himself generally hated and despised,
caused the councilors to be very generally regarded as champions
of liberty; and in the most distant provinces, in Béarn, in Isère,
and in Brittany, public meetings (a thing hitherto unknown in the
history of the nation) were held, remonstrances were drawn up,
confederacies were formed, and oaths were administered by which
those who took them bound themselves never to surrender what they
affirmed to be the ancient privileges of the nation.

The archbishop became alarmed; a little, perhaps, for the nation
and the king, but far more for his own place, which he had already
contrived to render profitable to himself by the preferments
which it had enabled him to engross.

And, in the hope of saving it, he now entreated Necker to join the
Government, proposing to yield up the management of the finances
to him, and to retain only the post of prime minister.

A letter from the queen to Mercy shows that she acquiesced
in the scheme.
"Here in this old monkery, Lois," he continued with a smile, "they
try to get all that self-pity and pride in our own wills out of
us right at the first. They put us to scrubbing floors--and other
things. It's like that idea of saving your life by losing it.

There was a general laugh in which Lois joined.

"An old lady who comes here to Mass sent Kieth this ice-cream,"
whispered Jarvis under cover of the laugh, "because she'd heard
you were coming. It's pretty good, isn't it?"

There were tears trembling in Lois' eyes.


IV


Then half an hour later over in the chapel things suddenly went
all wrong. It was several years since Lois had been at
Benediction and at first she was thrilled by the gleaming
monstrance with its central spot of white, the air rich and heavy
with incense, and the sun shining through the stained-glass
window of St. Francis Xavier overhead and falling in warm red
tracery on the cassock of the man in front of her, but at the
first notes of the "O SALUTARIS HOSTIA" a heavy weight seemed to
descend upon her soul. Kieth was on her right and young Jarvis on
her left, and she stole uneasy glance at both of them.

What's the matter with me? she thought impatiently.

She looked again. Was there a certain coldness in both their
profiles, that she had not noticed before--a pallor about the
mouth and a curious set expression in their eyes? She shivered
slightly: they were like dead men.

She felt her soul recede suddenly from Kieth's. This was her
brother--this, this unnatural person. She caught herself in the
act of a little laugh.

"What is the matter with me?"

She passed her hand over her eyes and the weight increased. The
incense sickened her and a stray, ragged note from one of the
tenors in the choir grated on her ear like the shriek of a
slate-pencil. She fidgeted, and raising her hand to her hair
touched her forehead, found moisture on it.

"It's hot in here, hot as the deuce."

Again she repressed a faint laugh and, then in an instant the
weight on her heart suddenly diffused into cold fear. . . . It
was that candle on the altar. It was all wrong--wrong. Why didn't
somebody see it? There was something IN it. There was something
coming out of it, taking form and shape above it.

She tried to fight down her rising panic, told herself it was the
wick. If the wick wasn't straight, candles did something--but
they didn't do this! With incalculable rapidity a force was
gathering within her, a tremendous, assimilative force, drawing
from every sense, every corner of her brain, and as it surged up
inside her she felt an enormous terrified repulsion. She drew her
arms in close to her side away from Kieth and Jarvis.

Something in that candle . . . she was leaning forward--in
another moment she felt she would go forward toward it--didn't
any one see it? . . . anyone?

"Ugh!"

She felt a space beside her and something told her that Jarvis
had gasped and sat down very suddenly . . . then she was kneeling
and as the flaming monstrance slowly left the altar in the hands
of the priest, she heard a great rushing noise in her ears--the
crash of the bells was like hammer-blows . . . and then in a
moment that seemed eternal a great torrent rolled over her
heart--there was a shouting there and a lashing as of waves . . .

. . . She was calling, felt herself calling for Kieth, her lips
mouthing the words that would not come:

"Kieth! Oh, my God! KIETH!"

Suddenly she became aware of a new presence, something external,
in front of her, consummated and expressed in warm red tracery.
Then she knew. It was the window of St. Francis Xavier. Her mind
gripped at it, clung to it finally, and she felt herself calling
again endlessly, impotently--Kieth--Kieth!

Then out of a great stillness came a voice:

"BLESSED BE GOD."

With a gradual rumble sounded the response rolling heavily
through the chapel:

"Blessed be God."

The words sang instantly in her heart; the incense lay mystically
and sweetly peaceful upon the air, and THE CANDLE ON THE ALTAR
WENT OUT.

"Blessed be His Holy Name."

"Blessed be His Holy Name."

Everything blurred into a swinging mist. With a sound half-gasp,
half-cry she rocked on her feet and reeled backward into Kieth's
suddenly outstretched arms.

"Lie still, child."

She closed her eyes again. She was on the grass outside, pillowed
on Kieth's arm, and Regan was dabbing her head with a cold towel.

"I'm all right," she said quietly.

"I know, but just lie still a minute longer. It was too hot in
there. Jarvis felt it, too."

She laughed as Regan again touched her gingerly with the towel.

"I'm all right," she repeated.

But though a warm peace was falling her mind and heart she felt
oddly broken and chastened, as if some one had held her stripped
soul up and laughed.


VI


Half an hour later she walked leaning on Kieth's arm down the
long central path toward the gate.

"It's been such a short afternoon," he sighed, "and I'm so sorry
you were sick, Lois."

"Kieth, I'm feeling fine now, really; I wish you wouldn't worry."

"Poor old child. I didn't realize that Benediction'd be a long
service for you after your hot trip out here and all."

She laughed cheerfully.

"I guess the truth is I'm not much used to Benediction. Mass is
the limit of my religious exertions."

She paused and then continued quickly:

"I don't want to shock you, Kieth, but I can't tell you how--how
INCONVENIENT being a Catholic is. --Danger and Heroism of the
Queen.--The Royal Family remove to Paris.--Their Reception at
the Barrier and at the Hôtel de Ville.--Shabbiness of the
Tuileries.--The King fixes his Residence there.

Necker had obeyed the king's summons the moment that he received
it, and before the end of the month he returned to Versailles and
resumed his office.

But, even before the king's dispatch reached him, Paris
had witnessed terrible proofs that the tranquillity which
the king's visit to the capital was supposed to have re-established
was but temporary. The populace had broken out into fresh tumults,
murdering some of Breteuil's colleagues with circumstances of
frightful barbarity; while intelligence of similar disturbances
in the provinces was constantly arriving.

In Normandy, in Alsace, and in Provence, in the towns, and in the
rural districts, the towns-people and the peasants rose against
their wealthier neighbors or their landlords, burning their houses,
and commonly murdering the owners with the most revolting barbarity.

Some were torn into pieces; some were roasted alive; some had
actually portions of their flesh cut off and eaten by their murderers
in their own sight, before the blow was given which terminated their
agonies.

Their sex did not save ladies from being victims of the same
cruelties, nor did it prevent women from being actors in them.

Yet the horror of these scenes was scarcely stranger than the
pusillanimity of those who endured them unresistingly; for there
were not wanting instances of magistrates honest enough to detest,
and courageous enough to chastise, such outrages; and wherever the
effort was made it succeeded so completely as to fix no slight
criminality on those who submitted to them.

In Dauphiny, the States of the province raised a small guard, which
quelled the first attempts to cause riots there, and hanged the
ringleaders.

In Mâcon, a similar force, though not three hundred strong, encountered
a band of brigands, six thousand in number, and brought back two
hundred prisoners, the chiefs of whom were instantly executed, and
by their prompt punishment tranquillity was restored.

Similar firmness would have saved other districts, which now allowed
themselves to be the victims of ravage and murder; as afterward it
would have preserved the whole country, even when the madness and
wickedness of subsequent years were at their height; for in no part
of the kingdom did those who perpetrated or sympathized with the
crimes which have made the Revolution a by-word, approach the number
of those who loathed them, but who had not the courage or foresight
to withstand them.

It seemed as if a long course of misgovernment, and the example
of the profligacy and impiety set by the higher classes for many
generations, had demoralized the entire people, some in their
excesses discarding the ordinary instincts of human beings; while
the bulk of the nation had lost even that courage which had once
been among its most shining qualities, and had no longer the manliness
to resist outrages which they abhorred, even when their own safety
was staked upon their repression.

And similar weakness was exhibited in the Assembly itself; for,
unquestionably, the party which at last prevailed was not that
which was originally the strongest. Like most assemblies
of the kind, it was divided into three parties--the extreme
Royalists, or "the Right;" the extreme Reformers (who were subdivided
into several sections), or "the Left;" and between them the moderate
Constitutionalists, or "the Plain," as they were called, from
occupying seats in the middle of the hall, between the raised benches
on either side.

And to the last party belonged all the men most distinguished either
for statesman-like perceptions or for eloquence, Mirabeau himself
agreeing with them in all their leading principles, though he never
formally enrolled himself in the ranks of any party.

The majority of the Constitutionalists were as loyal to the king's
person and dignity as the extreme Royalists; their most
eloquent speaker, a young lawyer named Barnave, at the first opening
of the States had even sought to open a direct communication with
the court, begging Madame de Lamballe[1] to assure the queen of the
wish of himself and all his friends to maintain the king in the
full enjoyment and exercise of what he called a Constitutional
authority, borrowing the idea and expression from the English
Government.

But though Marie Antoinette had no objection to the king of his own
accord renouncing portions of the power which had been claimed and
exerted by his predecessors, she would not hear of the States taking
upon themselves to impose such sacrifices on him, or to curtail his
authority by any exercise of their own; and she rejected with
something like disdain the support of those whose alliance was only
to be purchased on such conditions.

Barnave, like Mirabeau, felt insulted; determined to revenge
himself, and for a while united himself to the fiercest of the
Republicans; while the Right, with incredible folly, often played
into his hand, joining the Left, of which many members avowedly
aimed at the abolition of royalty, and with none of whom they had
one opinion or sentiment in common to defeat the Constitutionalists,
with whom they practically had but very slight differences.

And thus, as with a base pusillanimity, many, both of the Right and
of the Plain, fled from the country after the tumults of October,
the mastery of the Assembly gradually fell into the hands of that
party which contained by far fewer men of ability or honesty than
either of the others, but which surpassed them both in distinctness
of object, and in unscrupulous resolution to carry out its views.

But the events of July, the mutiny of the troops, the successful
insurrection of the mob, the destruction of the Bastile, and the
visit of Louis to Paris, had been a series of damaging blows to the
Government; and as each successive exploit gave encouragement to
the movement party, events proceeded with extreme rapidity.

Necker, who returned to Versailles on the 27th of July, showed
more clearly than ever his unfitness for the chief post in the
administration at such a crisis, by devoting himself solely to
financial arrangements, and omitting to take, on the part of the
crown, the initiative in any one of the reforms which the king had
promised.

Those he permitted to be intrusted to a committee of the Assembly;
and the committee had scarcely met when the Assembly took the
matter into its own hands; and in a strange panic, and at a single
sitting, swept away the privileges of both Nobles and clergy, those
who seemed personally most concerned in their maintenance being the
foremost in urging their suppression.

A member of the oldest nobility proposed the abolition of the
privileges of the Nobles.

A bishop moved the extinction of tithes; Bretons, Burgundians,
Provençals, renounced for their fellow- citizens the old distinctions
and immunities to which each province had hitherto clung with an
unyielding if somewhat unreasoning attachment; and the whole was
crowned by the Archbishop of Paris proposing a celebration of the
_Te Deum_, as an expression of gratitude to God for having inspired
a series of actions calculated to confer so much happiness on the
nation.

Though he could not avoid seeing the mischievous character
of many of the resolutions thus tumultuously passed, and though
his royal assent to them was asked in language unceremonious and
almost peremptory in its curtness, Louis could not bring himself,
or perhaps did not venture, to refuse his sanction to them.

He had laid down a rule for himself to refuse no concession except
such as on religious grounds his conscience might revolt
from; and on the 18th he signified his formal acceptance of the
resolutions, and of the title of "Restorer of French Liberty."

It was an act of great weakness, and was rewarded, as such acts
generally are, by further encroachments on his authority.

The progress of the Left was not even arrested by a quarrel between
some of its members (who, being clergymen, were not inclined to
be reduced to beggary by the extinction of their incomes),
and Mirabeau, who, not unnaturally, bore the priests especial
ill-will. Before the end of the month, the Assembly even
deprived the king of the power of withholding his assent from
measures which it might pass, enacting that he should no longer
possess an absolute "veto," as it was called, and Necker,
exhibiting on this question an incapacity more glaring than even
his former conduct had displayed, induced the king to yield this
point also; and to express his own preference for what its contrivers
called a suspensive veto--a power, that is, of withholding his
assent to any measure till it had been passed by two successive
Assemblies.

The discussions on this most momentous point had been very vehement
in the Assembly itself; and, besides the greatness of the principle
involved in the decision, they have a peculiar importance as showing
that Mirabeau had not the absolute power over the minds of the
members which he believed himself to possess; since he contended
with all the energy of his temper, and with irresistible force of
argument, against a vote which, as he declared, could only take the
power from the king to vest it in the Assembly, and yet was wholly
unable to carry more than a small minority with him in his
opposition.

And this defeat may have had some share in prompting him to
countenance and aid, if indeed he was not the original contriver
of, a plot which was undoubtedly intended to produce a change
in the whole frame-work of the Government. The harvest had
been bad, and at the beginning of September Paris was suffering
under a scarcity almost as severe as had ever been felt in the
depth of winter. The emergency was so great that the king sent
all his plate to the Mint to be melted down, to procure money to
purchase food for the starving citizens; and many patriotic
individuals, Necker himself being among the most munificent, gave
their plate and jewels for the same benevolent object.

But relief procured from such sources was unavoidably of too limited
a character to last long.

Though Necker proposed and the Assembly voted taxes of prodigious
amount, they could not at once be made available, and some of
the lower classes were said to have died of actual famine.

In their distress the citizens looked to the king, and attributed
their misery in a great degree to his ignorance of their situation,
which was caused by his living at Versailles.

They nicknamed him the "Baker," as if he could supply them with
bread, and began to clamor for him at least to take up an occasional
residence among them in in his capital.

From raising a cry, the step was easy to organize a riot to compel
him to do so.

And to this object the partisans of the Duke of Orleans,
assisted, if not prompted, by Mirabeau, now began to apply themselves,
hoping that the result would be the deposition of Louis and the
enthronement of the duke, who might be glad to take the great orator
for his prime minister.

So certain did the conspirators feel of success, that they took no
pains to keep their machinations secret.

As early as the middle of September intelligence was received
at Versailles that the Parisians would march upon that town in
force, on the 5th of October; and the Assembly was greatly alarmed,
believing, not without reason, that the object of the intended
attack was to overawe and overbear them.

The magistrates of the town were even more terrified, and
besought the king to bring up at least one regiment for their
protection.

And, prudent and reasonable as the request was, the compliance with
it furnished the agents of sedition with pretexts for further
violence.

A regiment, known as that of Flanders, was sent for from the
frontiers, and speedily arrived at Versailles, when, according to
their old and hospitable fashion, the Body-guard,[2] who regarded
Versailles as their home, invited the officers, and with them the
officers of the Swiss Guard, and those of the town militia also,
to a banquet on the 1st of October.

The opera-house, as had often been done in similar instances, was
lent for the occasion; and the boxes were filled with the chief
ladies of the court and of the town, and also with many members of
the Assembly, as spectators.

So enthusiastic were the acclamations that greeted the toast of
the king's health, that, though Marie Antoinette had previously
desired that the royal family should not appear to have any connection
with the entertainment, the captain of the guard, the Count de
Luxembourg, had no difficulty in persuading her that it would but
be a graceful recognition of such spontaneous and sincere loyalty
at such a time if she were to honor the banquet with her presence,
though but by the briefest visit.

Louis, too, accepted the proposal with greater warmth than usual,
and when the royal pair with their children--the queen, as was her
custom, leading one in each hand--descended from their apartments
and walked through the banquet-hall, the enthusiasm was redoubled.

The spectators, among whom were many members of the Assembly, caught
the contagion.

Loyal cheers resounded from every part of the theatre, and the
feelings excited became so fervid that some officers of the National
Guard, who were among the guests, reversed their new tricolor
cockade, and, displaying the white side outermost, seemed to have
resumed the time-honored badge under which the army had reaped all
its old glories.

The band struck up a favorite air from one of the new operas,
"Peut-on affliger ce qu'on aime?" which those who saw the anxiety
which recent events had already stamped upon the queen's majestic
brow could hardly avoid applying to their royal mistress; and when
it followed it up by Blondel's lamentation for Richard, "O Richard,
O mon roi, l'univers t'abandonne," the first notes of the well-known
song touched a chord in every heart, and the whole company, courtiers,
ladies, soldiers, and deputies, were all carried away in a perfect
delirium of loyal rapture.

The whole company escorted the royal family back to their apartments;
though it was remarked afterward that some of the soldiers, who on
this occasion were the most vociferous in their exultation, were,
before the end of the same week, among the most furious threateners
and assailants of the palace.

But a demonstration such as this, in which the whole number of
the soldiers concerned did not exceed fifteen hundred men, could
not deter the organizers of the impending riot from carrying out
their plan: if it did not even aid them by the opportunities which
it afforded for spreading abroad exaggerated accounts of what had
taken place, as an additional proof of the settled hatred and
contempt which the court entertained for the people.

Mirabeau had suggested that the best chance of success for an
insurrection in Paris lay in placing women at its head; and, in
compliance with his hint, at day-break on the appointed morning a
woman of notorious infamy of character moved toward the chief
market-place of Paris, beating a drum, and calling on all who heard
her to follow her.[3] She soon gathered round her a troop of followers
worthy of such a leader, market- women, fish-women, and men in
women's clothes, whose deep voices, and the power with which they
brandished their weapons, betrayed their sex through their disguise.

                                                      One man, Maillard, who had been conspicuous as one of the fiercest
of the stormers of the Bastile, disdained any concealment or dress
but his own; they chose him for their leader, mingling with their
cries for bread horrid threats against the queen and the aristocrats.

Their numbers increased till they felt themselves strong enough to
attack the Hôtel de Ville.

A detachment of the National Guard who were on duty offered them
no resistance, pleading that they had received no orders from La
Fayette; and the rioters, now amounting to many thousands, having
armed themselves from the store of muskets and swords which they
found in the armory, passed on to the barrier and took the road to
Versailles.

The riot had lasted four hours, and the very last of the rioters
had already passed through the gates before La Fayette reached
the Hôtel de Ville, though his office of Commander of the
National Guard made the preservation of tranquillity one
of his most especial duties. He had evidently feared to risk
his popularity by resisting the mob, and even now he refused
to act at all till be had received a written order from
the Municipal Council; and, when he had obtained that, he
did not obey it; but preferred complying with the demands of his
own soldiers, who insisted on following the rioters to Versailles,
where they would exterminate the regiment of Flanders; bring the
king back to Paris; and perhaps depose him and appoint a Regent.

Yet even this open avowal of their treasonable
views did not deter their unworthy general from submitting to their
dictates.

He had indeed no desire for the success of their designs; for he
had no connection with the Duc d'Orléans, and no inclination to
co-operate with Mirabeau, who he knew was in the habit of speaking
of him with contempt; but he had not firmness to resist their demand.

His vanity, too, always his most predominant feeling, was
flattered by the desire they expressed to retain him as their
commander, and at last he procured from the magistrates a fresh
order, authorizing him to comply with the soldiers' clamor,
and to lead them to Versailles.

When before the magistrates he had professed an expectation
that he should be able to induce the king to comply with the
wishes of the Assembly, and a determination to restrain the
excesses of the mob; but the whole day had been so
wasted by his irresolution that when he at last put his regiment
in motion it was seven o'clock in the evening--full four hours
after Maillard and his fish-women had reached Versailles. The
news of their approach and of their designs had been brought to
the palace by Monsieur de Chinon, the eldest son of the Duc de
Richelieu, who, at great personal risk, had disguised himself as
an artisan, and had marched some way with the crowd to learn their
object.

He reported that even the women and children were armed, that
the great majority were drunk; that they were beguiling the
way with the most ferocious threats, and that they had been
joined by a gang of men who gave themselves the name of
"Coupe-têtes," and boasted that they should have ample opportunity
of proving their title to it.

In addition to the warnings previously received, a rumor had
reached the palace on the preceding evening that the Duc d'Orléans
had come down to Versailles in disguise,[4] a movement which
could hardly have an innocent object; but so little heed had
been given to the intelligence, or, it may perhaps be said, so
little was it supposed that, if such an attack was really meditated,
any warning would have been given, that Monsieur de Chinon found
the palace empty.

Louis had gone to hunt in the Bois de Meudon; Marie Antoinette
was at the Little Trianon. But messengers easily found them. The
queen came in with speed from her garden, which she was destined
never to behold again; the king hastened hack from his coverts;
and by the time that they returned, the Count de St. Priest,
the Minister of the Household, had their carriages ready for
them to retire to Rambouillet, and he earnestly pressed the
adoption of such a course.
Louis, as usual, could not make up his mind. He sat in his chair,
repeating that it was a moment to think seriously.

"Rather," said Marie Antoinette, "say that it is a time to act
promptly." He would gladly have had her depart with her children,
but she refused to leave him, declaring that her place was
by his side; that, as the daughter of Maria Teresa, she did not
fear death; and after a time he changed his mind and ceased to wish
even her to retire, clinging to his old conviction that conciliation
was always possible.

He believed that he had won over even the worst of the mob, and
that all danger was past.

Versailles witnessed a strange scene that morning. The moment that
the mob reached the town, they forced their way into the Assembly
Hall, where Maillard, as their spokesman, after terrifying the
members with ferocious threats against the whole body of the Nobles,
demanded that the Assembly should send a deputation to the king to
represent to him the distress of the people, and that a party of
the women should accompany it.

Louis consented to receive them, and when they reached the palace,
the women, disorderly and ferocious as they were, were so awed by
the magnificence and pomp which they beheld, and by the actual
presence of the king and queen, that they could only summon up a
few modest and humble words of petition, and one, a young and pretty
girl of seventeen, fainted with the excitement.

One of the princesses brought her a glass of water: she recovered,
and, as she knelt to kiss the king's hand, Louis kissed her himself,
and, transported by his affability, she and her companions quit the
apartment, uttering loud cheers for the king and queen.

But this had not been the impression which their leaders had
intended them to receive; and, when they reached the streets,
their new-born loyalty so exasperated their comrades that the
soldiers had some difficulty in saving them from their fury.

Meanwhile, the mob increased every hour.

They occupied the court-yard of the palace, roaring out ferocious
threats, the most sanguinary of which were directed against
the queen. The President of the Assembly moved that the members
should adjourn and repair to the palace for the protection of the
royal family, but Mirabeau resisted the proposal, and procured its
rejection; and when a large party of the members went, as individuals,
to place their services at the king's disposal, he mingled with the
rioters, tampering with the soldiers, and urging them to espouse
what he called the cause of the people.

As it grew dark, the crowd grew more and more tumultuous and violent.

The Body-guard, who were all gentlemen, were faithful and
fearless; but it began to be seen that none of the other troops,
not even the regiment of Flanders, could be trusted.

Some of them even fired on the Body-guard, and mortally wounded its
commander, the Marquis de Savonières; while Louis, adhering to his
unhappy policy of conciliation even at such a moment, sent down
orders to the officer who succeeded to the command that the men
were not to use their weapons, and that all bloodshed was to be
avoided.

"Tell the king," replied M.
d'Huillier, "that his orders shall be obeyed; but that we shall
all be assassinated."
The mob grew fiercer when it became known that La Fayette and his
regiment were approaching. No one knew what course he might take,
but the ringleaders of the rioters resolved on a strenuous
effort to render his arrival useless by their previous success.

Guns were fired, heavy blows were dealt on the railings of the
inner court-yard and on the gates; and the danger seemed
so imminent that the mob might force its way into the palace, that
the deputies themselves besought the king to delay no longer, but
to retire to Rambouillet.

He was still irresolute, and still trusting to his plan of
conciliating by non-resistance.

The queen, though more earnest than ever that he should depart,
still nobly adhered to her own view of duty, and refused to leave
him; but, hoping that he might change his mind, she gave a written
order to keep the carriages harnessed, and to prepare to force a
passage for them if the life of the king should appear to be in
danger; but, she added, they were not to be used if she alone were
threatened.

At last, when it was nearly midnight, La Fayette arrived.

With a singular perverseness of folly, at a time when every moment
was of consequence, he had halted his men a mile out of the town
to make them a speech in praise of himself and his own loyalty, and
to administer to them an oath to be faithful to the nation, to the
law, and to the king; an oath needless if they were inclined to
keep it; useless, if they were not; and in the state of feeling
then common, mischievous in the order in which he ranged the powers
to which he required them to profess allegiance.

At last he reached the palace. Leaving his men below, he ascended
to the king's apartments, and, laying his hand on his heart, assured
the king that he had no more loyal servant than himself.

Louis was not given to sarcasm: yet some of the bystanders fancied
that there was a tone of irony in his voice when in reply he expressed
his conviction of the marquis's sincerity; and perhaps La Fayette
thought so too, for he proceeded to harangue his majesty on his
favorite subject of his own courage; describing the dangers which,
as he affirmed, he had incurred in the course of the day.

Other men who broke the laws of justice and charity lied to all
the world. He at any rate would not lie to himself. He was more
than Byronic now: not the spiritual rebel, Don Juan; not the
philosophical rebel, Faust; but a new psychological rebel of his
own century--defying the sentimental a priori forms of his own
mind---

Happiness was what he wanted--a slowly rising scale of
gratifications of the normal appetites--and he had a strong
conviction that the materials, if not the inspiration of
happiness, could be bought with money.

The night came that drew him out upon his second venture, and
as he walked the dark street he felt in himself a great
resemblance to a cat--a certain supple, swinging litheness. His
muscles were rippling smoothly and sleekly under his spare,
healthy flesh--he had an absurd desire to bound along the
street, to run dodging among trees, to tarn "cart-wheels" over
soft grass.

It was not crisp, but in the air lay a faint suggestion of
acerbity, inspirational rather than chilling.

"The moon is down--I have not heard the clock!"

He laughed in delight at the line which an early memory had
endowed with a hushed awesome beauty.

He passed a man and then another a quarter of mile afterward.

He was on Philmore Street now and it was very dark. He blessed
the city council for not having put in new lamp-posts as a
recent budget had recommended. Here was the red-brick Sterner
residence which marked the beginning of the avenue; here was the
Jordon house, the Eisenhaurs', the Dents', the Markhams', the
Frasers'; the Hawkins', where he had been a guest; the
Willoughbys', the Everett's, colonial and ornate; the little
cottage where lived the Watts old maids between the imposing
fronts of the Macys' and the Krupstadts'; the Craigs--

Ah . . . THERE! He paused, wavered violently--far up the street
was a blot, a man walking, possibly a policeman. After an
eternal second be found himself following the vague, ragged
shadow of a lamp-post across a lawn, running bent very low.
Then he was standing tense, without breath or need of it, in the
shadow of his limestone prey.

Interminably he listened--a mile off a cat howled, a hundred
yards away another took up the hymn in a demoniacal snarl, and
he felt his heart dip and swoop, acting as shock-absorber for
his mind. There were other sounds; the faintest fragment of song
far away; strident, gossiping laughter from a back porch
diagonally across the alley; and crickets, crickets singing in
the patched, patterned, moonlit grass of the yard. Within the
house there seemed to lie an ominous silence. He was glad he did
not know who lived here.

His slight shiver hardened to steel; the steel softened and his
nerves became pliable as leather; gripping his hands he
gratefully found them supple, and taking out knife and pliers he
went to work on the screen.

So sure was he that he was unobserved that, from the dining-room
where in a minute he found himself, he leaned out and carefully
pulled the screen up into position, balancing it so it would
neither fall by chance nor be a serious obstacle to a sudden
exit.

Then he put the open knife in his coat pocket, took out his
pocket-flash, and tiptoed around the room.

There was nothing here he could use--the dining-room had never
been included in his plans for the town was too small to permit
disposing of silver.

As a matter of fact his plans were of the vaguest. He had found
that with a mind like his, lucrative in intelligence, intuition,
and lightning decision, it was best to have but the skeleton of
a campaign. The machine-gun episode had taught him that. And he
was afraid that a method preconceived would give him two points
of view in a crisis--and two points of view meant wavering.

He stumbled slightly on a chair, held his breath, listened, went
on, found the hall, found the stairs, started up; the seventh
stair creaked at his step, the ninth, the fourteenth. He was
counting them automatically. At the third creak he paused again
for over a minute--and in that minute he felt more alone than he
had ever felt before. Between the lines on patrol, even when
alone, he had had behind him the moral support of half a billion
people; now he was alone, pitted against that same moral
pressure--a bandit. He had never felt this fear, yet he had
never felt this exultation.

The stairs came to an end, a doorway approached; he went in and
listened to regular breathing. His feet were economical of steps
and his body swayed sometimes at stretching as he felt over the
bureau, pocketing all articles which held promise--he could not
have enumerated them ten seconds afterward. He felt on a chair
for possible trousers, found soft garments, women's lingerie.
The corners of his mouth smiled mechanically.

Another room . . . the same breathing, enlivened by one ghastly
snort that sent his heart again on its tour of his breast. Round
object--watch; chain; roll of bills; stick-pins; two rings--he
remembered that he had got rings from the other bureau. He
started out winced as a faint glow flashed in front of him,
facing him. God!--it was the glow of his own wrist-watch on his
outstretched arm.

Down the stairs. He skipped two crumbing steps but found
another. He was all right now, practically safe; as he neared
the bottom he felt a slight boredom. He reached the dining-room
--considered the silver--again decided against it.

Back in his room at the boarding-house he examined the additions
to his personal property:

Sixty-five dollars in bills.

A platinum ring with three medium diamonds, worth, probably,
about seven hundred dollars. Diamonds were going up.

A cheap gold-plated ring with the initials O. S. and the date
inside--'03--probably a class-ring from school. Worth a few
dollars. Unsalable.

A red-cloth case containing a set of false teeth.

A silver watch.

A gold chain worth more than the watch.

An empty ring-box.

A little ivory Chinese god--probably a desk ornament.

A dollar and sixty-two cents an small change.

He put the money under his pillow and the other things in the
toe of an infantry boot, stuffing a stocking in on top of them.
Then for two hours his mind raced like a high-power engine here
and there through his life, past and future, through fear and
laughter. With a vague, inopportune wish that he were married,
he fell into a deep sleep about half past five.


VI


Though the newspaper account of the burglary failed to mention
the false teeth, they worried him considerably.  The picture of
a human waking in the cool dawn and groping for them in vain,
of a soft, toothless breakfast, of a strange, hollow, lisping
voice calling the police station, of weary, dispirited visits
to the dentist, roused a great fatherly pity in him.

Trying to ascertain whether they belonged to a man or a woman,
he took them carefully out of the case and held them up near
his mouth. He moved his own jaws experimentally; he measured
with his fingers; but he failed to decide: they might belong
either to a large-mouthed woman or a small-mouthed man.

On a warm impulse he wrapped them in brown paper from the
bottom of his army trunk, and printed FALSE TEETH on the
package in clumsy pencil letters. Then, the next night, he
walked down Philmore Street, and shied the package onto the
lawn so that it would be near the door. Next day the paper
announced that the police had a clew--they knew that the
burglar was in town. However, they didn't mention what the
clew was.

At the end of a month "Burglar Bill of the Silver District
was the nurse-girl's standby for frightening children. Five
burglaries were attributed to him, but though Dalyrimple had
only committed three, he considered that majority had it and
appropriated the title to himself. He had once been seen--"a
large bloated creature with the meanest face you ever laid eyes
on." Mrs. Henry Coleman, awaking at two o'clock at the beam of
an electric torch flashed in her eye, could not have been
expected to recognize Bryan Dalyrimple at whom she had waved
flags last Fourth of July, and whom she had described as "not
at all the daredevil type, do you think?"

Of all the Jacobin for party, one of the most blood-thirsty was a
wretch named Marat.[7] At the very outset of the Revolution he
had established a newspaper having betrayed the royal
authority by unworthy accessions. But, though, in the
division which had taken place they had been supported by whom
he found himself compelled to replace them had still had
hardly returned to St. Cloud, when a man named Rotondo was
apprehended in the inner garden, who confessed that he had made
his way into it with the express design of assassinating Marie
Antoinette, a design which was only balked by the fortunate accident
of a heavy shower which prevented her from leaving the house; and
a, week or two afterward a second plot was discovered, the contrivers
of which designed to poison her.

Her. attendants were greatly alarmed; and her physician furnished
Madame Campan with an antidote for such poisons as seemed
most likely to be employed. But Marie Antoinette herself cared
little for such precautions. Assassination was not the end which
she bring him within reach of the king. It was the king whom he
really wanted to strike; and he saw that the individual
safety of one of the royal confidence is indispensable to
national credit of the to remain where Providence has placed me,
and to oppose my body, if the necessity should arise, to the
knives code of the assassins who would fain reach the king. I

children.[6]" We have seen that Marie Antoinette dreaded calumny

In the denunciations of Marat he had not been spared imperil

he exhibited strange forgetfulness, not only of the respect due
to his royal master as king, but also of all the one ordinary rules
of propriety; for he did not resign his office into the hands of

communication with the court, sometimes by notes and elaborate
memorials, addressed indeed to Louis, but intended for Marie
Antoinette's and consideration; and sometimes by conversations with
La Marck, which the count was expected to repeat to her.

But, in all the counsels thus given,, in spite of his acceptance
of the Constitution, he was meditating a counter- revolution.

have denounced with great severity the conduct of Louis in thus
appealing to foreign aid, as a proof that any other advisers, we
may probably attribute the origination of the idea to the queen,
who was naturally inclined to watching the course of events in
France with interest.[4] When she wept, she wept by herself.

Her one comfort was that her children were always with her; and

.
For the next week Samuel was in a nervous turmoil. Some
persistently rational strain warned him that at bottom he and
Marjorie had little in common, but in such cases there is
usually so much mud in the water that one can seldom see to the
bottom. Every dream and desire told him that he loved Marjorie,
wanted her, had to have her.

The quarrel developed. Marjorie's husband took to staying in New
York until late at night came home several times disagreeably
overstimulated, and made her generally miserable. They must have
had too much pride to talk it out--for Marjorie's husband was,
after all, pretty decent--so it drifted on from one
misunderstanding to another. Marjorie kept coming more and more
to Samuel; when a woman can accept masculine sympathy at is much
more satisfactory to her than crying to another girl. But
Marjorie didn't realize how much she had begun to rely on him,
how much he was part of her little cosmos.

One night, instead of turning away when Marjorie went in and lit
the gas, Samuel went in, too, and they sat together on the sofa
in the little parlor. He was very happy. He envied their home,
and he felt that the man who neglected such a possession out of
stubborn pride was a fool and unworthy of his wife. But when he
kissed Marjorie for the first time she cried softly and told him
to go. He sailed home on the wings of desperate excitement,
quite resolved to fan this spark of romance, no matter how big
the blaze or who was burned. At the time he considered that his
thoughts were unselfishly of her; in a later perspective he knew
that she had meant no more than the white screen in a motion
picture: it was just Samuel--blind, desirous.

Next day at Taine's, when they met for lunch, Samuel dropped all
pretense and made frank love to her. He had no plans, no
definite intentions, except to kiss her lips again, to hold her
in his arms and feel that she was very little and pathetic and
lovable. . . . He took her home, and this time they kissed until
both their hearts beat high--words and phrases formed on his lips.

And then suddenly there were steps on the porch--a hand tried
the outside door. Marjorie turned dead-white.

"Wait!" she whispered to Samuel, in a frightened voice, but in
angry impatience at the interruption he walked to the front door
and threw it open.

Every one has seen such scenes on the stage--seen them so often
that when they actually happen people behave very much like
actors. Samuel felt that he was playing a part and the lines
came quite naturally: he announced that all had a right to lead
their own lives and looked at Marjorie's husband menacingly, as
if daring him to doubt it. Marjorie's husband spoke of the
sanctity of the home, forgetting that it hadn't seemed very holy
to him lately; Samuel continued along the line of "the right to
happiness"; Marjorie's husband mentioned firearms and the
divorce court. Then suddenly he stopped and scrutinized both of
them--Marjorie in pitiful collapse on the sofa, Samuel
haranguing the furniture in a consciously heroic pose.

"Go up-stairs, Marjorie," he said, in a different tone.

"Stay where you are!" Samuel countered quickly.

Marjorie rose, wavered, and sat down, rose again and moved
hesitatingly toward the stairs.

"Come outside," said her husband to Samuel. "I want to talk to
you."

Samuel glanced at Marjorie, tried to get some message from her
eyes; then he shut his lips and went out.

There was a bright moon and when Marjorie's husband came down
the steps Samuel could see plainly that he was suffering--but
he felt no pity for him.

They stood and looked at each other, a few feet apart, and the
husband cleared his throat as though it were a bit husky.

It was a big deal in oil which concerned the buying up of
seventeen huge adjoining ranches. This buying up had to be done
in one week, and it was a pure squeeze. Forces had been set in
motion that put the seventeen owners between the devil and the
deep sea, and Samuel's part was simply to "handle" the matter
from a little village near Pueblo. With tact and efficiency the
right man could bring it off without any friction, for it was
merely a question of sitting at the wheel and keeping a firm
hold. Hamil, with an astuteness many times valuable to his
chief, had arranged a situation that would give a much greater
clear gain than any dealing in the open market. Samuel shook
hands with Hamil, arranged to return in two weeks, and left for
San Felipe, New Mexico.

"But I suppose it's got to go
when they want it--it's got to go."

Samuel had to talk. He felt that in a minute more he would lose
his head. So he began, as level-voiced as he could--in the sort
of tone he saved for disagreeable duties.

"It's business, Mr. McIntyre," he said. "It's inside the law.
Perhaps we couldn't have bought out two or three of you at any
price, but most of you did have a price. Progress demands some
things---"

Never had he felt so inadequate, and it was with the greatest
relief that he heard hoof-beats a few hundred yards away.

But at his words the grief in McIntyre's eyes had changed to fury.

"You and your dirty gang of crooks!" be cried. "Not one of you
has got an honest love for anything on God's earth! You're a
herd of money-swine!"

Samuel rose and McIntyre took a step toward him.

"You long-winded dude. You got our land--take that for Peter
Carhart!"

He swung from the shoulder quick as lightning and down went
Samuel in a heap. Dimly he heard steps in the doorway and knew
that some one was holding McIntyre, but there was no need. The
rancher had sunk down in his chair, and dropped his head in his
hands.

Samuel's brain was whirring. He realized that the fourth fist
had hit him, and a great flood of emotion cried out that the law
that had inexorably ruled his life was in motion again. In a
half-daze he got up and strode from the room.

The second was from New York:

"Deal off come to New York immediately Carhart."

Within a week things had happened. Hamil quarrelled furiously
and violently defended his scheme. He was summoned to New York
and spent a bad half-hour on the carpet in Peter Carhart's
office. The President has the right to send messages to
Congress from time. He to during his exert some direct in
influence upon runs with legislation, and are important in

The recommendations contained in these messages opinion outside

And then the royal family, quitting the Hotel, drove to
the Tuileries, where their attendants had been hastily making
such preparations as a few hours allowed for their reception.

Since the completion of the Palace at Versailles the Tuileries
had been almost deserted.[10] The paint and gilding were
tarnished, the curtains were faded, many most necessary
articles of furniture were altogether wanting; and the whole was
so shabby that it attracted the notice of even the little dauphin.

"How bad, mamma," said he, "every thing looks here." "My boy,"
she replied, "Louis XIV. lived here comfortably enough." But
they had not yet decided on making it their permanent residence.
