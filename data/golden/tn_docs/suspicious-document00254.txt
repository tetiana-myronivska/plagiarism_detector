"Yes. Angelo has taken a villa at Cap Martin for the season. Perhaps
you've seen it. He and my new sister-in-law went to Ireland to visit
relatives of my mother, and to England afterward. They've been married
more than two months; but I saw my sister-in-law for the first time on
New Year's eve, the day they arrived. She's English, though she has
lived mostly in southern Germany, I believe. She's an artist--does
portraits beautifully, I hear, and was much admired in Rome, where she
had come to paint, when my brother met her. I know very little of her
except that she's pretty and charming--if any woman who is not _you_ can
be either. I'm sorry for all the men in the world, poor wretches,
because there's only one you, and I've got you for mine, and I shall let
them see as little of you as possible."

"That really _is_ old-fashioned!" Mary laughed.

"Do you mind? Do you want to see them?"

"Not particularly. Because you have begun to make me feel the others
aren't worth seeing."

"Angel!"

They both laughed, and Vanno was entranced when her heel slipped on a
stone, and he could clasp her so tightly as to feel the yielding of her
body against his arm. He would have liked to sing, the night was so
wonderful, and all nature seemed to be singing. Distant bells chimed,
silver sweet; frogs in hidden garden pools harped like bands of fairy
musicians; and from everywhere came the whisper and gurgle of running
water: springs from the mountains, pouring through underground canals to
houses of peasants, who bought water rights by the hour.

As the two walked down the many windings of the mule path they met
labourers coming up from the day's work in the country of the rich, far
below. Some of the young men, clattering along in groups, joined in
singing the strange tuneless songs, memories of Saracen days, which
Vanno had heard on his first mountain walk. The old men did not sing.
They climbed stolidly, with heads and shoulders bent, yet not as if
discouraged by the thought of the long, steep way before them before
they could rest at home. They had the air of taking life as it was,
entirely for granted.

The darkness was bleached with a sheen of stars, and the pulsing beams
that shot across the sky from the lighthouses of Cap Ferrat and Antibes.
Here and there, too, an electric lamp dangled from a wire over the mule
path, and revealed a flash of white teeth in a dark face or struck a
glint from a pair of deep Italian eyes. But they were the eyes and the
teeth of young men, or of girls climbing with baskets of washing on
their heads. The old men looked down, watching their own footsteps; and
their stooping figures were vague and shadowy as ships that pass in the
night, not to be recognized if seen again by daylight. Now and then a
little old woman stumbled up the path, driving a donkey which tripped
daintily along in silent primness, under a load of fresh-cut olive
branches. The sound of the tiny feet on the stones and the swish of
olive leaves against the wall added to the poetry of the night for
Vanno, though he reflected that it was all commonplace enough to the
donkeys and the women, who were as important as he in the scheme of
things. After all, it was but a question of thinking!

Boys coming up from some late errand, played at being soldiers, and
sprang out at each other from behind jutting corners of rock, imitating
the firing of guns, or uttering explosive cries.

Vanno felt a great kindness for all the world, and especially for these
people who--almost all of them--had the blood of Italy in their veins.
He remembered the curé's saying with a smile that even now, if all
Italians were banished from the French coast between Cannes and Mentone,
the Riviera would be emptied of more than half its inhabitants; and it
gave him a warm feeling in his heart to be surrounded by people of his
own blood, at this moment of his great happiness. He would have liked to
give these men something to make them happy also, for he knew that they
were poor, and that those who were most fortunate were those who worked
hardest. Each shadowy figure, as it passed on its way up the mountain,
gave out a faint odour, not disagreeable or dirty, but slightly pungent,
and like the smell of iron filings: what Tolstoi called "the good smell
of peasants."

The fire which had enveloped all Monte Carlo at sunset had burnt out
long ago, but in the west a faint red-brown glow smouldered, as if a
smoky torch had been trailed along the horizon. Monte Carlo and the Rock
of Monaco rose out of the steel-bright sea like one immense jewel-box,
or a huge purple velvet pincushion, stuck full of diamond and topaz
headed pins, with here and there a ruby or an emerald. These lights,
reflected in the water, trailed down into mysterious depths, like
illuminated roots of magic flowers; and the bright shimmer spreading out
over the moving ripples lay on the surface like glittering chain-armour.

Although they had the blaze of these amazing jewels always before their
eyes, somehow in talking Mary and Vanno contrived to lose the way,
descending to the high road nearer Cap Martin than Monte Carlo. It was
six o'clock, and a long tramp home along the level, in the dust thrown
up by motors and the trotting hoofs of horses, but in the distance a
tram car coming from Mentone sent out a shower of electric sparks, like
fireflies crushed to death between iron wheels and iron track. As the
car advanced, Vanno stepped out into the road and hailed it. No _arrêt_
was near, but the driver stopped, with an obliging, French-Italian
smile, and the two young people almost hurled themselves into empty
seats at the first-class end of the tram.

Faces which had been inclined to frown at the illegal delay, even of six
seconds, smoothed into good nature at sight of the handsome couple.
Every one at once took it for granted that they were lovers. Mary's
hair, ruffled by the hasty putting on of her hat, without a mirror, told
the story of a stolen kiss to German eyes swimming with sentiment and
romance--eyes which to an unappreciative world appeared incapable of
either. Most of the eyes in this first-class compartment were German
eyes, and some of the faces out of which they looked were round and
uninteresting; but not all. German was the language being loudly talked
across the car, from one seat to another; and a German mandate had
caused all the windows and ventilators to be shut, in fear of that fatal
thing, "a draught." English people sitting stiffly in corners, boiling
with the desire to protest yet too reserved and proud to "risk a row,"
raged internally with the belief that their German neighbours were
coarse, food-loving, pushing, selfish creatures who cared nothing for
the beauty of the Riviera, and came only because of the cheap round
trip, and the hope of winning a few five-franc pieces. The real truth
was very different. The "pushing creatures" were selfish only because
they were not self-conscious. They were as perfectly happy as children.
They raved loudly in ecstasy over the beauty of everything, and were
blissfully ignorant that it was possible for any one to despise or hate
them. Frankly they admired Vanno and Mary, staring in the unblinking,
unashamed, beaming way that children have of regarding what interests
them; and their kind, unsnobbish hearts went out to the young couple as
no English hearts in the car went out.

Two persons sitting together at the other end, but on the same side as
the newcomers, could not see what the pair were like, without bending
forward and stretching out their necks. One of these, fired by the
intense interest displayed on German faces, could not resist the
temptation to be curious. She peered round the corner of a large,
well-filled overcoat from Berlin, and saw Mary and Vanno smiling at each
other, as oblivious of all observers as though they had the tram to
themselves.

"You must take a peep, St. George," she said in her husband's ear, that
she might be heard over the noise of the tram, without roaring. "It's
that beautiful Miss Grant I told you about; and she's with the Roman
Prince who invented the parachute Rongier used in the Nice 'flying
week.' They are certainly in love with each other! They couldn't look as
they do if they weren't. Perhaps they're engaged. Poor Dick! All his
trouble for nothing."

"Why poor Dick?" inquired the Reverend George Winter.

"Oh, my dear Saint, don't put on your long-distance manner, and forget
everything that hasn't a direct connection with heaven. But these two
quite look as if they'd just been up there by special aeroplane. Don't
you remember my telling you, Dick's awfully in love with this girl, and
took me to see her again yesterday, though she never returned my first
call? But I was glad I went, because she was really sweet and charming,
and I hated to think of her living in that deadly villa."

"Yes, I remember distinctly," said Winter, with a twinkle of humour in
the eyes which seemed always to see things that no one else could see.
"You told me when I was in the midst of writing a sermon, and had got to
a particularly knotty point; so I tangled Dick and his love affairs into
the knot, while trying to put them out of my mind. I'm afraid they
didn't do my sermon much good. And beautiful as Miss Grant may be, I
won't dislocate my neck to look at her in a tram. I advise you not to do
so, either. Set our German friends a good example."

"Why is it the best of people always advise you not to do all the things
you want to do, and vice versa?" observed Rose, pleased with her success
in catching Mary's eye. They bowed to each other, smiling warmly. Vanno
took off his hat, and Rose thought him exactly what a prince ought to be
and generally is not.

"That's the wife of the English chaplain at Monte Carlo," Mary informed
Vanno, in a stage whisper, "She's an American. She called on me
yesterday; and only think, though she'd never seen me before, she said
she would like me to visit her."

"Did you accept?" Vanno asked.

Mary shook her head. "No. It would have hurt Lady Dauntrey's feelings,
perhaps. And besides, yesterday I--I thought of going away soon, to
Italy--to Florence. I was travelling to Florence when suddenly it
occurred to me to get off at Monte Carlo instead. Oh, how thankful I am
now! Think, if we had never met?"

"We should have met. I was following you from Marseilles, you know, and
watching to see where you got off. What can your people have been made
of, letting you run about alone--a girl like you?"

"Oh, but I have no people--who count. Only such a disagreeable aunt and
her daughter! I haven't written to them since I came here. I
telegraphed, and gave no address. I shall not write--until--until----"

"I know what you mean, though you won't say it. 'Until we are married.'
You need not, unless you like, for they must have been brutes of women
to have been disagreeable to you. But I wish you would stay with this
lady--the chaplain's wife. Or else with my sister-in-law. I shall go to
see her and Angelo to-morrow morning, and tell them about you. I'll ask
them to call at once, and then--I feel almost sure--Marie will invite
you to visit her. Would you accept? For that would be best of all. And
in any case we must be married from their house."

"Marie!" Mary echoed the name, her voice dwelling upon it caressingly.
"Marie! That was the name of my--not my best, but my second best friend
at school. We were three Maries. It will be good of your Marie to call
on me; but she is a bride, and it's still her honeymoon. Do you think,
if we--that is----"
