LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF PETER WILKINS., VOL. I.

BY ROBERT PALTOCK, OF CLEMENT'S INN.

Collection Of Old English Plays," Etc.


1884.


PREFACE.

In one of those bright racy essays at which modern dulness delights to
sneer, Hazlitt discussed the question whether the desire of posthumous
fame is a legitimate aspiration; and the conclusion at which he arrived
was that there is "something of egotism and even of pedantry in this
sentiment." It is a true saying in literature as in morality that "he
that seeketh his life shall lose it." The world cares most for those who
have cared least for the world's applause. A nameless minstrel of the
North Country sings a ballad that shall stir men's hearts from age to
age with haunting melody; Southey, toiling at his epics, is excluded
from Parnassus. Some there are who have knocked at the door of the
Temple of Fame, and have been admitted at once and for ever. When
Thucydides announced that he intended his history to be a "possession
for all time," there was no mistaking the tone of authority. But to be
enthroned in state, to receive the homage of the admiring multitude, and
then to be rejected as a pretender,--that is indeed a sorry fate, and
one that may well make us pause before envying literary despots their
titles. The more closely a writer shrouds himself from view, the more
eager are his readers to get a sight of him. The loss of an arm or a leg
would be a slight price for a genuine student to pay if only he could
discover one new fact about Shakespeare's history. I will not attempt to
impose on the reader's credulity by professing myself eager to acquire
information about the author of "Peter Wilkins" at such a sacrifice; but
it would have been a sincere pleasure to me if I could have brought to
light some particulars about one whose personality must have possessed
a more than ordinary charm. The delightful _voyage imaginaire_ here
presented to the reader was first published in 1751.*

     * Some copies are said to be dated 1750. It appears on the
     list of new books announced in the "Gentleman's Magazine"
     for November 1750.

An edition appeared immediately afterwards at Dublin; so the book must
have had some sale. The introduction and the dedication to the Countess
of Northumberland (to whom it will be remembered Percy dedicated his
"Reliques" and Goldsmith the first printed copy of his "Edwin and
Angelina") are signed with the initials "R. P.;" and for many years the
author's full name was unknown. In 1835, Nicol, the printer, sold by
auction a number of books and manuscripts in his possession, which
had once belonged to Dodsley, the publisher; and when these were being
catalogued, the original agreement * for the sale of the MS. of "Peter
Wilkins" was brought to light.

     * It is now in the collection, shortly to be dispersed, of
     the late Mr. James Crossley of Manchester, a gentleman who
     was esteemed throughout his long life not less for unfailing
     courtesy than for rare scholarship. Mr. Crossley promised to
     search for the document and send me a transcript of it; but
     his kind intention was frustrated by his death. Paltock's
     name is sometimes written Pultock or Poltock. There is no
     ground for identifying the author of "Peter Wilkins" with
     the "R. P., Gent.," who published in 1751 "Memoirs of the
     Life of Parnese, a Spanish Lady, Translated from the Spanish
     MS."

From this document it appeared that the author was Robert Paltock of
Clement's Inn, and that he received for the copyright 20L., twelve
copies of the book, and "the cuts of the first impression"(proof
impressions of the illustrations). The writer's name shows him to have
been, like his hero, of Cornish origin; but the authors of the admirable
and exhaustive "Bibliotheca Cornubiensis" could discover nothing about
him beyond the fact that he was not a bencher of Clement's Inn. That
Paltock should have chosen Clement's Inn as a place of residence is
not surprising. It still keeps something of its pristine repose. The
sun-dial is still supported by the negro; the grass has not lost its
verdure, and on August evenings the plane-trees' leaves glint golden
in the sun. One may still hear the chimes at midnight as Falstaff and
Justice Shallow heard them of old. Here, where only a muffled murmur
comes from the work-a-day world, a man in the last century might have
dreamed away his life, lonely as Peter Wilkins on the island. One can
imagine the amiable recluse composing his homely romance amid such
surroundings. Perhaps it was the one labour of his life. He may have
come to the Inn originally with the aspiration of making fame and money;
and then the spirit of cloistered calm turned him from such vulgar
paths, and instead of losing his fine feelings and swelling the ranks of
the plutocrats, he gave us a charming romance for our fireside. With
the literary men of his day he seems to have had no intercourse. Not a
single mention of him is to be found among his contemporaries, and
we may be sure that he cut no brilliant figure at the club-houses. No
chorus of reviewers chimed the praises of "Peter Wilkins." So far as
I can discover, the "Monthly Review" was the only journal in which the
book was noticed, and such criticism as the following can hardly be
termed laudatory:--"Here is a very strange performance indeed. It seems
to be the illegitimate offspring of no very natural conjunction, like
'Gulliver's Travels' and 'Robinson Crusoe;' but much inferior to the
manner of these two performances as to entertainment or utility. It has
all that is impossible in the one or impossible in the other, without
the wit and spirit of the first, or the just strokes of nature and
useful lessons of morality in the second. However, if the invention of
wings for mankind to fly with is sufficient amends for all the dulness
and unmeaning extravagance of the author, we are willing to allow that
his book has some merit, and that he deserves some encouragement at
least as an able mechanic, if not as a good author." But the book
was not forgotten. A new edition appeared in 1783, and again in the
following year. It was included in Weber's "Popular Romances," 1812, and
published separately, with some charming plates by Stothard, in 1816.
Within the last fifty years it has been frequently issued, entire or
mutilated, in a popular form. A drama founded on the romance was acted
at Covent Garden on April 16, 1827; and more than once of late years
"Peter Wilkins" has afforded material for pantomimes. In 1763 a French
translation (by Philippe Florent de Puisieux) appeared under the title
of "Les Hommes Volants, ou les Aventures de Pierre Wilkins," which was
included in vols. xxii.-xxiii. of DePerthe's "Voyages Imaginaires" (
1788-89). A German translation was published in 1767, having for title
"Die fliegenden Menschen, oder wunderbare Begebenheiten Peter Wilkins."
Whether the author lived to see the translations of this work cannot
be ascertained. A Robert Paltock was buried at Ryme Intrinseca Church,
Dorset, in 1767, aged seventy (Hutchin's "Dorset," iv. 493-494, third
edition), but it is very doubtful whether he was the author of the
romance.

Paltock's fame may be said to be firmly established. An American writer,
it is true, in a recent "History of Fiction," says not a word about
"Peter Wilkins;" but, we must remember, another American wrote a
"History of Caricature" without mentioning Rowlandson. Coleridge admired
the book, and is reported to have said: "Peter Wilkins is, to my mind, a
work of uncommon beauty.... I believe that 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Peter
Wilkins' could only have been written by islanders. No continentalist
could have conceived either tale.... It would require a very peculiar
genius to add another tale _ejusdem generis_ to 'Robinson Crusoe' and
'Peter Wilkins.' I once projected such a thing, but the difficulty of
the preoccupied ground stopped me. Perhaps La Motte Fouqué might effect
something; but I should fear that neither he nor any other German could
entirely understand what may be called the _desert island_ feeling.
I would try the marvellous line of 'Peter Wilkins' if I attempted it
rather than the real fiction of 'Robinson Crusoe'" ("Table-Talk," 1851,
pp. 331-332). Southey, in a note on a passage of the "Curse of Kehama,"
went so far as to say that Paltock's winged people "are the most
beautiful creatures of imagination that ever were devised," and added
that Sir Walter Scott was a warm admirer of the book. With Charles Lamb
at Christ's Hospital the story was a favourite. "We had classics of our
own," he says, "without being beholden to 'insolent Greece or haughty
Rome,' that passed current among us--'Peter Wilkins,' the 'Adventures of
the Hon. Captain Robert Boyle,' the 'Fortunate Blue-Coat Boy,' and the
like." But nobody loved the old romance with such devotion as Leigh
Hunt. He was never tired of discoursing about its beauties, and he wrote
with such thorough appreciation of his subject that he left little or
nothing for another to add. "It is interesting," he writes in one place,
"to fancy R. P., or 'Mr. Robert Paltock of Clement's Inn,' a gentle
lover of books, not successful enough, perhaps, as a barrister to lead a
public or profitable life, but eking out a little employment or a bit
of a patrimony with literature congenial to him, and looking oftener
to 'Purchase Pilgrims' on his shelves than to 'Coke on Littleton.' We
picture him to ourselves with 'Robinson Crusoe' on one side of him and
'Gaudentio di Lucca' on the other, hearing the pen go over his paper
in one of those quiet rooms in Clement's Inn that look out of its
old-fashioned buildings into the little garden with the dial in it held
by the negro: one of the prettiest corners in London, and extremely fit
for a sequestered fancy that cannot get any further. There he sits,
the unknown, ingenious, and amiable Mr. Robert Paltock, thinking of an
imaginary beauty for want of a better, and creating her for the delight
of posterity, though his contemporaries were to know little or nothing
of her. We shall never go through the place again without regarding him
as its crowning interest.... Now a sweeter creature [than Youwarkee] is
not to be found in books; and she does him immortal honour. She is all
tenderness and vivacity; all born good taste and blessed companionship.
Her pleasure consists but in his; she prevents all his wishes; has
neither prudery nor immodesty; sheds not a tear but from right feeling;
is the good of his home and the grace of his fancy. It has been well
observed that the author has not made his flying women in general light
and airy enough... And it may be said, on the other hand, that the
kind of wing, the graundee, or elastic drapery which opens and shuts
at pleasure, however ingeniously and even beautifully contrived, would
necessitate creatures whose modifications of humanity, bodily and
mental, though never so good after their kind, might have startled the
inventor had he been more of a naturalist; might have developed a being
very different from the feminine, sympathising, and lovely Youwarkee.
Muscles and nerves not human must have been associated with inhuman
wants and feelings; probably have necessitated talons and a beak! At
best the woman would have been wilder, more elvish, capricious, and
unaccountable. She would have ruffled her whalebones when angry; been
horribly intimate, perhaps, with birds' nests and fights with eagles;
and frightened Wilkins out of his wits with dashing betwixt rocks and
pulling the noses of seals and gulls. ("Book for a Corner," 1868, i. 68,
&c.) Could criticism be more delightful? But in the "London Journal,"
November 5, 1834, the genial essayist's fancy dallied even more daintily
with the theme: "A peacock with his plumage displayed, full of 'rainbows
and starry eyes,' is a fine object, but think of a lovely woman set in
front of an ethereal shell and wafted about like a Venus.... We are to
picture to ourselves a nymph in a vest of the finest texture and most
delicate carnation. On a sudden this drapery parts in two and flies
back, stretched from head to foot like an oval fan or an umbrella; and
the lady is in front of it, preparing to sweep blushing away from us and
'winnow the buxom air.'"

For many of us the conduct of life is becoming evermore a thing of
greater perplexity. It is wearisome to be rudely jostling one another
for the world's prizes, while myriads are toiling round us in an
Egyptian bondage unlit by one ray of sunshine from the cradle to the
grave. Some have attained to Lucretian heights of philosophy, whence
they look with indifference over the tossing world-wide sea of human
misery; but others are fain to avert their eyes, to clean forget for a
season the actual world and lose themselves in the mazes of romance. In
moments of despondency there is no greater relief to a fretted spirit
than to turn to the "Odyssey" or Mr. Payne's exquisite translation of
the "Arabian Nights." Great should be our gratitude to Mr. Morris for
teaching us in golden verse that "Love is Enough," and for spreading
wide the gates of his "Earthly Paradise." Lucian's "True History," that
carries us over unknown seas beyond the Atlantic bounds to enchanted
islands in the west, is one of those books which we do not half
appreciate. And among the world's benefactors Robert Paltock deserves a
place. An idle hour could not be spent in a much pleasanter way than in
watching Peter Wilkins go a-field with his gun or haul up the beast-fish
at the lonely creek. What can be more delightful than the description
how, wakened from dreams of home by the noise of strange voices
overhead, he sees fallen at his door the lovely winged woman Youwarkee!
Prudish people may be scandalised at the unreserved frankness shown
in the account of the consummation of Wilkins' marriage with this fair
creature; but the editor was unwilling to mutilate the book in the
interests of such refined readers. A man or a woman who can find
anything to shock his or her feelings in the description of Youwarkee's
bridal night deserves the commiseration of sensible people. Very
charming is the picture of the children sitting round the fire on the
long winter evenings listening wide-eyed to the ever-fresh story of
their father's marvellous adventures. The wholesome morality, the
charitableness and homely piety apparent throughout, give the narrative
a charm denied to many works of greater literary pretension. When Peter
Wilkins leaves his solitary home to live among the winged people, the
interest of the story, it must be confessed, is somewhat diminished.
The author's obligations to Swift in the latter part of the book are
considerable; and of course in describing how Peter Wilkins ordered his
life on the lonely island, he was largely indebted to Defoe. But the
creation of the winged beings is Paltock's own. It has been suggested
that he named his hero after John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, who, among
other curious theories, had seriously discussed the question whether men
could acquire the art of flying. In the second part of his "Mathematical
Magick," the Bishop writes: "Those things that seem very difficult
and fearfull at the first may grow very facil after frequent trial and
exercise: And therefore he that would effect any thing in this kind
must be brought up to the constant practice of it from his Youth; trying
first only to use his wings in running on the ground, as an Estrich or
tame geese will do, touching the earth with his toes; and so by degrees
learn to rise higher till he shall attain unto skill and confidence.
I have heard it from credible testimony that one of our nation hath
proceeded so far in this experiment that he was able by the help of
wings to skip constantly ten yards at a time." Youwarkee spread wide her
graundee, and in an instant was lost in the clouds. Had the author given
her the motion of a goose, or even of an ostrich--bah! the thought is
too dreadful.

Judicious reader, the long winter evenings have come round, and you have
now abundance of leisure. Let the poets stand idle on the shelves
till the return of spring, unless perchance you would fain resume
acquaintance with the "Seasons," which you have not read since a boy,
or would divert yourself with Prior or be grave with Crabbe. Now is the
time to feel once more the charm of Lamb's peerless and unique essays;
now is the time to listen to the honied voice of Leigh Hunt discoursing
daintily of men and books. So you will pass from Charles Lamb and Leigh
Hunt to the books they loved to praise. Exult in the full-blooded,
bracing life which pulses in the pages of Fielding; and if Smollett's
mirth is occasionally too riotous and his taste too coarse, yet confess
that all faults must be pardoned to the author of "Humphry Clinker."
Many a long evening you will spend pleasantly with Defoe; and then,
perchance, after a fresh reading of the thrice and four times wonderful
adventures of Robinson Crusoe, you will turn to the romance of "Peter
Wilkins." So may rheums and catarrhs be far from you, and may your
hearth be crowned with content!

LIFE AND ADVENTURES

OF

PETER WILKINS.

A Cornish Man:

Relating particularly,

His Shipwreck near the South Pole; his wonderful Passage thro' a
subterraneous Cavern into a kind of new World; his there meeting with a
Gawry or flying woman, whose Life he preserv'd, and afterwards married
her; his extraordinary Conveyance to the Country of Glums and Gawrys, or
Men and Women that fly. Likewise a Description of this strange Country,
with the Laws, Customs, and Manners of its Inhabitants, and the Author's
remarkable Transactions among them.

Taken from his own Mouth, in his Passage to England from off Cape Horn
in America, in the ship Hector,

With an INTRODUCTION, giving an Account of the surprizing Manner of his
coming on board that Vessel, and his Death on his landing at Plymouth in
the Year 1739.

Illustrated with several Cuts, clearly and distinctly representing the
Structure and Mechanism of the Wings of the Glums and Gawrys, and the
Manner in which they use them either to swim or fly.


To the Right Honourable

ELIZABETH,

Countess of Northumberland, Madam,

Few Authors, I believe, who write in my Way (whatever View they may set
out with) can, in the Prosecution of their Works, forbear to dress their
fictitious Characters in the real Ornaments themselves have been most
delighted with.

THIS, I confess, hath been my Case, in the Person of _Youwarkee_, in
the following Sheets; for having formed her Body, I found myself at an
inexpressible Loss how to adorn her Mind in the masterly Sentiments
I coveted to endue her with; 'till I recollected the most aim[i]able
Pattern in your Ladyship; a single View of which, at a Time of the
utmost fatigue to his Lordship, hath charmed my Imagination ever since.

If a Participater of the Cares of Life in general, alleviates the
Concerns of Man; what an invaluable Blessing must that Lady prove, to
the Softness of whose Sex Nature hath conjoined an Aptitude for Council,
an Application, Zeal, and Dispatch but too rarely found in his own!

Had my Situation in Life been so happy as to have presented me with
Opportunities of more frequent and minuter Remarks upon your Ladyship's
Conduct, I might have defy'd the whole _British_ Fair to have outshone
my southern Gawry: For if, to a majestic Form and extensive Capacity, I
had been qualified to have copied that natural Sweetness of Disposition,
that maternal Tenderness, that Cheerfulness, that Complacency,
Condescension, Affability, and unaffected Benevolence, which so
apparently distinguish the Countess of _Northumberland_; I had exhibited
in my _Youwarkee_ a Standard for future Generations.

Madam, I am the more sensible of my Speaking but the Truth from the
late Instance of your Benignity, which entitles me to the Honour of
subscribing myself,

Madam, Your Ladyship's

most obliged and

most obedient Servant,

R. P.

THE INTRODUCTION.

It might be looked upon as impertinent in me, who am about to give the
life of another, to trouble the reader with any of my own concerns,
or the affairs that led me into the South Seas. Therefore I shall only
acquaint him, that in my return on board the "Hector," as a passenger,
round Cape Horn, for England, full late in the season, the wind and
currents setting strong against us, our ship drove more southernly, by
several degrees, than the usual course, even to the latitude of 75 or
76; when the wind chopping about, we began to resume our intended
way. It was about the middle of June, when the days are there at the
shortest, on a very starry and moonlight night, that we observed at some
distance a very black cloud, but seemingly of no extraordinary size or
height, moving very fast towards us, and seeming to follow the ship,
which then made great way. Every one on deck was very curious in
observing its motions; and perceiving it frequently to divide, and
presently to close again, and not to continue long in any determined
shape, our captain, who had never before been so far to the southward as
he then found himself, had many conjectures what this phenomenon might
portend; and every one offering his own opinion, it seemed at last to be
generally agreed that there might possibly be a storm gathering in the
air, of which this was the prognostic; and by its following, and nearly
keeping pace with us, we were in great fear lest it should break upon
and overwhelm us, if not carefully avoided. Our commander, therefore,
as it approached nearer and nearer, ordered one of the ship's guns to be
fired, to try if the percussion of the air would disperse it. This was
no sooner done than we heard a prodigious flounce in the water, at but
a small distance from the ship, on the weather-quarter; and after
a violent noise, or cry in the air, the cloud, that upon our firing
dissipated, seemed to return again, but by degrees disappeared. Whilst
we were all very much surprised at this unexpected accident, I, being
naturally very curious and inquisitive into the causes of all unusual
incidents, begged the captain to send the boat to see, if possible, what
it was that had fallen from the cloud, and offered myself to make one in
her. He was much against this at first, as it would retard his voyage,
now we were going so smoothly before the wind. But in the midst of
our debate, we plainly heard a voice calling out for help, in our own
tongue, like a person in great distress. I then insisted on going, and
not suffering a fellow-creature to perish for the sake of a trifling
delay. In compliance with my resolute demand, he slackened sail; and
hoisting out the boat, myself and seven others made to the cry, and soon
found it to come from an elderly man, labouring for life, with his arms
across several long poles, of equal size at both ends, very light, and
tied to each other in a very odd manner. The sailors at first were very
fearful of assisting or coming near him, crying to each other, "He must
be a monster!" and perhaps might overset the boat and destroy them; but
hearing him speak English, I was very angry with them for their foolish
apprehensions, and caused them to clap their oars under him, and at
length we got him into the boat. He had an extravagant beard, and also
long blackish hair upon his head. As soon as he could speak (for he
was almost spent), he very familiarly took me by the hand, I having set
myself close by him to observe him, and squeezing it, thanked me very
kindly for my civility to him, and likewise thanked all the sailors. I
then asked him by what possible accident he came there; but he shook
his head, declining to satisfy my curiosity. Hereupon reflecting that it
might just then be troublesome for him to speak, and that we should
have leisure enough in our voyage for him to relate, and me to hear, his
story (which, from the surprising manner of his falling amongst us, I
could not but believe would contain something very remarkable), I waived
any farther speech with him at that time.

We had him to the ship, and taking off his wet clothes, put him to bed
in my cabin; and I having a large provision of stores on board, and
no concern in the ship, grew very fond of him, and supplied him with
everything he wanted. In our frequent discourses together, he had
several times dropped loose hints of his past transactions, which but
the more inflamed me with impatience to hear the whole of them. About
this time, having just begun to double the Cape, our captain thought of
watering at the first convenient place; and finding the stranger had no
money to pay his passage, and that he had been from England no less than
thirty-five years, despairing of his reward for conducting him thither,
he intimated to him that he must expect to be put on shore to shift for
himself, when we put in for water. This entirely sunk the stranger's
spirits, and gave me great concern, insomuch that I fully resolved, if
the captain should really prove such a brute, to take the payment of his
passage on myself.

As we came nearer to the destined watering, the captain spoke the
plainer of his intentions (for I had not yet hinted my design to him
or any one else); and one morning the stranger came into my cabin, with
tears in his eyes, telling me he verily believed the captain would be
as good as his word, and set him on shore, which he very much dreaded.
I did not choose to tell him immediately what I designed in his favour,
but asked him if he could think of no way of satisfying the captain,
or any one else, who might thereupon be induced to engage for him; and
farther, how he expected to live when he should get to England, a man
quite forgotten and penniless. Hereupon he told me he had, ever since
his being on board, considering his destitute condition, entertained a
thought of having his adventures written; which, as there was something
so uncommon in them, he was sure the world would be glad to know; and he
had flattered himself with hopes of raising somewhat by the sale of them
to put him in a way of living; but as it was plain now he should never
see England without my assistance, if I would answer for his passage,
and write his life, he would communicate to me a faithful narrative
thereof, which he believed would pay me to the full any charge I might
be at on his account. I was very well pleased with this overture, not
from the prospect of gain by the copy, but from the expectation I had of
being fully satisfied in what I had so long desired to know; so I told
him I would make him easy in that respect. This quite transported
him: he caressed me, and called me his deliverer, and was then going
open-mouthed to the captain to tell him so. But I put a stop to that:
For, says I, though I insist upon hearing your story, the captain may
yet relent of his purpose, and not leave you on shore; and if that
should prove the case, I shall neither part with my money for you, nor
you with your interest in your adventures to me. Whereupon he agreed I
was right, and desisted.

When we had taken in best part of our water, and the boat was going its
last turn, the captain ordered up the strange man, as they called him,
and told him he must go on board the boat, which was to leave him on
shore with some few provisions. I happening to hear nothing of these
orders, they were so sudden, the poor man was afraid, after all, he
should have been hurried to land without my knowledge: but begging very
hard of the captain only for leave to speak with me before he went, I
was called (though with some reluctance, for the captain disliked me
for the liberties I frequently took with him, on account of his brutal
behaviour). I expostulated with the cruel wretch on the inhumanity of
the action he was about; telling him, if he had resolved the poor man
should perish, it would have been better to have suffered him to do so
when he was at the last extremity, than to expose him afresh, by this
means, to a death as certain, in a more lingering and miserable way. But
the savage being resolved, and nothing moved by what I said, I paid him
part of the passage down, and agreed to pay the rest at our arrival in
England.

Thus having reprieved the poor man, the next thing was to enter upon my
new employ of amanuensis: and having a long space of time before us,
we allotted two hours every morning for the purpose of writing down his
life from his own mouth; and frequently, when wind and weather kept us
below, we spent some time of an afternoon in the same exercise, till
we had quite completed it. But then there were some things in it so
indescribable by words, that if I had not had some knowledge in drawing,
our history had been very incomplete. Thus it must have been, especially
in the description of the _Glumms_ and _Gawrys_ therein mentioned. In
order to gain (that so I might communicate) a clear idea of these, I
made several drawings of them from his discourses and accounts; and,
at length, after divers trials, I made such exact delineations, that
he declared they could not have been more perfect resemblances if I had
drawn them from the life. Upon a survey, he confessed the very persons
themselves could not have been more exact. I also drew with my pencil
the figure of an aerial engagement, which, having likewise had his
approbation, I have given a draught of, plate the sixth.

Then, having finished the work to our mutual satisfaction, I locked it
up, in order to peruse it at leisure, intending to have presented it to
him at our arrival in England, to dispose of as he pleased, in such
a way as might have conduced most to his profit; for I resolved,
notwithstanding our agreement, and the obligations he was under to
me, that the whole of that should be his own. But he, having been in a
declining state some time before we reached shore, died the very night
we landed; and his funeral falling upon me, I thought I had the greatest
right to the manuscript, which, however, I had no design to have parted
with; but showing it to some judicious friends, I have by them been
prevailed with not to conceal from the world what may prove so very
entertaining, and perhaps useful.

A GENUINE ACCOUNT

OF THE

LIFE OF PETER WILKINS.


CHAPTER I.

Giving an account of the author's birth and family--The fondness of
his mother--His being put to an academy at sixteen by the advice of his
friend--His thoughts of his own illiterature

I was born at Penhale, in the county of Cornwall, on the 21st day of
December 1685, about four months after my father, Peter Wilkins, who
was a zealous Protestant of the Church of England, had been executed
by Jeffreys, in Somersetshire, for joining in the design of raising the
Duke of Monmouth to the British throne. I was named, after my father and
grandfather, Peter, and was my father's only child by Alice his wife,
the daughter of John Capert, a clergyman in a neighbouring village. My
grandfather was a shopkeeper at Newport, who, by great frugality and
extraordinary application, had raised a fortune of about £160 a year
in lands, and a considerable sum of ready money, all which at his
death devolved upon my father, as his only child; who, being no less
parsimonious than my grandfather, and living upon his own estate, had
much improved it in value before his marriage with my mother; but he
coming to that unhappy end, my mother, after my birth, placed all her
affection upon me (her growing hope, as she called me), and used every
method, in my minority, of increasing the store for my benefit.

In this manner she went on, till I grew too big, as I thought, for
confinement at the apron-string, being then about fourteen years of age;
and having met with so much indulgence from her, for that reason found
very little or no contradiction from anybody else; so I looked on myself
as a person of some consequence, and began to take all opportunities of
enjoying the company of my neighbours, who hinted frequently that the
restraint I was under was too great a curb upon an inclination like
mine of seeing the world; but my mother, still impatient of any little
absence, by excessive fondness, and encouraging every inclination I
seemed to have, when she could be a partaker with me, kept me within
bounds of restraint till I arrived at my sixteenth year.

About this time I got acquainted with a country gentleman, of a small
paternal estate, which had been never the better for being in his hands,
and had some uneasy demands upon it. He soon grew very fond of me,
hoping, as I had reason afterwards to believe, by a union with my
mother to set himself free from his entanglements. She was then about
thirty-five years old, and still continued my father's widow, out
of particular regard to me, as I have all the reason in the world to
believe. She was really a beautiful woman, and of a sanguine complexion,
but-had always carried herself with so much reserve, and given so little
encouragement to any of the other sex, that she had passed her widowhood
with very few solicitations to alter her way of life. This gentleman
observing my mother's conduct, in order to ingratiate himself with her,
had shown numberless instances of regard for me; and, as he told my
mother, had observed many things in my discourse, actions, and turn of
mind, that presaged wonderful expectations from me, if my genius was but
properly cultivated.

This discourse, from a man of very good parts, and esteemed by everybody
an accomplished gentleman, by degrees wrought upon my mother, and more
and more inflamed her with a desire of adding what lustre she could to
my applauded abilities, and influenced her so far as to ask his advice
in what manner most properly to proceed with me. My gentleman then had
his desire, for he feared not the widow, could he but properly dispose
of her charge; so having desired a little time to consider of a matter
of such importance, he soon after told her he thought the most useful
method of establishing me would be at an academy, kept by a very worthy
and judicious gentleman, about thirty, or more, miles from us, in
Somersetshire; where, if I could but be admitted, the master taking in
but a stated number of students at a time, he did not in the least doubt
but I should fully answer the character he had given her of me, and
outshine most of my contemporaries.

My mother, over-anxious for my good, seeming to listen to this proposal,
my friend (as I call him) proposed taking a journey himself to the
academy, to see if any place was vacant for my reception, and learn the
terms of my admission; and in three days' time returned with an engaging
account of the place, the master, the regularity of the scholars, of an
apartment secured for my reception, and, in short, whatever else might
captivate my mother's opinion in favour of his scheme; and indeed,
though he acted principally from another motive, as was plain
afterwards, I cannot help thinking he believed it to be the best way of
disposing of a lad sixteen years old, born to a pretty fortune, and who,
at that age, could but just read a chapter in the Testament; for he had
before beat my mother quite out of her inclination to a grammar-school
in the neighbourhood, from a contempt, he said, it would bring upon
me from lads much my juniors in years, by being placed in the first
rudiments of learning with them.

Well, the whole concern of my mother's little family was now employed
in fitting me out for my expedition; and as my friend had been so
instrumental in bringing it about, he never missed a day inquiring
how preparations went on; and during the process, by humouring me,
ingratiated himself more and more with my mother, but without seeming in
the least to aim at it. In short, the hour of my departure arrived; and
though I had never been master of above a sixpence at one time, unless
at a fair or so, for immediate spending, my mother, thinking to make my
heart easy at our separation (which, had it appeared otherwise, would
have broke hers, and spoiled all), gave me a double pistole in gold, and
a little silver in my pocket to prevent my changing it.

Thus I (the coach waiting for us at the door), having been preached into
a good liking of the scheme by my friend, who now insisted upon making
one of our company to introduce us, mounted the carriage with more
alacrity than could be expected for one who had never before been beyond
the smoke of his mother's chimney; but the thoughts I had conceived,
from my friend's discourse, of liberty in the academic way, and the
weight of so much money in my pocket, as I then imagined would scarce
ever be exhausted, were prevailing cordials to keep my spirits on the
wing. We lay at an inn that night, near the master's house, and the next
day I was initiated; and, at parting with me, my friend presented me
with a guinea. When I found myself thus rich, I must say I heartily
wished they were all fairly at home again, that I might have time
to count my cash, and dispose of such part of it as I had already
appropriated to several uses then in embryo.

The next morning left me master of my wishes, for my mother came and
took her last (though she little thought it) leave of me, and smothering
me with her caresses and prayers for my well-doing, in the height of
her ardour put into my hand another guinea, promising to see me again
quickly; and desiring me, in the meantime, to be a very good husband,
which I have since taken to be a sort of prophetic speech, she bid me
farewell.

I shall not trouble you with the reception I met from my master, or his
scholars, or tell you how soon I made friends of all my companions, by
some trifling largesses which my stock enabled me to bestow as occasion
required; but I must inform you that, after sixteen years of idleness at
home, I had but little heart to my nouns and pronouns, which now
began to be crammed upon me; and being the eldest lad in the house,
I sometimes regretted the loss of the time past, and at other times
despaired of ever making a scholar at my years; and was ashamed to
stand like a great lubber, declining of _hæc mulier_ a woman, whilst
my schoolfellows, and juniors by five years, were engaged in the love
stories of Ovid, or the luscious songs of Horace. I own these thoughts
almost overcame me, and threw me into a deep melancholy, of which I soon
after, by letter, informed my mother; who (by the advice, as I suppose,
of my friend, by this time her suitor) sent me word to mind my studies,
and I should want for nothing.


CHAPTER II.

     How he spent his time at the academy--An intrigue with a
     servant-maid there--She declares herself with child by him--
     Her expostulations to him--He is put to it for money--
     Refused it from home by his friend, who had married his
     mother--Is drawn in to marry the maid--She lies-in at her
     aunts--Returns to her service--He has another child by her

I had now been passing my time for about three months in this melancholy
way, and, you may imagine, under that disadvantage, had made but little
progress in my learning, when one of our maids, taking notice one day
of my uneasiness, as I sat musing in my chamber, according to my custom,
began to rally me that I was certainly in love, I was so sad. Indeed I
never had a thought of love before, but the good-natured girl seeming to
pity me, and seriously asking me the cause, I fairly opened my heart to
her; and for fear my master should know it, gave her half-a-crown to be
silent. This last engagement fixed her my devotee, and from that time
we had frequent conferences in confidence together, till at length
inclination, framed by opportunity, produced the date of a world of
concern to me; for about six months after my arrival at the academy,
instead of proving my parts by my scholarship, I had proved my manhood
by being the destined father of an infant which my female correspondent
then assured me would soon be my own.

We nevertheless held on our frequent intercourse; nor was I so alarmed
at the news as I ought to have been, till about two months after, when
Patty (for that was the only name I then knew her by) explained herself
to me in the following terms:--"You know, Mr. Peter, how matters are
with me: I should be very sorry, for your sake, and my own too, to
reveal my shame, but in spite of us both nature will show itself; and
truly I think some care should be taken, and some method proposed, to
preserve the infant, and avoid, as far as may be, the inconveniences
that may attend us, for here is now no room for delay." This speech, I
own, gave me the first reflection I ever had in my life, and locked up
all my faculties for a long time; nor was I able, for the variety of
ideas that crowded my brain, to make a word of answer, but stood like an
image of stone, till Patty, seeing my confusion, desired me to recollect
my reason; for as it was too late to undo what had been done, it
remained now only to act with that prudence and caution which the nature
of the case required; and that, for her part, she would concur in every
reasonable measure I should approve of; but I must remember she was only
a servant, and had very little due to her for wages, and not a penny
besides that; and that there must necessarily be a preparation made for
the reception of the infant when time should produce it. I now began to
see the absolute necessity of all she said, but how to accomplish it was
not in me to comprehend. My own small matter of money was gone, and had
been so a long time; we therefore agreed I should write to my mother for
a fresh supply. I did so; and to my great confusion was answered by my
former friend in the following words:--

     "Son Peter,--Your mother and I are much surprised you should
     write for money, having so amply provided for you; but as it
     is not many months to Christmas, when possibly we may send
     for you home, you must make yourself easy till then; as a
     school-boy, with all necessaries found him, cannot have much
     occasion for money.--Your loving father,
     J. G."

Imagine, if it is possible, my consternation at the receipt of this
letter. I began to think I should be tricked out of what my father and
grandfather had with so much pains and industry for many years been,
heaping up for me, and had a thousand thoughts all together jostling out
each other, so could resolve on nothing. I then showed Patty the letter,
and we both condoled my hard fortune, but saw no remedy. Time wore away,
and nothing done, or like to be, as I could see. For my part, I was like
one distracted, and no more able to assist or counsel what should be
done than a child in arms. At length poor Patty, who had sat thinking
some time, began with telling me she had formed a scheme which in some
measure might help us; but fearing it might be disagreeable to me, she
durst not mention it till I should assure her, whatever I thought of
that, I would think no worse of her for proposing it. This preparatory
introduction startled me a great deal; for it darted into my head she
waited for my concurrence to destroy the child, to which I could never
have consented. But upon my assuring her I would not think the worse of
her for whatever she should propose, but freely give her my opinion upon
it, she told me, as she could see no other way before us but what tended
to our disgrace and ruin, if I would marry her she would immediately
quit her place and return to her aunt, who had brought her up from a
child, and had enough prettily to live upon, who, she did not doubt,
would entertain her as my wife; but she was assured, upon any other
score, or under any other name, would prove her most inveterate
enemy. When Patty had made an end, I was glad to find it no worse; and
revolving matters a little in my mind, both as to affairs at home and
the requested marriage, I concluded upon this latter, and had a great
inclination to acquaint my mother of it, but was diverted from that, by
suspecting it might prove a good handle for my new father to work with
my mother some mischief against me; so determined to marry forthwith,
send Patty to her aunt's, and remain still at the academy myself till
I should see what turn things would take at home. Accordingly, the next
day good part of Patty's wages went to tie the connubial knot, and to
the honest parson for a bribe to antedate the certificate; and she very
soon after took up the rest to defray her journey to her aunt's.

Though Patty was within two months of her time, she had so managed that
no one perceived it; and getting safe to her aunt's, was delivered of
a daughter, of which she wrote me word, and said she hoped to see me at
the end of her month. How, thought I, can she expect to see me; money I
have none! and then I despaired of leave for a journey if I had it;
and to go without leave would only arm J. G. against me, as I perceived
plainly his interest and mine were very remote things; so I resolved to
quit all thoughts of a journey, and wait till opportunity better served
for seeing my wife and child, and our good aunt to whom we were so
much obliged. While these and such-like cogitations engrossed my whole
attention, I was most pleasingly surprised one day, upon my return-from
a musing walk by the river-side at the end of our garden, where I
frequently got my tasks, to find Patty sitting in the kitchen with my
old mistress, my master's mother, who managed his house, he having been
a widower many years. The sight of her almost overcame me, as I had
bolted into the kitchen, and was seen by my old mistress before I
had seen Patty was with her. The old lady, perceiving me discomposed,
inquired into the cause, which I directly imputed to the symptoms of an
ague that I told her I had felt upon me best part of the morning. She,
a good motherly woman, feeling my pulse, and satisfying herself of its
disorder, immediately ran to her closet to bring me a cordial, which she
assured me had done wonders in the like cases; so that I had but just
time to embrace Patty and inquire after our aunt and daughter before
madam returned with the cordial. Having drank it, and given thanks, I
was going to withdraw, but she would not part with me so; for nothing
less than my knowledge that this cordial was of her own making, from
whence she had the receipt, and an exact catalogue of the several cures
it had done, would serve her turn; which, taking up full three-quarters
of an hour, gave room to Patty and me to enjoy each other's glances for
that time, to our mutual satisfaction. At last the old prattlebox
having made a short pause to recover breath from the narrative of the
cordial, "Mr. Peter," says she, "you look as if you did not know poor
Patty; she has not left me so long that you should forget her; she is
a good tight wench, and I was sorry to part with her; but she is out of
place, she says, and as that dirty creature Nan is gone, I think to take
her again." I told her I well knew she was judge of a good servant, and
I did not doubt Patty was such, if she thought so; and then I made my
exit, lighter in heart by a pound than I came.

I shall not tire you any farther with the amours between self and Patty;
but to let you know she quitted her place again seven months after, upon
the same score.


CHAPTER III.

     Minds his studies--Informs his master of his mother's
     marriage, and usage of him--Hears of her death--Makes his
     master his guardian--Goes with him to take possession of his
     estate--Is informed all is given to his father-in-law--Moral
     reflections on his condition, and on his father's crimes.

I was now near nineteen years of age; and though I had so much more in
my head than my school-learning, I know not how it happened, but ever
since the commencement of my amour with Patty, having somebody to
disburden my mind to, and to participate in my concerns, I had been
much easier, and had kept true tally with my book, with more than usual
delight; and being arrived to an age to comprehend what I heard and
read, I could, from the general idea I had of things, form a pretty
regular piece of Latin, without being able to repeat the very rules it
was done by; so that I had the acknowledgment of my master for the best
capacity he ever had under his tuition: this, he not sparing frequently
to mention it before me, was the acutest spur he could have applied to
my industry; and now, having his good will, I began to disuse set hours
of exercise, but at my conveniency applied myself to my studies as I
best pleased, being always sure to perform as much, or more, than he
ever enjoined me; till I grew exceedingly in his confidence, and by
reason of my age (though I was but small, yet manly) I became rather his
companion upon parties than his direct pupil.

It was upon one of these parties I took the opportunity to declare the
dissatisfaction I had at my mother's second marriage. "Sir," says I,
"surely I was of age to have known it first, especially considering the
affection my mother had always shown to me, and my never once having
done the least thing to disoblige her; but, sir," said I, "something
else, I fear, is intended by my mother's silence to me; for I have never
received above three letters from her since I came here, which is now,
you know, three years, and those were within the first three months.
I then showed him the fore-mentioned letter I received from my new
father-in-law, and assured him that gave me the first hint of this
second marriage."

I found, by the attention my master gave to my relation, he seemed to
suspect this marriage would prove detrimental to me; but not on the
sudden knowing what to say to it, he told me he would consider of it;
and, by all means, advised me to write a very obliging letter to my new
father, with my humble request that he would please to order me home the
next recess of our learning. I did so under my master's dictation; and
not long after received an answer to the following effect:--

"Son Peter,--Your mother has been dead a good while; and as to your
request, it will be only expensive, and of little use; for a person who
must live by his studies can't apply to them too closely."

This letter, if I had a little hope left, quite subdued my fortitude,
and well-nigh reduced me to clay. However, with tears in my eyes, I
showed it to my master, who, good man! wishing me well, "Peter," says
he, "what can this mean? here is some mystery concealed in it; here
is some ill design on foot!" Then taking the letter into his hand, "A
person who must live by his studies," says he; "here is more meant than
we can think for. Why, have not you a pretty estate to live upon, when
it comes to your hands? Peter," says he, "I would advise you to go to
your father and inquire how your affairs are left; but I am afraid
to let you go alone, and will, when my students depart at Christmas,
accompany you myself with all my heart; for you must know I have advised
on your affair already, and find you are of age to choose yourself a
guardian, who may be any relation or friend you can confide in; and may
see you have justice done you." I immediately thanked him for the hint,
and begged him to accept of the trust, as my only friend, having very
few, if any, near relations: this he with great readiness complied with,
and was admitted accordingly.

So soon as our scholars were gone home, my master lending me a horse,
we set out together to possess ourselves of all my father's real estate,
and such part of the personal as he had been advised would belong to
me. Well, we arrived at the old house, but were not received with such
extraordinary tokens of friendship as would give the least room to
suppose we were welcome. For my part, all I said, or could say, was that
I was very sorry for my mother's death. My father replied so was he.
Here we paused, and might have sat silent till this time for me, if my
master, a grave man, who had seen the world, and was unwilling any part
of our time there, which we guessed would be short, should be lost, had
not broke silence. "Mr. G." says he, "I see the loss of Master Wilkins's
mother puts him under some confusion; so that you will excuse me, as his
preceptor and friend, in making some inquiry how his affairs stand, and
how his effects are disposed, as I don't doubt you have taken care to
schedule everything that will be coming to him; and though he is not
yet of the necessary age for taking upon himself the management of his
estate, he is nevertheless of capacity to understand the nature and
quantum of it, and to show his approbation of the disposition of it,
as if he was a year or two older." During this discourse, Mr. G. turned
pale, then reddened, was going to interrupt, then checked himself; but
however kept silence till my master had done; when, with a sneer, he
replied, "Sir, I must own myself a great stranger to your discourse; nor
can I, for my life, imagine what your harangue tends to; but sure I am,
I know of no estate, real or personal, or anything else belonging to
young Mr. Wilkins, to make a schedule of, as you call it: but this I
know, his mother had an estate in land, near two hundred a year, and
also a good sum of money when I married her; but the estate she settled
on me before her marriage, to dispose of after her decease as I saw fit;
and her money and goods are all come to my sole use, as her husband." I
was just ready to drop while Mr. G. gave this relation, and was not able
to reply a word; but my master, though sufficiently shocked at what he
had heard, replied, "Sir, I am informed the estate, and also the money
you mention, was Mr. Wilkins's father's at his death; and I am surprised
to think any one should have a better title to them than my pupil, his
only child."--"Sir," says Mr. G., "you are deceived; and though what you
say seems plausible enough, and is in some part true, as that the late
Mr. Wilkins had such estate, and some hundreds--I may say thousands--at
his death; yet you seem ignorant that he made a deed, just before
entering into the fatal rebellion, by which he gave my late wife both
the estate, money, and everything else he had, absolutely, without any
conditions whatsoever; all which, on his unhappy execution, she enjoyed,
and now of right, as I told you before, belongs to me. However, as
I have no child, if Peter behaves well under your direction, I have
thoughts of paying another year's board for him, and then he must shift
for himself."--"Oh!" cried I, "for the mercy of some savage beast to
devour me! Is this what I have been cockered up for? Why was I not
placed out to some laborious craft, where I might have drudged for bread
in my proper station? But I fear it is too late to inquire into what is
past, and must submit."

My master, good man! was thunderstruck at what he had heard; and finding
our business done there, we took our leaves; after Mr. G. had again
repeated, that if I behaved well, my preceptor should keep me another
year, which was all I must expect from him; and at my departure he gave
me a crown-piece, which I then durst not refuse, for fear of offending
my master.

We made the best of our way home again to my tutor's, where I stayed but
a week to consider what I should do for myself. In this time he did all
he could to comfort me; telling me if I would stay with him and become
his usher, he would complete my learning for nothing, and allow me a
salary for my trouble. But my heart was too lofty to think of becoming
an usher within so little way from mine own estate in other hands.
However, since I had not a penny of money to endeavour at recovering my
right with, I told my master I would consider of his proposal.

During my stay with him he used all methods to make me as easy as
possible; and frequently moralised with so much effect, that I was
almost convinced I ought to submit and be content. Amongst the rest
of his discourse, he endeavoured to show me (one day after I had been
loudly condemning my cruel fortune, and saying I was born to be unhappy)
that I was mistaken if I thought or imagined it was chance or accident
that had been against me when I complained of fortune. "For," says he,
"Peter, there is nothing done below but is at least foreknown, if not
decreed, above; and our business in life is to believe so: not that I
would have such belief make us careless, and think it to no purpose to
strive, as some do; who, being persuaded that our actions are not in our
own choice, but that, being pressed by an irresistible decree, we
are forced to act this or that, fancy we must be necessarily happy or
miserable hereafter; or, as others, who, for fear of falling upon that
shocking principle, would even deprive the Almighty of foreknowledge,
lest it should consequentially amount to a decree: for, say they, what
is foreknown, will and must be. But I would have you act so as that, let
either of these tenets be true, you may still be sure of making yourself
easy and happy; and for that purpose let me recommend to you a uniform
life of justice and piety; always choosing the good rather than the bad
side of every action: for this, say they what they will to the contrary,
is not above the power of a reasonable being to practise: and doing so,
you may without scruple say,--If there is foreknowledge of my actions,
or they are decreed, I then am one who is foreknown or decreed to be
happy. And this, without farther speculation, you will find the only
means always to keep you so; for all men, of all denominations, fully
allow this happy effect to follow good actions. Again, Peter, a person
acting in a vicious course, with such an opinion in his head as above,
must surely be very miserable, as his very actions themselves must
pronounce the decree against him: whilst, therefore, we have not heard
the decree read, you see we may easily give sentence whether it be for
good or evil to us, by the tenor and course of our own actions.

"You are not now to learn, Peter, that the crimes of the father are
often punished in the children, often in the father himself, sometimes
in both, and not seldom in neither, in this life; and though, at first,
one should think the future punishment annexed to bad actions was
sufficient, still it is necessary some should suffer here also for an
example to others; we being much more affected with what the eye sees,
than what the heart only meditates upon.

"Now, to bring it to our own case; your father, Peter, rose against the
lawful magistrate, to deprive him (it matters not that he was a bad one)
of his lawful power. Your father's policy was such, and his design so
well laid, as he thought, that upon any ill success to himself, he had
secured his estate to go in the way of all others he could wish to have
it, and sits down very well contented that, happen what would, he should
bite the Government in preventing the forfeiture. But lo! his policy
is as a wall of sand blown down with a puff! for it is to you it ought,
even himself being umpire, to have come, as no one would think he would
prize any before you, his own child. Now, could he look from the grave,
and know what passes here, and see Mr. G. in possession of all he
fancied he had secured for you, what a weak and short-sighted creature
would he find himself! If it be said he did not know he should have a
child, then herein appears God's policy beyond man's; for He knew it,
and has so ordered that that child should be disinherited; for, by the
way, Peter, take this for a maxim, wherever the first principle of an
action is ill, no good consequence can possibly ever be an attendant on
it. Could he, as I said before, but look up and see you, his only child,
undone by the very instrument he designed for your security, how
pungent would be his anxiety! I say, Peter, though there is something
so unaccountable to human wisdom in such events of things, yet there is
something therein so reasonable and just withal, that by a prying eye,
the Supreme Hand may very visibly be seen in them. Now, this being
plainly the case before us, and herein the glory of the Almighty
exalted, rest content under it, and let not this disappointment,
befallen you for your father's faults, be attended with others sent down
for your own; but remember this, the Hand that depresses a man is no
less able to exalt and establish him."


CHAPTER IV.

     Departs secretly from his master--Travels to Bristol--
     Religious thoughts by the way--Enters on shipboard, and is
     made captain's steward

I seemed to be very well satisfied whilst my master was speaking; but
though I thought he talked like an angel, my former uneasiness seized me
at parting with him. In short, without more consideration, I rose in
the morning early and marched off, having first wrote to my wife at her
aunt's, relating the state of the case to her, with my resolution to
leave England the first opportunity, giving her what comfort I could,
assuring her if I ever was a gainer in life she should not fail to be a
partaker, and promising also to let her know where I settled. I walked
at a great rate, for fear my master's kindness should prompt him to
send after me; and taking the bye-ways, I reached by dark night a
little village, where I resolved to halt. Upon inquiry I found myself
thirty-five miles from my master's. I had eaten nothing all day, and was
very hungry and weary, but my crown-piece was as yet whole; however I
fed very sparingly, being over-pressed with the distress of my affairs
and the confusion of my thoughts. I slept that night tolerably, but the
morning brought its face of horror with it. I had inquired over-night
where I was, and been informed that I was not above sixteen miles from
Bristol, for which place I then resolved.

At my setting out in the morning, after I had walked about three miles,
and had recollected a little my master's last discourse, I found by
degrees my spirit grew calmer than it had been since I left Mr. G. at my
house (as I shall ever call it), and looking into myself for the cause,
found another set of thoughts were preparing a passage into my mind,
which did not carry half the dread and terror with them that their
predecessors had; for I began to cast aside the difficulties and
apprehensions I before felt in my way, and encouraging the present
motions, soon became sensible of the benefit of a virtuous education;
and though what I had hitherto done in the immediate service of God, I
must own had been performed from force, custom, and habit, and without
the least attention to the object of the duty; yet, as under my mother
at home, and my master at the academy, I had been always used to say my
prayers, as they called it, morning and night: I began, with a sort of
superstitious reflection, to accuse myself of having omitted that duty
the night before, and also at my setting out in the morning, and very
much to blame myself for it, and, at the same instant, even wondered at
myself for that blame. What, says I, is the real use of this praying;
and to whom or to what do we pray? I see no one to pray to; neither have
I ever thought that my prayers would be answered. It is true they are
worded as if we prayed to God: but He is in heaven; does He concern
Himself with us who can do Him no service? Can I think all my prayers
that I have said, from day to day, so many years, have been heard by
Him? No, sure; if they had, I should scarce have sustained this hard
fate in my fortune. But hold, how have I prayed to Him? Have I earnestly
prayed to Him, as I used to petition my mother for anything when I
wanted it against her inclination? No, I can't say I have. And would my
mother have granted me such things, if she had not thought I had from my
heart desired them, when I used to be so earnest with her? No, surely; I
can't say she had any reason for it. But I had her indeed before me; now
I have not God in my view: He is in heaven. Yet, let me see; my master
(and I can't help thinking he must know) used to say that God is a
spirit, and not confined by the incumbrance of a body, as we are; now,
if it is so, why may He not virtually be present with me, though I don't
perceive Him? Why may He not be at once in heaven and elsewhere? For if
He consists not in parts, nothing can circumscribe Him: and, truly,
I believe it must be so; for if He is of that supreme power as He is
represented, He could never act in so unconfined a capacity, under
the restraint of place; but if He is an operative and purely spiritual
Being, then I can see no reason why His virtual essence should not
be diffused through all nature; and then (which I begin to think most
likely) why should I not suppose Him ever present with me, and able
to hear me? And why should not I, when I pray, have a full idea of the
Being, though not of any corporeal parts or form of God, and so have
actually somewhat to be intent upon in my prayers, and not do as I have
hitherto done, say so many words only upon my knees; which I cannot help
thinking may be as well without either sense or meaning in themselves,
as without a proper object in my mind to direct them unto?

These thoughts agitated me at least two miles, working stronger and
stronger in me; till at length, bursting into tears, Have I been doing
nothing, says I, in the sight of God, under the name of prayers, for so
many years? Yes, it is certainly so. Well, by the grace of God, it shall
be so no longer; I will try somewhat more. So looking round about me, to
see if I was quite alone, I stepped into an adjoining copse, and could
scarce refrain falling on my knees, till I came to a proper place for
kneeling in. I then poured forth my whole soul and spirit to God; and
all my strength, and every member, every faculty was to the utmost
employed, for a considerable time, in the most agreeable as well as
useful duty. I would indeed have begun with my accustomed prayers, and
had repeated some words of them; when, as though against and contrary to
my design, I was carried away by such rapturous effusions that, to this
hour, when I reflect thereon, I cannot believe but I was moved to them
by a much more than human impulse. However, this ecstasy did not last
above a quarter of an hour; but it was considerably longer before my
spirits subsided to their usual frame. When I had a little composed
myself, how was I altered! how did I condemn myself for all my past
disquiet! what calm thanks did I return for the ease and satisfaction
of mind I then enjoyed! And coming to a small rivulet, I drank a hearty
draught of water and contentedly proceeded on my journey. I reached
Bristol about four o'clock in the afternoon. Having refreshed myself,
I went the same evening to the quay to inquire what ships were in the
river, whither bound, and when they would depart. My business was with
the sailors, of whom there were at that time great numbers there; but I
could meet with no employ, though I gave out I would gladly enter myself
before the mast. After I had done the best I could, but without success,
I returned to the little house I had dined at, and went to bed very
pensive. I did not forget my prayers; but I could by no means be roused
to such devotion as I felt in the morning. Next day I walked again
to the quay, asking all I met, who looked like seafaring men, for
employment; but could hear of none, there being many waiting for berths;
and I feared my appearance (which was not so mean as most of that sort
of gentry is) would prove no small disappointment to my preferment that
way. At last, being out of heart with my frequent repulses, I went to a
landing-place just by, and as I asked some sailors, who were putting two
gentlemen on shore, if they wanted a hand on board their ship, one of
the gentlemen, whom I afterwards found to be the master of a vessel
bound to the coast of Africa, turned back and looking earnestly on me,
"Young man," says he, "do you want employment on board?" I immediately
made him a bow, and answered, "Yes, sir." Said he, "There is no talking
in this weather (for it then blew almost a storm), but step into that
tavern," pointing to the place, "and I will be with you presently." I
went thither, and not long after came my future master. He asked me many
questions, but the first was, whether I had been at sea. I told him no;
but I did not doubt soon to learn the duty of a sailor. He then looked
on my hand, and shaking his head, told me it would not do, for I had too
soft a hand. I told him I was determined for the sea, and that my hand
and heart should go together; and I hoped my hand would soon harden,
though not my heart. He then told me it was a pity to take such a pretty
young fellow before the mast; but if I understood accounts tolerably,
and could write a good hand, he would make me his steward, and make it
worth my while. I answered in the affirmative, joyfully accepting his
offer; but on his asking me where my chest was (for, says he, if the
wind had not been so strong against me, I had fallen down the river
this morning), I looked very blank, and plainly told him I had no other
stores than I carried on my back. The captain smiled. Says he, "Young
man, I see you are a novice; why, the meanest sailor in my ship has a
chest, at least, and perhaps something in it. Come," says he, "my lad,
I like your looks; be diligent and honest; I will let you have a little
money to set you out, and deduct it in your pay." He was then pulling
out his purse, when I begged him, as he seemed to show me so great a
kindness, that he would order somebody to buy what necessaries he knew
I should want for me, or I should be under as great a difficulty to know
what to get, and where to buy them, as I should have been at for want of
them. He commended my prudence, and said he would buy them and send them
on board himself; so bid me trouble myself no more about them, but go to
the ship in the return of his boat, and stay there till he came; giving
me a ticket to the boat's crew to take me in. When I came to the shore,
the boat was gone off and at a good distance; but I hailed them, and
showing my ticket, they put back and took me safe to the ship; heartily
glad that I was entered upon my new service.


CHAPTER V.

     His first entertainment on board--Sets sail--His sickness--
     Engagement with a French privateer--Is taken and laid in
     irons--Twenty-one prisoners turned adrift in a small boat
     with only two days' provision

Being once on board and in pay, I thought I was a man for myself, and
set about considering how to behave; and nobody knowing, as yet, upon
what footing I came on board, they took me for a passenger, as my dress
did not at all bespeak me a sailor; so every one, as I sauntered about,
had something to say to me. By and by comes a pert young fellow up:
"Sir," says he, "your servant; what, I see our captain has picked up a
passenger at last."--"Passenger?" says I; "you are pleased to be
merry, sir; I am no passenger."--"Why, pray," says he, "what may you
be then?"--"Sir," says I, "the captain's steward."--"You impertinent
puppy," says he, "what an answer you give me; you the captain's steward!
No, sir, that place, I can assure you, is in better hands!" and away he
turned. I knew not what to think of it, but was terribly afraid I should
draw myself into some scrape. By and by others asked me, some one thing,
some another, and I was very cautious what answers I made them, for fear
of offence: till a gravish sailor came and sat down by me; and after
talking of the weather and other indifferent matters, "Pray," says I,
"sir, who is that gentleman that was so affronted at me soon after I
came on board?"--"Oh," says he, "a proud, insignificant fellow, the
captain's steward; but don't mind him," says he; "he uses the captain
himself as bad; they have had high words just before the captain went on
shore; and had he used me as he did him, I should have made no ceremony
of tipping him overboard--a rascal!" Says I, "You surprise me; for the
captain sent me on board to be his steward, and agreed with me about it
this afternoon."--"Hush," says he, "I see how it will go; the captain,
if that's the case, will discharge him when he comes on board; and
indeed I believe he would not have kept him so long, but we have waited
for a wind, and he could not provide himself."

The captain came on board at night; and the first thing he did was to
demand the keys of Mr. Steward, which he gave to me, and ordered him on
shore.

The next morning the captain went on shore himself; but the wind
chopping about and standing fair about noon, he returned then with my
chest, and before night we were got into sailing order, and before the
wind with a brisk gale.

What happened the first fourteen days of our passage I know not, having
been all that time so sick and weak I could scarcely keep life and soul
together; but after grew better and better. We prosecuted our voyage,
touching for about a week at the Madeiras in our way. The captain grew
very fond of me, and never put me to hard duty, and I passed my time,
under his favour, very pleasantly. One evening, being within sixty
leagues of the Cape of Palms, calm weather, but the little wind we had
against us, one of our men spied a sail, and gave the captain notice of
it He, not suspecting danger, minded it little, and we made what way the
wind would permit, but night coming on, and the calm continuing, about
peep of day we perceived we were infallibly fallen in with a French
privateer, who, hoisting French colours, called out to us to strike. Our
captain had scarce time to consider what to do, they were so near us;
but as he had twenty-two men on board, and eight guns he could bring
to, he called all hands upon deck, and telling them the consequence of a
surrender, asked them if they would stand by him. One and all swore
they would fight the ship to the bottom, rather than fall into the
privateer's hands. The captain immediately gave the word for a clear
deck, prepared his firearms, and begged them to be active and obey
orders; and perceiving the privateer out-numbered our hands by
abundance, he commanded all the small arms to be brought upon deck
loaded, and to run out as many of the ship's guns as she could bring to
on one side, and to charge them all with small shot, then stand to till
he gave directions. The privateer being a light ship, and a small breeze
arising, run up close to us, first firing one gun, then another, still
calling out to us to strike, but we neither returned fire nor answer,
till he came almost within pistol-shot of us, and seeing us a small
vessel, thought to board us directly; but then our captain ordered a
broadside, and immediately all hands to come on deck; himself standing
there at the time of our first fire with his fusee in his hand, and
near him I stood with another. We killed eight men and wounded several
others. The privateer then fired a broadside through and through us.
By this time our hands were all on deck, and the privateer pushing, in
hopes to grapple and board us, we gave them a volley from thence, that
did good execution; and then all hands to the ship's guns again, except
four, who were left along with me to charge the small arms. It is
incredible how soon they had fired the great guns and were on deck
again. This last fire, being with ball, raked the privateer miserably.
Then we fired the small arms, and away to the ship's guns. This we did
three times successively without loss of a man, and I believe if
we could have held it once more, and no assistance had come to the
privateer, she had sheered quite off: but our captain spying a sail
at some distance behind the privateer, who lay to windward of us, and
seeing by his glass it was a Frenchman, was almost dismayed; the same
sight put courage into our enemies, who thereupon redoubled the attack,
and the first volley of their small arms shot our captain in the breast,
upon which he dropped dead without stirring. I need not say that sight
shocked me exceedingly. Indeed it disconcerted the whole action; and
though our mate, a man of good courage and experience, did all that a
brave man could do to animate the men, they apparently drooped, and
the loss of the ship became inevitable; so we struck, and the Frenchman
boarded us.

During the latter part of the engagement we had two men killed and five
wounded, who died afterwards of their wounds. We, who were alive, were
all ordered on board the Frenchman, who, after rifling us, chained us
two and two and turned us into the hold. Our vessel was then ransacked;
and the other privateer, who had suffered much the day before in an
engagement with an English twenty-gun ship of war, coming up, the prize
was sent by her into port, where she herself was to refit. In this
condition did I and fourteen of our crew lie for six weeks, till the
fetters on our legs had almost eaten to the bone, and the stench of the
place had well-nigh suffocated us.

The "Glorieux" (for that was the name of the privateer who took us)
saw nothing farther in five weeks worth her notice, which very much
discouraged the men; and consulting together, it was agreed to cruise
more northward, between Sierra Leone and Cape de Verde; but about noon
next day they spied a sail coming west-north-west with a fresh gale.
The captain thereupon ordered all to be ready, and lie by for her. But
though she discerned us, she kept her way, bearing only more southward;
when the wind shifting to northeast, she ran for it, full before the
wind, and we after her, with all the sail we could crowd; and though
she was a very good sailer, we gained upon her, being laden, and before
night came pretty well up with her; but being a large ship, and the
evening hazy, we did not choose to engage her till morning. The next
morning we found she was slunk away; but we fetched her up, and hoisting
French colours, fired a shot, which she not answering, our captain run
alongside of her and fired a broadside; then slackening upon her, a
hard engagement ensued; the shot thumping so against our ship, that we
prisoners, who had nothing to do in the action, expected death, one or
other of us, every moment. The merchantman was so heavy loaded, and drew
so much water, that she was very unwieldy in action; so after a fight of
two hours, when most of her rigging and masts were cut and wounded, she
struck. Twelve men were sent on board her, and her captain and several
officers were ordered on board us.

There were thirty-eight persons in her, including passengers; all of
whom, except five, and the like number which had been killed in the
action, were sent chained into the hold to us, who had lain there almost
six weeks. This prize put Monsieur into good heart, and determined him
to return home with her. But in two days' time his new acquisition was
found to have leaked so fast near the bottom, that before they were
aware of it the water was risen some feet. Several hands were employed
to find out the leak; but all asserted it was too low to be come at; and
as the pumps, with all the labour the prisoners, who were the persons
put to it, could use, would not reduce it, but it still increased, they
removed what goods they could into the privateer; and before they could
unload it the prize sunk.

The next thing they consulted upon was what to do with the prisoners,
who, by the loss of the prize, were now grown too numerous to be trusted
in the privateer; fearing, too, as they were now so far out at sea,
by the great addition of mouths, they might soon be brought to short.
allowance, it was, on both accounts, resolved to give us the prize's
boat, which they had saved, and turn us adrift to shift for ourselves.
There were in all forty-three of us; but the privateer having lost
several of their own men in the two engagements, they looked us over,
and picking out two-and-twenty of us, who were the most likely fellows
for their purpose, the remaining one-and-twenty were committed to the
boat, with about two days' provision and a small matter of ammunition,
and turned out.


CHAPTER VI.

     The boat, two hundred leagues from land, makes no way, but
     drives more to sea by the wind--The people live nine days at
     quarter allowance--Four die with hunger the twelfth day--
     Five more the fourteenth day--On the fifteenth they eat one
     just dead--Want of water excessive--Spy a sail--Are taken up
     --Work their passage to the African shore--Are sent on a
     secret expedition--Are waylaid, taken slaves, and sent up
     the country.

When we, who were in the boat, came to reflect on our condition, the
prospect before us appeared very melancholy; though we had at first
readily enough embraced the offer, rather than perish in so much misery
as we suffered in our loathsome confinement. We now judged we were above
two hundred leagues from land, in about eight degrees north latitude;
and it blowing north-east, a pretty stiff gale, we could make no way,
but rather lost, for we aimed at some port in Africa, having neither
sail, compass, nor any other instrument to direct us; so that all the
observation we could make was by the sun for running southward, or as
the wind carried us, for we had lost the North Pole. As we had little
above two days' provisions, we perceived a necessity of almost starving
voluntarily, to avoid doing it quite, seeing it must be many days before
we could reach shore, if ever we did, having visibly driven a great deal
more southward than we were; nay, unless a sudden change happened, we
were sure of perishing, unless delivered by some ship that Providence
might send in our way. In short, the ninth day came, but no relief with
it; and though we had lived at quarter allowance, and but just saved
life, our food, except a little water, was all gone, and this caused
us quite to despair. On the twelfth day four of our company died with
hunger in a very miserable way; and yet the survivors had not strength
left to move them to pity their fellows. In truth, we had sat still,
attempting nothing in several days; as we found that, unless the wind
shifted, we only consumed the little strength we had left to no manner
of purpose. On the fourteenth day, and in the night, five more died, and
a sixth was near expiring; and yet we, the survivors, were so indolent,
we would scarce lend a hand to throw them overboard. On the fifteenth
day, in the morning, our carpenter, weak as he was, started up, and as
the sixth man was just dead, cut his throat, and whilst warm let out
what blood would flow; then pulling off his old jacket, invited us to
dinner, and cutting a large slice of the corpse, devoured it with as
much seeming relish as if it had been ox-beef. His example prevailed
with the rest of us, one after another, to taste and eat; and as
there had been a heavy dew or rain in the night, and we had spread out
everything we had of linen and woollen to receive it, we were a little
refreshed by wringing our clothes and sipping what came from them; after
which we covered them up from the sun, stowing them all close together
to keep in the moisture, which served us to suck at for two days after,
a little and a little at a time; for now we were in greater distress for
water than for meat. It has surprised me, many times since, to think how
we could make so light a thing of eating our fellow creature just dead
before our eyes; but I will assure you, when we had once tasted, we
looked on the blessing to be so great, that we cut and eat with as
little remorse as we should have had for feeding on the best meat in
an English market; and most certainly, when this corpse had failed,
if another had not dropped by fair means, we should have used foul by
murdering one of our number as a supply for the rest.

Water, as I said before, to moisten our mouths, was now our greatest
hardship, for every man had so often drank his own, that we voided
scarce anything but blood, and that but a few drops at a time; our
mouths and tongues were quite flayed with drought, and our teeth just
fallen from our jaws; for though we had tried, by placing all the
dead men's jackets and shirts one over another, to strain some of the
sea-water through them by small quantities, yet that would not deprive
it of its pernicious qualities; and though it refreshed a little in
going down, we were so sick, and strained ourselves so much after it,
that it came up again, and made us more miserable than before. Our
corpse now stunk so, what was left of it, that we could no longer bear
it on board, and every man began to look with an evil eye on his fellow,
to think whose turn it would be next; for the carpenter had started the
question, and preached us into the necessity of it; and we had agreed,
the next morning, to put it to the lot who should be the sacrifice. In
this distress of thought it was so ordered by good Providence, that
on the twenty-first day we thought we spied a sail coming from the
north-west, which caused us to delay our lots till we should see whether
it would discover us or not: we hung up some jackets upon our oars, to
be seen as far off as we could, but had so little strength left we could
make no way towards it; however, it happened to direct its course so
much to our relief, that an hour before sunset it was within a league
of us, but seemed to bear away more eastward, and our fear was that they
should not know our distress, for we were not able to make any noise
from our throats that might be heard fifty yards; but the carpenter, who
was still the best man amongst us, with much ado getting one of the guns
to go off, in less than half-an-hour she came up with us, and seeing
our deplorable condition, took us all on board, to the number of eleven.
Though no methods were un-essayed for our recovery, four more of us
died in as many days. When the remaining seven of us came a little to
ourselves, we found our deliverers were Portuguese, bound for Saint
Salvadore. We told the captain we begged he would let us work our
passage with him, be it where it would, to shore; and then, if we could
be of no further service to him, we did not doubt getting into Europe
again: but in the voyage, as we did him all the service in our power, we
pleased him so well that he engaged us to stay with him to work the ship
home again, he having lost some hands by fever soon after his setting
sail.

We arrived safe in port; and in a few days the captain, who had a secret
enterprise to take in hand, hired a country coasting vessel, and sent
her seventeen leagues farther on the coast for orders from some factory
or settlement there. I was one of the nine men who were destined to
conduct her; but not understanding Portuguese, I knew little of the
business we went upon. We were to coast it all the way; but on the tenth
day, just at sunrise, we fell in with a fleet of boats which had waylaid
us, and were taken prisoners. Being carried ashore, we were conducted a
long way up the country, where we were imprisoned, and almost starved,
though I never knew the meaning of it; nor did any of us, unless the
mate, who, we heard, was carried up the country much farther, to Angola;
but we never heard more of him, though we were told he would be sent
back to us.

Here we remained under confinement almost three months, at the end of
which time our keeper told us we were to be removed; and coupling us two
and two together, sent a guard with us to Angola; when, crossing a
large river, we were set to work in removing the rubbish and stones of
a castle or fortress, which had been lately demolished by an earthquake
and lightning. Here we continued about five months, being very sparingly
dieted, and locked up every night.

This place, however, I thought a paradise to our former dungeon; and as
we were not overworked, we made our lives comfortable enough, having the
air all day to refresh us from the heat, and not wanting for company;
for there were at least three hundred of us about the whole work; and
I often fancied myself at the tower of Babel, each labourer almost
speaking in a language of his own.

Towards the latter end of our work our keepers grew more and more remiss
in their care of us. At my first coming thither, I had contracted a
familiarity with one of the natives, but of a different kingdom, who was
then a slave with me; and he and I being able tolerably to understand
each other, he hinted to me, one day, the desire he had of seeing his
own country and family, who neither knew whether he was dead or alive,
or where he was, since he had left them, seven years before, to make war
in this kingdom; and insinuated that as he had taken a great liking to
me, if I would endeavour to escape with him, and we succeeded, he would
provide for me. "For," says he, "you see, now our work is almost over,
we are but slightly guarded; and if we stay till this job is once
finished, we may be commanded to some new works at the other end of the
kingdom, for aught we know, so that our labours will only cease with our
lives: and for my part, immediate death in the attempt of liberty is to
me preferable to a lingering life of slavery."

These, and such-like arguments, prevailed on me to accompany him, as he
had told me he had travelled most of the country before in the wars of
the different nations; so having taken our resolution, the following
evening, soon after our day's work, and before the time came for locking
up, we withdrew from the rest, but within hearing, thinking if we should
then be missed and called, we would appear and make some excuse for our
absence, but if not, we should have the whole night before us.

When we were first put upon this work, we were called over singly, by
name, morning and evening, to be let out and in, and were very narrowly
observed in our motions; but not one of us having been ever absent, our
actions were at length much less minded than before, and the ceremony of
calling us over was frequently omitted; so that we concluded if we
got away unobserved the first night, we should be out of the reach of
pursuers by the next; which was the soonest it was possible for them to
overtake us, as we proposed to travel the first part of our journey with
the utmost despatch.

     whelps--Arrive at Glanlepzis house--The trial of Glanlepze's
     wife's constancy--The tender meeting of her and her
     husband--The author's reflections thereupon.

Having now set out with all possible speed, we seemed to each other as
joyful as we could; though it cannot be supposed we had no fears in our
minds the first part of our journey, for we had many; but as our way
advanced our fears subsided; and having, with scarce any delay, pushed
forwards for the first twenty-four hours, nature then began to have two
very pressing demands upon us, food and rest; but as one of them was
absolutely out of our power to comply with, she contented herself
with the other till we should be better able to supply her, and gave a
farther time till the next day.

The next morning found us very empty and sharp-set, though a very sound
night's rest had contributed its utmost to refresh us. But what added
much to our discomfort was, that though our whole subsistence must come
from fruits, there was not a tree to be found at a less distance than
twelve leagues, in the open rocky country we were then in; but a good
draught of excellent water we met with did us extraordinary service, and
sent us with much better courage to the woods, though they were quite
out of the way of our route: there, by divers kinds of fruits, which,
though my companion knew very well, I was quite a stranger to, we
satisfied our hunger for the present, and took a moderate supply for
another opportunity. This retarded our journey very much, for in so hard
travel every pound weighed six before night.

I cannot say this journey, though bad enough, would have been so
discouraging, but for the trouble of fetching our provisions so far; and
then, if we meant not to lose half the next day in the same manner, we
must double load ourselves, and delay our progress by that means; but we
still went on, and in about eight days got quite clear of Angola.

On the eighth day, my companion, whose name was Glanlepze, told me we
were very near the confines of Congo, but there was one little village
still in Angola by which we must pass within half a league; and if I
would agree to it, he would go see what might be got here to supply
ourselves with. I told him I was in an unknown world, and would follow
wherever he should lead me; but asked him if he was not afraid of the
people, as he was not of that country. He told me as there had been wars
between them and his country for assisting their neighbours of Congo,
he was not concerned for any mischief he should do them, or they him.
"But," says he, "you have a knife in your pocket, and with that we will
cut two stout clubs, and then follow me and fear nothing."

We soon cut our clubs, and marching on, in the midst of some small
shrubs and a few scattering trees, we saw a little hovel, larger indeed,
but worse contrived, than an English hog-stye, to which we boldly
advanced; and Glanlepze entering first, saluted an old man who was lying
on a parcel of rushes. The man attempted to run away, but Glanlepze
stopped him, and we tied his hands and feet He then set up such a
hideous howl, that had not Glanlepze threatened to murder him, and
prepared to do it, he would have raised the whole village upon us;
but we quieted him, and rummaging to find provision, which was all we
wanted, we by good luck spied best part of a goat hanging up behind a
large mat at the farther end of the room. By this time in comes a woman
with two children, very small. This was the old man's daughter, of about
five-and-twenty. Glanlepze bound her also, and laid her by the old man;
but the two children we suffered to lie untied. We then examined her,
who told us the old man was her father, and that her husband, having
killed a goat that morning, was gone to carry part of it to his sister;
that they had little or no corn; and finding we wanted victuals, she
told us there was an earthen pot we might boil some of the goat in if we
pleased.

Having now seen all that was to be had, we were going to make up our
bundle, when a muletto very gently put his head into the doorway: him
Glanlepze immediately seized; and bidding me fetch the great mat and the
goat's flesh, he in the meantime put a long rope he found there about
the beast's neck, and laying the mat upon him, we packed up the goat's
flesh and a little corn in a calabash-shell; and then turning up the mat
round about, skewered it together, and over all we tied the earthen pot;
Glanlepze crying out at everything we loaded, "It is no hurt to plunder
an enemy!" and so we marched off.

I own I had greater apprehensions from this adventure than from anything
before. "For," says I, "if the woman's husband returns soon, or if she
or her father can release themselves, they will raise the whole village
upon us, and we are undone." But Glanlepze laughed at me, saying we had
not an hour's walk out of the Angola dominions, and that the king of
Congo was at war with them in helping the king of Loango, whose subject
himself was; and that the Angolans durst not be seen out of their
bounds on that side the kingdom; for there was a much larger village
of Congovians in our way, who would certainly rise and destroy them, if
they came in any numbers amongst them; and though the war being carried
on near the sea, the borders were quiet, yet, upon the least stir, the
whole country would be in arms, whilst we might retire through the woods
very safely.

Well, we marched on as fast as we could all the remainder of that day
till moonlight, close by the skirt of a long wood, that we might take
shelter therein, if there should be occasion $ and my eyes were the best
part of the way behind me; but neither hearing nor seeing anything to
annoy us, and finding by the declivity of the ground we should soon
be in some plain or bottom, and have a chance of water for us all, and
pasture for our muletto, which was now become one of us, we would not
halt till we found a bottom to the hill, which in half an hour more we
came to, and in some minutes after to a rivulet of fine clear water,
where we resolved to spend the night. Here we fastened our muletto
by his cord to a stake in the ground; but perceiving him not to
have sufficient range to fill his belly in before morning, we, under
Glanlepze's direction, cut several long slips from the mat, and soaking
them well in water, twisted them into a very strong cord, of sufficient
length for the purpose. And now, having each of us brought a bundle
of dry fallen sticks from the wood with us, and gathered two or three
flints as we came along, we struck fire on my knife upon some rotten
wood, and boiled a good piece of our goat's flesh; and having made such
a meal as we had neither of us made for many months before, we laid us
down and slept heartily till morning.

As soon as day broke we packed up our goods, and filling our calabash
with water, we loaded our muletto, and got forward very pleasantly that
day and several others following, and had tolerable lodgings.

About noon, one day, travelling with great glee, we met an adventure
which very much daunted me, and had almost put a stop to my hopes of
ever getting where I intended. We came to a great river whose name I
have now forgot, near a league over, but full, and especially about
the shores, of large trees that had fallen from the mountains and been
rolled down with the floods, and lodged there in a shocking manner. This
river, Glanlepze told me, we must pass: for my part, I shrunk at the
sight of it, and told him if he could get over, I would not desire to
prevent his meeting with his family; but as for my share, I had rather
take my chance in the woods on this side than plunge myself into such
a stream only for the sake of drowning. "Oh!" says Glanlepze, "then you
can't swim?"--"No," says I; "there's my misfortune."--"Well," says the
kind Glanlepze, "be of good heart; I'll have you over." He then bade me
go cut an armful of the tallest of the reeds that grew there near the
shore, whilst he pulled up another where he then was, and bring them to
him. The side of the river sloped for a good way with an easy descent,
so that it was very shallow where the reeds grew, and they stood very
close together upon a large compass of ground. I had no sooner entered
the reeds a few yards, to cut some of the longest, but (being about
knee-deep in the water and mud, and every step raising my feet very high
to keep them clear of the roots, which were matted together) I thought
I had trod upon a trunk of one of the trees, of which, as I said, there
was such plenty thereabouts; and raising my other foot to get that also
upon the tree, as I fancied it, I found it move along with me; upon
which I roared out, when Glanlepze, who was not far from me, imagining
what was the matter, cried out, "Leap off, and run to shore to the
right!" I knew not yet what was the case, but did what I was bid, and
gained the shore. Looking back, I perceived the reeds shake and
rustle all the way to the shore, by degrees after me. I was terribly
frightened, and ran to Glanlepze, who then told me the danger I had
escaped, and that what I took for a tree was certainly a large alligator
or crocodile.

My blood ran chill within me at hearing the name of such a dangerous
creature; but he had no sooner told me what it was, than out came
the most hideous monster I had ever seen. Glanlepze ran to secure the
muletto; and then taking the cord which had fastened him, and tying it
to each end of a broken arm of a tree that lay on the shore, he marched
up to the crocodile without the least dismay, and beginning near the
tail, with one leg on one side, and the other on the other side, he
straddled over him, still mending his pace as the beast crept forward,
till he came to his fore-feet; then throwing the great log before his
mouth, he, by the cord in his hand, bobbed it against the creature's
nose, till he gaped wide enough to have taken in the muletto; then of
a sudden, jerking the wood between his jaws with all his force by the
cord, he gagged the beast, with his jaws wide open up to his throat, so
that he could neither make use of his teeth nor shut his mouth; he then
threw one, end of the cord upon the ground, just before the creature's
under-jaw, which, as he by degrees crept along over it, came out behind
his fore-legs on the contrary side; and serving the other end of it in
the same manner, he took up those ends and tied them over the creature's
back, just within his forelegs, which kept the gag firm in his mouth;
and then calling out to me (for I stood at a good distance), "Peter,"
says he, "bring me your knife!" I trembled at going so near, for the
crocodile was turning his head this way and that very uneasy, and
wanting to get to the river again, but yet I carried it, keeping as
much behind him as I could, still eyeing him which way he moved, and at
length tossed my knife so near that Glanlepze could reach it; and he,
just keeping behind the beast's forefeet, and leaning forward, first
darted the knife into one eye, and then into the other; and immediately
leaping from his back, came running to me. "So, Peter," says he, "I have
done the business."--"Aye! business enough, I think," says I, "and more
than I would have done to have been king of Congo."--"Why, Peter," says
he, "there is nothing but a man may compass by resolution, if he takes
both ends of a thing in his view at once, and fairly deliberates on both
sides what may be given and taken from end to end. What you have seen
me perform is only from a thorough notion I have of this beast and of
myself, how far each of us hath power to act and counteract upon the
other, and duly applying the means. But,", says he, "this talk will not
carry us across the river; come, here are the reeds I have pulled up,
which I believe will be sufficient without any more, for I would
not overload the muletto."--"Why," says I, "is the muletto to carry
them?"--"No, they are to carry you," says he.--"I can never ride upon
these," says I.--"Hush!" says he, "I'll not lose you, never fear. Come,
cut me a good tough stick, the length of these reeds."--"Well," says I,
"this is all conjuration; but I don't see a step towards my getting over
the river yet, unless I am to ride the muletto upon these reeds, and
guide myself with the stick."

"I must own, Peter," says he, "you have a bright guess." So taking an
armful of the reeds, and laying them on the ground, "Now, Peter," says
he, "lay that stick upon those reeds and tie them tight at both ends."
I did so. "Now, Peter," says he, "lay yourself down upon them." I then
laying myself on my back, lengthwise, upon the reeds, Glanlepze laughed
heartily at me, and turning me about, brought my breast upon the reeds
at the height of my arm-pits; and then taking a handful of the reeds he
had reserved by themselves, he laid them on my back, tying them to the
bundle close at my shoulders, and again at the ends. "Now, Peter," says
he, "stand up;" which I did, but it was full as much as I could do. I
then seeing Glanlepze laughing at the figure I cut, desired him to be
serious, and not put me upon losing my life for a joke; for I could not
think what he would do next with me. He bid me never fear; and looking
more soberly, ordered me to walk to the river, and so stand just within
the bank till he came; then leading the muletto to me, he tied me to
her, about a yard from the tail, and taking the cord in his hand, led
the muletto and me into the water. We had not gone far before my guide
began to swim, then the muletto and I were presently chin-deep, and I
expected nothing but drowning every moment: however, having gone so far,
I was ashamed to cry out; when getting out of my depth, and my reeds
coming to their bearing, up I mounted, and was carried on with all
the ease imaginable; my conductor guiding us between the trees so
dexterously, that not one accident happened to either of us all the way,
and we arrived safe on the opposite shore.

We had now got into a very low, close, swampy country, and our goat's
flesh began to be very stale through the heat, not only of the sun, but
the muletto's back: however, we pleased ourselves we should have one
more meal of it before it was too bad to eat; so, having travelled about
three miles from the river, we took up our lodging on a little rising,
and tied our muletto in a valley about half a furlong below us, where he
made as good a meal in his way as we did in ours.

We had but just supped, and were sauntering about to find the easiest
spot to sleep on, when we heard a rustling and a grumbling noise in a
small thicket just on our right, which seeming to approach nearer and
nearer, Glanlepze roused himself, and was on his legs just time enough
to see a lioness and a small whelp which accompanied her, within thirty
yards of us, making towards us, as we afterwards guessed, for the sake
of our goat's flesh, which now smelt very strong. Glanlepze whipped on
the contrary side of the fire to that where the goat's flesh lay, and
fell to kicking the fire about at a great rate, which being made of dry
wood, caused innumerable sparks to fly about us; but the beasts still
approaching in a couchant manner, and seizing the ribs of the goat
and other bones (for we had only cut the flesh off), and grumbling and
cracking them like rotten twigs, Glanlepze snatched up a fire-brand,
flaming, in each hand, and made towards them; which sight so terrified
the creatures that they fled with great precipitation to the thicket
again.

Glanlepze was a little uneasy at the thoughts of quitting so good a
lodging as we had found, but yet held it best to move farther; for as
the lions had left the bones behind them, we must expect another visit
if we stayed there, and could hope for no rest; and, above all, we might
possibly lose our muletto; so we removed our quarters two miles farther,
where we slept with great tranquillity.

Reflections on the nature of mankind have often astonished me. I told
you at first my thoughts concerning prayer in my journey to Bristol, and
of the benefit I received from it, and how fully I was convinced of
the necessity of it; which one would think was a sufficient motive to a
reasonable creature to be constant in it; and yet, it is too true that,
notwithstanding the difficulties I had laboured under, and hardships I
had undergone, and the danger of starving at sea or being murdered for
food by my fellows, when there was as urgent a necessity of begging
Divine assistance as can be conceived, I never once thought of it, nor
of the Object of it, nor returned thanks for my being delivered, till
the lioness had just left me; and then I felt near the same force urging
me to return thanks for my escape, as I had impelling me to prayer
before; and I think I did so with great sincerity.

I shall not trouble you with a relation of the common accidents of our
journey, which lasted two months and better, nor with the different
methods we used to get subsistence, but shall at once conduct you to
Quamis; only mentioning that we were sometimes obliged to go about, and
were once stopped by a cut that my guide and companion received by a
ragged stone in his foot, which growing very bad, almost deprived me of
the hopes of his life; but by rest and constant sucking and licking it,
which was the only remedy we had to apply, except green leaves chewed,
that I laid to it by his direction, to supple and cool it, he soon began
to be able to ride upon the muletto, and sometimes to walk a little.

I say we arrived at Quamis, a small place on a river of that name, where
Glanlepze had a neat dwelling, and left a wife and five children when
he went out to the wars. We were very near the town when the day closed;
and as it is soon dark there after sunset, you could but just see
your hand at our entrance into it We met nobody in the way, but I went
directly to Glanlepze's door, by his direction, and struck two or three
strokes hard against it with my stick. On this there came a woman to
it stark-naked. I asked her, in her own language, if she knew one
Glanlepze. She told me, with a deep sigh, that once she did. I asked
then where he was. She said, with their ancestors, she hoped, for he
was the greatest warrior in the world; but if he was not dead, he was
in slavery. Now you must know Glanlepze had a mind to hear how his wife
took his death or slavery, and had put me upon asking these questions
before he discovered himself. I proceeded then to tell her I brought
some news of Glanlepze, and was lately come from him, and by his order.
"And does my dear Glanlepze live!" says she, flying upon my neck, and
almost smothering me with caresses, till I begged her to forbear, or she
would strangle me, and I had a great deal more to tell her; then ringing
for a light, when she saw I was a white man she seemed in the utmost
confusion at her own nakedness; and immediately retiring, she threw a
cloth round her waist and came to me again. I then repeated to her that
her husband was alive and well, but wanted a ransom to redeem himself,
and had sent me to see what she could anyways raise for that purpose.
She told me she and her children had lived very hardly ever since he
went from her, and she had nothing to sell, or make money of, but her
five children; that as this was the time for the slaving-trade, she
would see what she could raise by them, and if that would not do, she
would sell herself and send him the money, if he would let her know how
to do it.

Glanlepze, who heard every word that passed, finding so strong a proof
of his wife's affection, could hold out no longer, but bursting into the
room, clasped her in his arms, crying, "No, Zulika! (for that was
her name) I am free; there will be no occasion for your or my dear
children's slavery, and rather than have purchased my freedom at that
rate, I would willingly have died a slave myself. But my own ears have
heard the tender sentiments my Zulika has for me." Then, drowned in
tears of joy, they embraced each other so close and so long, that I
thought it impertinent to be seen with them till their first transports
were over. So I retired without the house, till Glanlepze called me in,
which was not less than full half an hour. I admired at the love and
constancy of the person I had just left behind me; and, Good Heaven,
thinks I to myself, with a sigh, how happy has this our escape rendered
Glanlepze and his wife! what a mutual felicity do they feel! And what
is the cause of all this? Is it that he has brought home great treasures
from the wars? Nothing like it; he is come naked. Is it that, having
escaped slavery and poverty, he is returned to an opulent wife,
abounding with the good things of life? No such thing. What, then, can
be the cause of this excess of satisfaction, this alternate joy, that
Patty and I could not have been as happy with each other? Why, it was my
pride that interposed and prevented it. But what am I like to get by
it, and by all this travel and these hazards? Is this the way to make
a fortune, to get an estate? No, surely the very contrary. I could not,
forsooth, labour for Patty and her children where I was known; but am I
any better for labouring here where I am not known, where I have nobody
to assist me, than I could have been where I am known, and where there
would have been my friends about me, at least, if they could have
afforded no great assistance? I have been deceived, then, and have
travelled so many thousand miles, and undergone so many dangers, only to
know at last I had been happier at home; and have doubled my misery for
want of consideration--that very consideration which, impartially
taken, would have convinced me I ought to have made the best of my bad
circumstances, and to have laid hold of every commendable method of
improving them. Did I come hither to avoid daily labour or voluntary
servitude at home? I have had it in abundance. Did I come hither to
avoid poverty or contempt? Here I have met with them tenfold And now,
after all, was I to return home empty and naked, as Glanlepze has done,
should I meet a wife, as bare as myself, so ready to die in my embraces,
and to be a slave herself, with her children, for my sake only? I fear
not.

These and the like reflections had taken possession of me when Glanlepze
called me in; where I found his wife, in her manner, preparing our
supper, with all that cheerfulness which gives a true lustre to
innocence.

The bustle we made had by this time awakened the children; who,
stark-naked as they were born, both boys and girls, came crawling out,
black as jet, from behind a curtain at the farther end of the room,
which was very long. The father as yet had only inquired after them;
but upon sight of them he fell into an ecstasy, kissing one, stroking
another, dandling a third, for the eldest was scarce fourteen; but
not one of them knew him, for seven years makes a great chasm in young
memories. The more I saw of this sport, the stronger impression Patty
and my own children made upon me. My mind had been so much employed on
my own distresses, that those dear ideas were almost effaced; but this
moving scene introduced them afresh, and imprinted them deeply on my
imagination, which cherished the sweet remembrance.

     acquaintance with some English prisoners--They project an
     escape--He joins them--They seize a Portuguese ship and get
     off.--Make a long run from land--Want water--They anchor at

     The author's miserable condition

I passed my time with Glanlepze and his wife, who both really loved
me, with sufficient bodily quiet, for about two years: my business
was chiefly, in company with my patron, to cultivate a spot of ground
wherein we had planted grain and necessaries for the family; and once or
twice a week we went a fishing, and sometimes hunted and shot venison.
These were our chief employments; for as to excursions for slaves, which
is a practice in many of those countries, and what the natives get money
by, since our own slavery, Glanlepze and I could not endure it.

Though I was tolerably easy in my external circumstances, yet my mind
hankering after England made my life still: unhappy; and that infelicity
daily increased as I saw the less probability of attaining my desire. At
length, hearing of some European sailors who were under confinement for
contraband trade at a Portuguese fort about two miles from Quamis, I
resolved to go to see them; and if any of them should be English, at
least to inquire after my native country. I went and found two Dutchmen
who had been sailors in British pay several years, three Scotchmen,
an Irishman, and five Englishmen, but all had been long in English
merchants' service. They were taken, as they told me, by a Portuguese
vessel, together with their ship, as a Dutch prize under pretence of
contraband trade. The captain was known to be a Dutchman, though he
spoke good English, and was then in English pay and his vessel English;
therefore they would have it that he was a Dutch trader, and so seized
his ship in the harbour, with the prisoners in it The captain, who was
on shore with several of his men, was threatened to be laid in irons if
he was taken, which obliged him and his men to abscond, and fly overland
to an English factory for assistance to recover his ship and cargo;
being afraid to appear and claim it amongst so many enemies without an
additional force. They had been in confinement two months, and their
ship confiscated and sold. In this miserable condition I left them, but
returned once or twice a week for a fortnight or three weeks to visit
them. These instances of regard, as they thought them, created some
confidence in me, so that they conversed with me very freely. Amongst
other discourse, they told me one day that one of their crew who went
with the captain had been taken ill on the way, and being unable to
proceed, was returned; but as he talked good Portuguese, he was not
suspected to belong to them; and that he had been to visit them, and
would be there again that day. I had a mind to see him, so stayed longer
than I intended, and in about an hour's time he came. After he was
seated he asked who I was, and (privately) if I might be trusted. Being
satisfied I might, for that I was a Cornish man, he began as follows,
looking narrowly about to see he was not overheard: "My lads," says he,
"be of good courage; I have hopes for you; be but men and we shall see
better days yet." I wondered to what this preface tended, when he told
us that since his return from the captain, as he spoke good Portuguese
and had sailed on board Portuguese traders several years, he mixed among
that people, and particularly among the crew of the "Del Cruz," the ship
which had taken them; that that ship had partly unloaded, and was taking
in other goods for a future voyage; that he had informed himself of
their strength, and that very seldom more than three men and two boys
lay on board; that he had hired himself to the captain, and was to go
on board the very next day. "Now," says he, "my lads, if you can break
prison any night after to-morrow, and come directly to the ship (telling
them how she lay, for, says he, you cannot mistake, you will find two
or three boats moored in the gut against the church), I will be ready to
receive you, and we will get off with her in lieu of our ship they have
taken from us, for there is nothing ready to follow us."

The prisoners listened to this discourse very attentively; but scratched
their heads, fearing the difficulty of it, and severer usage if they
miscarried, and made several objections; but at last they all swore to
attempt it the night but one following. Upon which the sailor went away
to prepare for their reception on board. After he was gone, I surveyed
his scheme attentively in my own mind, and found it not so difficult as
I first imagined, if the prisoners could but escape cleverly. So before
I went away I told them I approved of their purpose; and as I was their
countryman, I was resolved, with their leaves, to risk my fortune with
them. At this they seemed much pleased, and all embraced me. We then
fixed the peremptory night, and I was to wait at the water-side and get
the boats in readiness.

The prison they were in was a Portuguese fort, which had been deserted
ever since the building a much better on the other side of the river, a
gunshot lower. It was built with walls too thick for naked men to storm;
the captives were securely locked up every night; and two soldiers,
or sentinels, kept watch in an outer-room, who were relieved from the
main-guard in the body of the building.

The expected night arrived, and a little before midnight, as had been
concerted, one of the prisoners cried out he was so parched up he was on
fire, he was on fire! The sentinels were both asleep, but the first that
waked called at the door to know what was the matter. The prisoner still
crying out, "I am on fire!" the rest begged the sentinel to bring a bowl
of water for him, for they knew not what ailed him.

The good-natured fellow, without waking his companion, brought the
water, and having a lamp in the guard-room, opened the door; when the
prisoners seizing his arms, and commanding him to silence, bound his
hands behind him, and his feet together; then serving the other in the
same manner, who was now just awake, and taking from them their swords
and muskets, they made the best of their way over the fort wall; which
being built with buttresses on the inside was easily surmounted. Being
got out, they were not long in finding me, who had before this time made
the boats ready and was impatiently waiting for them; so in we all got
and made good speed to the ship, where we were welcomed by our companion
ready to receive us.

Under pretence of being a new-entered sailor, he had carried some
Madeira wine on board, and treated the men and boys so freely that he
had thrown them into a dead sleep, which was a wise precaution. There
being now, therefore, no fear of disturbance or interruption, we drew up
the two boats and set all hands at work to put the ship under way; and
plied it so closely, the wind favouring us, that by eleven o'clock the
next morning we were out of sight of land; but we set the men and boys
adrift, in one of the boats, nigh the mouth of the river.

The first thing we did after we had made a long run from shore was to
consult what course to steer. Now, as there was a valuable loading on
board of goods from Portugal and others taken in since, some gave their
opinion for sailing directly for India, selling the ship and cargo there
and returning by some English vessel; but that was rejected; for we did
not doubt but notice would be given of our escape along the coast, and
if we should fall into the Portuguese's hands, we could expect no mercy;
besides, we had not people sufficient for such an enterprise. Others,
again, were for sailing the directest course for England; but I told
them, as our opinions were different, and no time was to be lost, my
advice was to stretch southward till we might be quite out of fear of
pursuit, and then, whatever course we took, by keeping clear of all
coasts, we might hope to come safe off.

My proposal seemed to please the whole crew; so crowding all the sail
we could, we pushed southwards very briskly before the wind for several
days. We now went upon examining our stores, and found we had flour
enough, plenty of fish and salt provisions, but were scant of water and
wood; of the first whereof there was not half a ton, and but very little
of the latter. This made us very uneasy, and being none of us expert in
navigation farther than the common working of the ship, and having no
chart on board that might direct us to the nearest land, we were almost
at our wits' end, and came to a short allowance of liquor. That we must
get water if we could was indisputable; but where to do it puzzled us,
as we had determined not to get in with the African shore on any account
whatever.

In this perplexity, and under the guidance of different opinions (for
we were all captains now), we sometimes steered eastward, and sometimes
westward, for about nine days, when we espied a little bluish cloud-like
appearance to the southwest; this continuing, we hoped it might be land,
and therefore made to it. Upon our nearer approach we found it to be,
as we judged, an island; but not knowing its name or whether it was
inhabited, we coasted round it two days to satisfy ourselves as to this
last particular. Seeing no living creature on it during that time, and
the shore being very broken, we came to an anchor about two miles from
it, and sent ten of our crew in our best boat with some casks to get
water and cut wood. The boat returned at night with six men and the
casks filled, having left four behind to go on with the cutting of wood
against next day. Accordingly next morning the boat went off again and
made two turns with water and wood ere night, which was repeated for two
or three days after. On the sixth she went off for wood only, leaving
none but me and one John Adams on board.

The boat had scarce reached the island this last turn before the day
overcast, and there arose such a storm of wind, thunder, lightning, and
hail as I had never before seen. At last our cable broke close to the
anchor, and away we went with the wind full southward by west; and not
having strength to keep the ship upon a side wind, we were forced to set
her head right before it and let her drive. Our hope was, every hour,
the storm would abate; but it continued with equal violence for many
days, during all which time neither Adams nor I had any rest, for one or
other of us was forced, and sometimes both, to keep her right before the
wind, or she would certainly have overset. When the storm abated, as it
did by degrees, neither Adams nor I could tell where we were, or in what
part of the world.

I was sorry I had no better a sailor with me, for neither Adams nor
myself had ever made more than one voyage till now, so that we were both
unacquainted with the latitude, and scarce knew the use of the compass
to any purpose; and being out of all hope of ever reaching the island to
our companions, we neither knew which way to steer, nor what to do; and
indeed had we known where we were, we two only could not have been
able to navigate the ship to any part we desired, or ever to get to the
island, unless such a wind as we had before would of itself have driven
us thither.

Whilst we were considering, day after day, what to do, though the sea
was now very calm and smooth, the ship seemed to sail at as great a rate
as before, which we attributed to the velocity she had acquired by
the storm, or to currents that had set that way by the violence of the
winds. Contenting ourselves with this, we expected all soon to be right
again; and as we had no prospect of ever seeing our companions, we kept
the best look-out we could to see for any vessel coming that course
which might take us in, and resolved to rest all our hopes upon that.

When we had sailed a good while after this manner, we knew not whither,
Adams called out, "I see land!" My heart leapt within me for joy, and
we hoped the current that seemed to carry us so fast set in for some
islands or rivers that lay before us. But still we were exceedingly
puzzled at the ship's making such way, and the nearer we approached the
land, which was now very visible, the more speed the ship made, though
there was no wind stirring. We had but just time to think on this
unexpected phenomenon, when we found that what we had taken for land was
a rock of an extraordinary height, to which, as we advanced nearer,
the ship increased its motion, and all our strength could not make her
answer her rudder any other way. This put us under the apprehension
of being dashed to pieces immediately, and in less than half an hour I
verily thought my fears had not been groundless. Poor Adams told me he
would try when the ship struck if he could leap upon the rock, and ran
to the head for that purpose; but I was so fearful of seeing my danger
that I ran under hatches, resolving to sink in the ship. We had no
sooner parted but I felt so violent a shock that I verily thought the
ship had brought down the whole rock upon her, and been thereby dashed
to pieces, so that I never more expected to see the light.

I lay under this terror for at least half an hour, waiting the ship's
either filling with water or bulging every moment. But finding neither
motion in her nor any water rise, nor the least noise whatsoever, I
ventured with an aching heart from my retreat, and stole up the hatchway
as if an enemy had been on deck, peeping first one way then another.
Here nothing presented but confusion, the rock hung over the hatchway
at about twenty feet above my head, our foremast lay by the board, the
mainmast yard-arm was down, and great part of the mainmast snapped
off with it, and almost everything upon deck was displaced. This sight
shocked me extremely; and calling for Adams, in whom I hoped to find
some comfort, I was too soon convinced I had lost him.

Wilkins thinks of destroying himself--His soliloquy--Strange accident in
the hold--His surprise--Cannot climb the rock--His method to sweeten his
water--Lives many months on board---Ventures to sea in his boat several
times, and takes many fish--Almost overcome by an eel.


CHAPTER IX.

After I had stood a while in the utmost confusion of thought, and my
spirits began to be a little composed, I was resolved to see what damage
the hull of the ship had received. Accordingly I looked narrowly, but
could find none, only she was immovably fixed in a cleft of the
rock, like a large archway, and there stuck so fast, that though upon
fathoming I could find no bottom, she never moved in the least by the
working of the water.

I now began to look upon Adams as a happy man, being delivered by an
immediate death from such an inextricable scene of distress, and wished
myself with him a thousand times. I had a great mind to have followed
him into the other world; yet I know not how it is, there is something
so abhorrent to human nature in self-murder, be one's condition what
it will, that I was soon determined on the contrary side. Now again I
perceived that the Almighty had given me a large field to expatiate in
upon the trial of His creatures, by bringing them into imminent dangers
ready to overwhelm them, and at the same time, as it were, hanging out
the flag of truce and mercy to them. These thoughts brought me to my
knees, and I poured out my soul to God in a strain of humiliation,
resignation to His will, and earnest petitions for deliverance or
support in this distress. Having finished, I found myself in a more
composed frame; so having eaten a biscuit and drank a can of water, and
not seeing anything to be done whereby I could better my condition, I
sat me down upon the deck, and fell into the following soliloquy--

Peter, says I, what have you to do here?--Alas! replied I to myself, I
am fixed against my will in this dismal mansion, destined, as rats might
be, to devour the provisions only, and having eaten all up, to perish
with hunger for want of a supply.--Then, says I, of what use are you in
the world, Peter?--Truly, answered I, of no other use that I can see but
to be an object of misery for Divine vengeance to work upon, and to show
what a deplorable state human nature can be reduced to; for I cannot
think any one else can be so wretched.--And again, Peter, says I, what
have you been doing ever since you came into the world?--I am afraid,
says I, I can answer no better to this question than to either of the
former; for if only reasonable actions are to be reckoned among my
doings, I am sure I have done little worth recording; for let me see
what it all amounts to. I spent my first sixteen years in making a fool
of my mother; my three next in letting her make a fool of me, and in
being fool enough myself to get me a wife and two children before I was
twenty. The next year was spent in finding out the misery of slavery
from experience. Two years more I repined at the happiness of my
benefactor, and at finding it was not my lot to enjoy the same. This
year is not yet spent, and how many more are to come, and where they may
be passed, and what they may produce, requires a better head than mine
even to guess at; but certainly my present situation seems to promise
nothing beside woe and misery.--But hold a little, says I, and let me
clearly state my own wretchedness. I am here, it is true; but for any
good I have ever done or any advantage I have reaped in other places, I
am as well here as anywhere. I have no present want of food or unjust
or cruel enemy to annoy me; so as long as the ship continues entire
and provisions last, I shall do tolerably. Then why should I grieve
or terrify myself about what may come? What my frighted imagination
suggests may perhaps never happen. Deliverance, though not to be looked
for, is yet possible; and my future fate may be as different from
my present condition as this is from the hopes with which I lately
flattered myself. And why, after all, may I not die a natural death
here as well as anywhere? All mankind die, and then there is an end of
all----An end of all! did I say? No, there is something within that
gives me the lie when I say so. Let me see; Death, my master used to
say, is not an end, but a beginning of real life: and may it not be so?
May I not as well undergo a change from this to a different state of
life when I leave this world, as be born into it I know not from whence?
Who sent me into this world? Who framed me of two natures so unlike,
that death cannot destroy but one of them? It must be the Almighty God.
But all God's works tend to some end; and if He has given me an immortal
nature, it must be His intention that I should live somewhere and
somehow for ever. May not this stage of being then be only an
introduction to a preparative for another? There is nothing in this
supposition repugnant to reason. Upon the whole, if God is the author of
my being, He only has a right to dispose of it, and I may not put an end
thereto without His leave. It is no less true that my continuing therein
during His pleasure, and because it is so, may turn vastly to my
advantage in His good time; it may be the means of my becoming happy for
even when it is His will that I go hence. It is no less probable that,
dismal as my present circumstances appear, I may be even now the object
of a kind Providence: God may be leading me by affliction to repentance
of former crimes; destroying those sensual affections that have all my
days kept me from loving and serving Him. I will therefore submit myself
to His will, and hope for His mercy.

These thoughts, and many others I then had, composed me very much, and
by degrees reconciled me to my destined solitude. I walked my ship, of
which I was now both master and owner, and employed myself in searching
how it was fastened to the rock, and where it rested; but all to no
purpose as to that particular. I then struck a light and went into the
hold, to see what I could find useful, for we had never searched the
ship since we took her.

In the hold I found abundance of long iron bars, which I suppose were
brought out to be trafficked with the blacks. I observed they lay
all with one end close to the head of the ship, which I presumed was
occasioned by the violent shock they received when she struck against
the rock; but seeing one short bar lying out beyond the rest, though
touching at the end of one of the long bars, I thought to take it up,
and lay it on the heap with the others; but the moment I had raised
the end next the other bars, it flew out of my hand with such violence,
against the head of the ship, and with such a noise, as greatly
surprised me, and put me in fear it had broke through the plank.

I just stayed to see no harm was done, and ran upon deck with my hair
stiff on my head; nor could I conceive less than that some subtle spirit
had done this prank merely to terrify me.

It ran in my pate several days, and I durst upon no account have gone
into the hold again, though my whole support had lain there; nay, it
even spoiled my rest, for fear something tragical should befall me, of
which this amazing incident was an omen.

About a week after, as I was shifting myself (for I had not taken my
clothes off since I came there), and putting on a new pair of shoes
which I found on board, my own being very bad, taking out my iron
buckles, I laid one of them upon a broken piece of the mast that I sat
upon; when to my astonishment, it was no sooner out of my hand but up it
flew to the rock and stuck there. I could not tell what to make of it,
but was sorry the devil had got above deck. I then held several other
things one after another in my hand, and laid them down where I laid the
buckle, but nothing stirred till I took out the fellow of that from the
shoes; when letting it go away, it jumped also to the rock.

I mused on these phenomena for some time, and could not forbear calling
upon God to protect me from the devil; who must, as I imagined, have
a hand in such unaccountable things as they then seemed to me. But at
length reason got the better of these foolish apprehensions, and I began
to think there might be some natural cause of them, and next to be
very desirous of finding it out In order to this I set about making
experiments to try what would run to the rock and what would not. I went
into the captain's cabin, and opening a cupboard, of which the key was
in the door, I took out a pipe, a bottle, a pocket-book, a silver spoon,
a tea-cup, &c, and laid them successively near the rock; when none of
them answered, but the key which I had brought out of the cupboard on
my finger dropping off while I was thus employed, no sooner was it
disengaged but away it went to it. After that I tried several other
pieces of iron-ware with the like success. Upon this, and the needle of
my compass standing stiff to the rock, I concluded that this same rock
contained great quantity of loadstone, or was itself one vast magnet,
and that our lading of iron was the cause of the ship's violent course
thereto, which I mentioned before.

This quite satisfied me as to my notions of spirits, and gave me a more
undisturbed night's rest than I had had before, so that now, having
nothing to affright me, I passed the time tolerably well in my solitude,
as it grew by degrees familiar to me.

I had often wished it had been possible for me to climb the rock, but
it was so smooth in many places and craggy in others, and over-hanging,
continuing just the same to the right and left of me as far as ever I
could see, that from the impossibility of it, I discharged all thoughts
of such an attempt.

I had now lived on board three months, and perceived the days grow
shorter and shorter, till, having lost the sun for a little time, they
were quite dark: that is, there was no absolute daylight, or indeed
visible distinction between day and night; though it was never so dark
but I could see well enough upon deck to go about.

What now concerned me the most was my water, which began to grow very
bad (though I had plenty of it) and unsavoury, so that I could scarce
drink it, but had no prospect of better. Now and then indeed it snowed
a little, which I made some use of, but this was far from contenting me.
Hereupon I began to contrive; and having nothing else to do, I set two
open vessels upon deck, and drawing water from the hold I filled one of
my vessels, and letting it stand a day and a night I poured it into the
other, and so shifted it every twenty-four hours; this, I found, though
it did not bring it to the primitive taste and render it altogether
palatable, was nevertheless a great help to it, by incorporating the
fresh air with it, so that it became very potable, and this method I
constantly used with my drinking-water, so long as I stayed on board the
ship.

It had now been sharp weather for some time, and the cold still
increasing, this put me upon rummaging the ship farther than ever I
thought to do before; when opening a little cabin under deck, I found a
large cargo of fine French brandy, a great many bottles, and some small
casks of Madeira wine, with divers cordial waters. Having tasted these,
and taken out a bottle or two of brandy, and some Madeira, I locked up
my door and looked no farther that time.

The next day I inquired into my provisions, and some of my flesh having
soaked out the pickle, I made fresh pickle and closed it up again. I
that day also found several cheeses cased up in lead, one of which I
then opened and dined upon: but what time of day or night it was when I
eat this meal I could not tell. I found a great many chests well filled,
and one or two of tools which some years after stood me in a very good
stead, though I did not expect they would ever be of that service when I
first met with them.

In this manner I spent my time till I began to see broad daylight again,
which cheered me greatly. I had been often put in hopes during the dark
season that ships were coming towards me, and that I should once more
have the conversation of mankind, for I had by the small glimmering seen
many large bodies (to my thinking) move at a little distance from me,
and particularly toward the reappearing of the light, but though I
hallooed as loud as I could, and often fired my gun, I never received an
answer.

When the light returned, my days increased in proportion as they had
before decreased; and gathering comfort from that, I determined to
launch my small boat and to coast along the island, as I judged it, to
see if it was inhabited and by whom; I determined also to make me some
lines for fishing, and carry my gun to try for other game, if I found
a place for landing; for though I had never, since my arrival, seen a
single living creature but my cat, except insects, of which there were
many in the water and in the air before the dark weather, and then began
to appear again, yet I could not but think there were both birds and
beasts to be met with.

Upon launching my boat I perceived she was very leaky, so I let her fill
and continue thus a week or more to stop her cracks, then getting down
the side of my ship I scooped her quite dry and found her very fit for
use; so putting on board my gun, lines, brandy bottles, and clothes
chest for a seat, with some little water and provisions for a week, I
once more committed myself to the sea, having taken all the observation
I could to gain my ship again if any accident should happen, though I
resolved upon no account to quit sight of the rock willingly.

I had not rowed very long before I thought I saw an island to my right
about a league distant, to which I inclined to steer my course, the sea
being very calm; but upon surveying it nearer, I found it only a great
cake of ice, about forty yards high above the water and a mile or two
in length. I then concluded that what I had before taken for ships were
only these lumps of ice. Being thus disappointed as to my island, I
made what haste I could back to the rock again and coasted part of
its circumference; but though I had gone two or three leagues of its
circuit, the prospect it afforded was just the same.

I then tried my lines by fastening several very long ones, made of the
log-line, to the side of the boat, baiting them with several different
baits, but took only one fish of about four pounds weight, very much
resembling a haddock, part of which I dressed for my supper after my
return to the ship, and it proved very good. Towards evening I returned
to my home, as I may call it.

The next day I made a voyage on the other side of the rock, though but
to a small distance from the ship, with intent only to fish, but took
nothing. I had then a mind to victual my boat or little cruiser, and
prepare myself for a voyage of two or three days, which I thought I
might safely undertake, as I had never seen a troubled sea since I came
to the island; for though I heard the wind often roaring over my head,
yet it coming always from the land-side, it never disturbed the water
near the shore. I set out the same way I went at first, designing to
sail two or three days out and as many home again, and resolved if
possible to fathom the depth as I went. With this view I prepared a very
long line with a large shot tied in a rag at the end of it, by way of
plummet, but I felt no ground till the second night The next morning I
came into thirty fathom water, then twenty, then sixteen. In both tours
I could perceive no abatement in the height or steepness of the rock.

In about fourteen fathom water I dropped my lines, and lay by for an
hour or two. Feeling several jars as I sat on my chest in the boat, I
was sure I had caught somewhat, so pulling up my lines successively, I
brought first a large eel near six feet long and almost as thick as my
thigh, whose mouth, throat, and fins, were of a fine scarlet, and
the belly as white as snow: he was so strong while in the water, and
weighty, I had much ado to get him into the boat, and then had a harder
job to kill him; for though, having a hatchet with me to cut wood in
case I met with any landing-place, I chopped off his head the moment I
had him on board, yet he had several times after that have like to have
broken my legs and beat me overboard before I had quite taken his life
from him, and had I not whipped off his tail and also divided his body
into two or three pieces, I could not have mastered him. The next I
pulled up was a thick fish like a tench, but of another colour and much
bigger. I drew up several others, flat and long fish, till I was tired
with the sport; and then I set out for the ship again, which I reached
the third day.

During this whole time, I had but one shot, and that was as I came
homewards, at a creature I saw upon a high crag of the rock, which I
fired at with ball, fearing that my small shot would not reach it The
animal, being mortally wounded, bounded up, and came tumbling down the
rock, very near me. I picked it up, and found it to be a creature not
much unlike our rabbits, but with shorter ears, a longer tail, and
hoofed like a kid, though it had the perfect fluck of a rabbit I put it
into my boat, to contemplate on when I arrived at the ship; and, plying
my oars, got safe, as I said, on the third day.

I made me a fire to cook with as soon as I had got my cargo out of the
boat into my ship, but was under debate which of my dainties to begin
upon. I had sometimes a mind to have broiled my rabbit, as I called it,
and boiled some of my fish; but being tired, I hung up my flesh till
the next day, and boiled two or three sorts of my fish, to try which was
best. I knew not the nature of most of them, so I boiled a piece of my
eel, to be sure, judging that, however I might like the others, I should
certainly be able to make a good meal of that. This variety being ready,
I took a little of my oil out of the hold for sauce, and sat down to my
meal, as satisfied as an emperor. But upon tasting my several messes,
though the eel was rather richer than the smaller fishes, yet the others
were all so good, I gave them the preference for that time, and laid by
the rest of the eel, and of the other fish, till the next day, when I
salted them for future use.

I kept now a whole week or more at home, to look farther into the
contents of the ship, bottle off a cask of Madeira, which I found
leaking, and to consume my new stores of fish and flesh, which, being
somewhat stale when first salted, I thought would not keep so well as
the old ones that were on board. I added also some fresh bread to my
provision, and sweetened more water by the aforementioned method; and
when my necessary domestic affairs were brought under, I then projected
a new voyage.


CHAPTER X.

     Lays in great store of provisions--Resolves to traverse the
     rock--Sails for three weeks, still seeing it only--Is sucked
     under the rock, and hurried down a cataract--Continues there
     five weeks--His description of the cavern--His thoughts and
     difficulties--His arrival at a great lake--And his landing
     in the beautiful country of Graundevolet

I had for a long time wanted to see the other side of the rock, and
at last resolved to try if I could not coast it quite round; for, as
I reasoned with myself, I might possibly find some landing-places, and
perhaps a convenient habitation on shore. But as I was very uncertain
what time that might take up, I determined on having provisions,
instruments of divers kinds, and necessary utensils in plenty, to guard
against accidents as well as I could. I therefore took another sea-chest
out of the hold of the ship, and letting it into my boat, replenished it
with a stock of wine, brandy, oil, bread, and the like, sufficient for
a considerable voyage. I also filled a large cask with water, and took
a good quantity of salt to cure what fish I should take by the way. I
carried two guns, two brace of pistols, and other arms, with ammunition
proportionable; also an axe or two, a saw to cut wood if I should see
any, and a few other tools, which might be highly serviceable if I could
land. To all these I added an old sail, to make a covering for my goods
and artillery against the weather. Thus furnished and equipped, having
secured my hatches on board, and everything that might spoil by wet, I
set out, with a God's speed, on my expedition, committing myself once
more to Providence and the main ocean, and proceeding the same way I
went the first time.

I did not sail extraordinary fast, but frequently fished in proper
places, and caught a great deal, salting and drying the best of what I
took. For three weeks' time and more, I saw no entrance into the island,
as I call it, nor anything but the same unscalable rock. This uniform
prospect gave me so little hopes of landing, that I was almost of a mind
to have returned again. But, on mature deliberation, resolving to go
forward a day or two more, I had not proceeded twenty-four hours, when,
just as it was becoming dark, I heard a great noise, as of a fall of
water, whereupon I proposed to lie by and wait for day, to see what it
was; but the stream insensibly drawing me on, I soon found myself in an
eddy; and the boat drawing forward beyond all my power to resist it, I
was quickly sucked under a low arch, where, if I had not fallen flat in
my boat, having barely light enough to see my danger, I had undoubtedly
been crushed to pieces or driven overboard. I could perceive the boat
to fall with incredible violence, as I thought, down a precipice, and
suddenly whirled round and round with me, the water roaring on all
sides, and dashing against the rock with a most amazing noise.

I expected every moment my poor little vessel would be staved against
the rock, and I overwhelmed with waters; and for that reason never once
attempted to rise up, or look upon my peril, till after the commotion
had in some measure ceased. At length, finding the perturbation of the
water abate, and as if by degrees I came into a smoother stream, I took
courage just to lift up my affrighted head; but guess, if you can, the
horror which seized me, on finding myself in the blackest of darkness,
unable to perceive the smallest glimmer of light.

However, as my boat seemed to glide easily, I roused myself and struck a
light; but if I had my terrors before, what must I have now! I was quite
stupefied at the tremendous view of an immense arch over my head, to
which I could see no bounds; the stream itself, as I judged, was about
thirty yards broad, but in some places wider, in some narrower. It was
well for me I happened to have a tinder-box, or, though I had escaped
hitherto, I must have at lust perished; for in the narrower parts of the
stream, where it ran swiftest, there were frequently such crags stood
out from the rock, by reason of the turnings and windings, and such
sets of the current against them, as, could I not have seen to manage my
boat, which I took great care to keep in the middle of the stream, must
have thrown me on them, to my inevitable destruction.

Happy it was for me, also, I was so well victualled, and that I had
taken with me two bottles of oil (as I supposed, for I did not imagine
I had any more), or I had certainly been lost, not only through hunger,
for I was, to my guess, five weeks in the vault or cavern, but for
want of light, which the oil furnished, and without which all other
conveniences could have been of no avail to me. I was forced to keep my
lamp always burning; so, not knowing how long my residence was to be in
that place, or when I should get my discharge from it, if ever, I was
obliged to husband my oil with the utmost frugality; and notwithstanding
all my caution, it grew low, and was just spent, in little above half
the time I stayed there.

I had now cut a piece of my shirt for a wick to my last drop of oil,
which I twisted and lighted. I burnt the oil in my brass tobacco-box,
which I had fitted pretty well to answer the purpose Sitting down, I had
many black thoughts of what must follow the loss of my light, which I
considered as near expiring, and that, I feared, for ever. I am here,
thought I, like a poor condemned criminal, who knows his execution
is fixed for such a day, nay, such an hour, and dies over and over in
imagination, and by the torture of his mind, till that hour comes: that
hour, which he so much dreads! and yet that very hour which releases him
from all farther dread! Thus do I--my last wick is kindled--my last drop
of fuel is consuming!--and I am every moment apprehending the shocks of
the rock, the suffocation of the water; and, in short, thinking over my
dying thoughts, till the snuff of my lamp throws up its last curling,
expiring flame, and then my quietus will be presently signed, and I
released from my tormenting anxiety! Happy minute! Come then; I only
wait for thee! My spirits grew so low and feeble upon this, that I had
recourse to my brandy bottle to raise them; but, as I was just going to
take a sip, I reflected that would only increase thirst, and, therefore,
it were better to take a little of my white Madeira; so, putting
my dram-bottle again into the chest, I held up one of Madeira, as I
fancied, to the lamp, and seeing it was white (for I had red too) I
clapped it eagerly to my mouth, when the first gulp gave me a greater
refreshment, and more cheered my heart, than all the other liquors I had
put together could have done; insomuch, as I had almost leaped over the
boat's side for joy. "It is oil!" cried I aloud, "it is oil!" I set it
down carefully, with inexpressible pleasure; and examining the rest of
the bottles I had taken for white Madeira, I found two more of those
to be filled with oil. "Now," says I, "here is the counterpart of my
condemned prisoner! For let but a pardon come, though at the gallows,
how soon does he forget he has been an unhappy villain! And I, too, have
scarce a notion now, how a man, in my case, could feel such sorrow as I
have for want of a little oil."

After my first transport, I found myself grow serious, reflecting upon
the vigilance of Providence over us poor creatures, and the various
instances wherein it interposes to save or relieve us in cases of
the deepest distress, where our own foresight, wisdom, and power have
utterly failed, and when, looking all around, we could discover no
means of deliverance. And I saw a train of circumstances leading to
the incident I have just mentioned, which obliged me to acknowledge the
superintendence of Heaven over even my affairs; and as the goodness
of God had cared for me thus far, and manifested itself to me now, in
rescuing me, as it were, from being swallowed up in darkness, I had
ground to hope He intended a complete deliverance of me out of
that dismal abyss, and would cause me yet to praise Him in the full
brightness of day.

A series of these meditations brought me (at the end of five weeks, as
nearly as I could compute it by my lamp) to a prodigious lake of water,
bordered with a grassy down, about half a mile wide, of the finest
verdure I had ever seen: this again was flanked with a wood or grove,
rising like an amphitheatre, of about the same breadth; and behind, and
above all, appeared the naked rock to an immense height.


CHAPTER XI.

     His joy on his arrival at land--A description of the place--
     No inhabitants--Wants fresh water--Resides in a grotto--
     Finds water--Views the country--Carries his things to the
     grotto.

It is impossible to express my joy at the sight of day once more. I got
on the land as soon as possible after my dismission from the cavern,
and, kneeling on the ground, returned hearty thanks to God for my
deliverance, begging, at the same time, grace to improve His mercies,
and that I might continue under His protection, whatever should
hereafter befall me, and at last die on my native soil.

I unloaded my vessel as well as I could, and hauled her up on the
shore; and, turning her upside down, made her a covering for my arms
and baggage. I then sat down to contemplate the place, and eat a most
delightful meal on the grass, being quite a new thing to me.

I walked over the greensward to the wood, with my gun in my hand, a
brace of pistols in my girdle, and my cutlass hanging before me; but,
when I was just entering the wood, looking behind me and all around the
plain, "Is it possible," says I, "that so much art (for I did not then
believe it was natural) could have been bestowed upon this place, and
no inhabitant in it? Here are neither buildings, huts, castle, nor any
living creature to be seen! It cannot be," says I, "that this place was
made for nothing!"

I then went a considerable way into the wood, and inclined to have gone
much farther, it being very beautiful, but, on second thoughts, judged
it best to content myself at present with only looking out a safe
retreat for that night; for, however agreeable the place then seemed,
darkness was at hand, when everything about me would have more or less
of horror in it.

The wood, at its first entrance, was composed of the most charming
flowering shrubs that can be imagined; each growing upon its own stem,
at so convenient a distance from the other, that you might fairly pass
between them any way without the least incommodity. Behind them grew
numberless trees, somewhat taller, of the greatest variety of shapes,
forms, and verdures the eye ever beheld; each, also, so far asunder as
was necessary for the spreading of their several branches and the growth
of their delicious fruits, without a bush, briar, or shrub amongst them.
Behind these, and still on the higher ground, grew an infinite number
of very large, tall trees, much loftier than the former, but intermixed
with some underwood, which grew thicker and closer the nearer you
approached the rock. I made a shift to force my way through these as far
as the rock, which rose as perpendicular as a regular building, having
only here and there some crags and unevennesses. There was, I observed,
a space all the way between the underwood and the rock, wide enough
to drive a cart in; and, indeed, I thought it had been left for that
purpose.

I walked along this passage a good way, having tied a rag of the lining
of my jacket at the place of my entrance, to know it again at my coming
back, which I intended to be ere it grew dark; but I found so much
pleasure in the walk, and surveying a small natural grotto which was in
the rock, that the daylight forsook me unawares: whereupon I resolved
to put off my return unto the boat till next morning, and to take up my
lodging for that night in the cave.

I cut down a large bundle of underwood with my cutlass, sufficient to
stop up the mouth of the grotto, and laying me down to rest, slept as
sound as if I had been on board my ship; for I never had one hour's rest
together since I shot the gulf till this. Nature, indeed, could not have
supported itself thus long under much labour; but as I had nothing to do
but only keep the middle stream, I began to be as used to guide myself
in it with my eyes almost closed, and my senses retired, as a higgler is
to drive his cart to market in his sleep.

The next morning I awaked sweetly refreshed; and, by the sign of my rag,
found the way again through the underwood to my boat I raised that up a
little, took out some bread and cheese, and, having eat pretty heartily,
laid me down to drink at the lake, which looked as clear as crystal,
expecting a most delicious draught; but I had forgot it brought me
from the sea, and my first gulp almost poisoned me. This was a sore
disappointment, for I knew my water-cask was nigh emptied; and, indeed,
turning up my boat again, I drew out all that remained, and drank it,
for I was much athirst.

However, I did not despair; I was now so used to God's providence, and
had a sense of its operations so riveted in my mind, that though the
vast lake of salt water was surrounded by an impenetrable rock or
barrier of stone, I rested satisfied that I should rather find even that
yield me a fresh and living stream, than that I should perish for want
of it.

With this easy mind did I travel five or six miles on the side of the
lake, and sometimes stepped into the wood, and walked a little there,
till I had gone almost half the diameter of the lake, which lay in a
circular or rather an oval figure. I had then thoughts of walking back,
to be near my boat and lodging, for fear I should be again benighted
if I went much farther; but, considering I had come past no water, and
possibly I might yet find some if I went quite round the lake, I rather
chose to take up with a new lodging that night, than to return; and I
did not want for a supper, having brought out with me more bread and
cheese than had served for dinner, the remainder of which was in the
lining of my jacket. When it grew darkish, I had some thoughts of
eating; but I considered, as I was then neither very hungry nor dry, if
I should eat it would but occasion drought, and I had nothing to
allay that with; so I contented myself for that night to lay me down
supperless.

In the morning I set forward again upon my water search, and hoped to
compass the whole lake that day. I had gone about seven miles more,
when, at a little distance before me, I perceived a small hollow or cut
in the grass from the wood to the lake; thither I hasted with all speed,
and blessed God for the supply of a fine fresh rill, which, distilling
from several small clefts in the rock, had collected itself into one
stream, and cut its way through the green sod to the lake.

I lay down with infinite pleasure, and swallowed a most cheering draught
of the precious liquid; and, sitting on the brink, made a good meal of
what I had with me, and then drank again. I had now got five-sixths of
the lake's circumference to go back again to my boat, for I did not
suspect any passage over the cavern's mouth where I came into the lake;
and I could not, without much trouble, consider that, if I would have
this water for a constant supply, I must either come a long way for it,
or fix my habitation near it. I was just going back again, revolving
these uneasy thoughts in my breast, when this rose suddenly in my mind,
that, if I could possibly get over the mouth of the cavern, I should not
have above three miles from my grotto to the water. Now, as I could not
get home that night otherwise than by crossing it, and as, if I lost my
labour, I should be but where I was, whereas if I should get over it, it
would very much shorten my journey, I resolved to try whether the
thing was practicable, first, however, looking out for a resting-place
somewhere near my water, if I should meet with a disappointment.

I then walked into the wood, where, meeting with no place of retreat to
my liking, I went to my rill, and taking another sup, determined not to
leave that side of the lake till morning; but having some time to
spare, I walked about two miles to view the inlet of the lake, and was
agreeably surprised, just over the mouth of the cavern, to see a large
stone arch like a bridge, as if it had been cut out of the rock, quite
across the opening: this cheered me vastly, and, pushing over it, I
found a path that brought me to my boat before night.

I then went up to my grotto for the third night in this most delightful
place; and the next morning early I launched my boat, and taking my
water-cask and a small dipping bucket with me, I rowed away for the
rill, and returned highly pleased with a sufficiency of water, whereof
I carried a bucket and a copper kettle full up with me to the grotto.
Indeed, it was not the least part of my satisfaction that I had this
kettle with me; for though I was in hopes, in my last voyage, I should
have come to some shore, where I could have landed and enjoyed myself
over some of my fish, and for that reason had taken it, notwithstanding
things did not turn out just as I had schemed, yet my kettle proved the
most useful piece of furniture I had.

Having now acquainted myself with the circumference of the lake, and
settled a communication with my rill, I began to think of commencing
housekeeper. In order thereunto, I set about removing my goods up to the
grotto. By constant application, in a few days I had gotten all thither
but my two great chests and my water-cask; and how to drag or drive
any of those to it, I was entirely at a loss. My water-cask was of the
utmost importance to me, and I had thoughts sometimes of stopping it
close, and rolling it to the place; but the ascent through the wood to
the grotto was so steep, that, besides the fear of staving it,
which would have been an irreparable loss, I judged it impossible to
accomplish it by my strength; so with a good deal of discontent, I
determined to remit both that and the chests to future consideration.

     that building--The author makes a little cart--Also a wet

Having come to a full resolution of fixing my residence at the
grotto, and making that my capital seat, it is proper to give you some
description of it.

This grotto, then, was a full mile from the lake, in the rock which
encompassed the wood. The entrance was scarcely two feet wide, and about
nine feet high, rising from the height of seven feet upward to a point
in the middle. The cavity was about fifteen feet long within, and about
five wide. Being obliged to lie lengthwise in it, full six feet of it
were taken up at the farther end for my lodging only, as nothing could
stand on the side of my bed that would leave me room to come at it. The
remaining nine feet of the cave's length were taken up, first, by my
fireplace, which was the deepest side of the doorway, ranging with my
bed (which I had set close to the rock on one side), and took up near
three feet in length; and my furniture and provisions, of one sort or
other, so filled up the rest, that I had much ado to creep between them
into my bed.

In the chest which I had taken for a seat in the boat, as aforesaid,
upon breaking it open by the water-side, I found a mattress, some
shirts, shoes, stockings, and several other useful things; a small case
of bottles with cordials in them, some instruments of surgery, plasters
and salves; all which, together with a large quantity of fish that I had
salted, I carried to the grotto.

My habitation being thus already overcharged, and as I could not,
however, bear the thoughts of quitting it, or of having any of my
goods exposed to the weather on the outside, I was naturally bent on
contriving how I should increase my accommodations. As I had no prospect
of enlarging the grotto itself, I could conceive no other way of
effecting my desire but by the addition of an outer room. This thought
pleased me very much, so that the next day I set myself to plan out the
building, and trace the foundation of it.

I told you before there was about the space of a cart-way between the
wood and the rock clear; but this breadth, as I was building for
life (so I imagined), not appearing to me spacious enough for my new
apartment, I considered how I should extend its bounds into the wood.
Hereupon I set myself to observe what trees stood at a proper distance
from my grotto, that might serve as they stood, with a little management
of hewing and the like, to compose a noble doorway, posts, and
supporters; and I found, that upon cutting down three of the nearest
trees, I should answer my purpose in this respect; and there were
several others, about twenty feet from the grotto, and running parallel
with the rock, the situation of which was so happily adapted to my
intention, that I could make them become, as I fancied, an out-fence or
wall; so I took my axe and cut down my nearest trees, but as I was
going to strike, a somewhat different scheme presented itself to my
imagination that altered my resolution.

In conformity with this new plan, I fixed the height of my intended
ceiling, and sawed off my nearest trees to that, sloping from the sides
to the middle, to support cross-beams for the roof to rest on, and left
the trunks standing, by way of pillars, both for the use and ornament of
the structure. In short, I worked hard every day upon my building for a
month, in which time I had cut all my timber into their proper lengths
for my outworks and covering, but was at a great stand how to fix my
side-posts, having no spade or mattock, and the ground almost as hard
as flint, for to be sure it had never been stirred since the creation. I
then thought I had the worst part of my job to get over; however, I went
on, and having contrived, in most of my upright side-quarters, to take
the tops of trees, and leave on the lower parts their cleft, where they
began to branch out and divide from the main stem, I set one of them
upright against the rock, then laid one end of my long ceiling-pieces
upon the cleft of it, and laid the other end upon a tree on the same
side, whose top I had also sawed off with a proper cleft I then went and
did the same on the other side; after this I laid on a proper number of
cross-beams, and tied all very firmly together with the bark of young
trees stripped off in long thongs, which answered that purpose very
well. Thus I proceeded, crossing, joining, and fastening all together,
till the whole roof was so strong and firm that there was no stirring
any part of it I then spread it over with small lop wood, on which I
raised a ridge of dried grass and weeds, very thick, and thatched over
the whole with the leaves of a tree very much resembling those of a
palm, but much thicker, and not quite so broad; the entire surface, I
might say, was as smooth as a die, and so ordered, by a gentle declivity
every way, as to carry off the wet.

Having covered in my building, I was next to finish and close the
walls of it; the skeleton of these was composed of sticks, crossing one
another checker-wise and tied together; to fill up the voids, I wove
upon them the longest and most pliable twigs of the underwood I could
find, leaving only a doorway on one side, between two stems of a tree
which, dividing in the trunk at about two feet from the ground, grew
from thence, for the rest of its height, as if the branches were a
couple of trees a little distance from one another, which made a sort of
stile-way to my room. When this was all done, I tempered up some earth
by the lake-side, and mixing it to a due consistence with mud, which I
took from the lake, applied it as a plastering in this manner: I divided
it into pieces, which I rolled up of the size of a foot-ball; these
lumps I stuck close by one another on the lattice, pressing them very
hard with my hands, which forced part of them quite through the small
twigs, and then I smoothed both sides with the back of my saw, to about
the thickness of five or six inches; so that by this means I had a wall
round my new apartment a foot thick. This plaster-work cost me some time
and a great deal of labour, as I had a full mile to go to the lake
for every load of stuff, and could carry but little at once, it was so
heavy; but there was neither water for tempering, nor proper earth to
make it with any nearer. At last, however, I completed my building in
every respect but a door, and for this I was forced to use the lid of my
sea chest; which indeed I would have chosen not to apply that way, but
I had nothing else that would, do; and there was, however, this
conveniency, that it had hinges ready fixed thereon.

I now began to enjoy myself in my new habitation, like the absolute and
sole lord of the country, for I had neither seen man nor beast since my
arrival, save a few animals in the trees like our squirrels, and some
water-rats about the lake; but there were several strange kinds of birds
I had never before seen, both on the lake and in the woods.

That which now troubled me most was how to get my water nearer to me
than the lake, for I had no lesser vessel than the cask, which held
above twenty gallons, and to bring that up was a fatigue intolerable.
My next contrivance, therefore, was this: I told you I had taken my
chest-lid to make a door for my ante-chamber, as I now began to call it;
so I resolved to apply the body of the chest also to a purpose different
from that it originally answered. In order to this, I went to the lake
where the body of the chest lay, and sawed it through within about three
inches of the bottom. Of the two ends, having rounded them as well as I
could, I made two wheels; and with one of the sides I made two more. I
burnt a hole through the middle of each; then preparing two axle-trees,
I fastened them, after putting on the wheels, to the bottom of the chest
with the nails I had drawn out, of it. Having finished this machine, on
which I bestowed no small labour, I was hugely pleased with it, and only
wished I had a beast, if it were but an ass, to draw it; however, that
task I was satisfied to perform myself, since there was no help for it;
so I made a good strong cord out of my fishing-lines, and fixed that
to drag it by. When all was thus in readiness, filling my water-cask,
I bound it thereon, and so brought it to the grotto with such ease,
comparatively, as quite charmed me. Having succeeded so well in the
first essay, I no sooner unloaded but down went I again with my cart,
or truckle rather, to the lake, and brought from thence on it my other
chest, which I had left entire.

I had now nothing remaining near the lake but my boat, and had half a
mind to try to bring that up too; but having so frequent occasion for
her to get my water in, which I used in greater abundance now than I had
done at first, a great part going to supply my domestic uses, as well as
for drinking, I resolved against that, and sought out for a convenient
dock to stow it in as a preservative against wind and weather, which I
soon after effected; for having pitched upon a swampy place, overgrown
with a sort of long flags or reeds, I soon cut a trench from the lake,
with a sort of spade or board that I had chopped and sharpened for that
use.

Thus having stowed my boat and looked over all my goods and sorted them,
and taken a survey of my provisions, I found I must soon be in want
of the last if I did not forthwith procure a supply; for though I had
victualled so well at setting out, and had been very sparing ever since,
yet had it not been for a great quantity of fish I took and salted in my
passage to the gulf, I had been to seek for food much sooner. Hereupon I
thought it highly prudent to look out before I really wanted.

With this resolution I accoutred myself, as in my first walk, with my
instruments and arms; but instead of travelling the lake-side, I went
along the wood, and therein found great plenty of divers kinds of fruits
\ though I could scarce persuade myself to taste or try the effects
of them, being so much unlike our own, or any I had seen elsewhere. I
observed amongst the shrubs abundance of a fruit, or whatever else you
may call it, which grew like a ram's-horn; sharp at the point next the
twig it was fastened to, and circling round and round, one fold upon
another, which gradually increased to the size of my wrist in the
middle, and then as gradually decreased till it terminated in a point
again at the contrary extreme; all which spiral, if it were fairly
extended in length, might be a yard or an ell long. I surveyed this
strange vegetable very attentively; it had a rind, or crust, which I
could not break with my hand, but taking my knife and making an opening
therewith in the shell, there issued out a sort of milky liquor in great
quantity, to at least a pint and half, which having tasted, I found as
sweet as honey, and very pleasant: however, I could not persuade myself
any more than just to taste it. I then found on the large trees several
kinds of fruit, like pears or quinces, but most of them exceeding hard
and rough, and quite disagreeable; so I quitted my hopes of them.

About three miles from my grotto I met with a large space of ground full
of a low plant, growing only with a single woody stalk half a foot
high, and from thence issued a round head, about a foot or ten inches
diameter, but quite flat, about three-quarters of an inch thick, and
just like a cream-cheese standing upon its edge: these grew so close
together, that upon the least wind stirring, their heads rattled against
each other very musically; for though the stalks were so very strong
that they would not easily either bend or break, yet the fanning of the
wind upon the broad heads twisting the stalks, so as to let the heads
strike each other, they made a most agreeable sound.

I stood some time admiring this shrub, and then cutting up one of them,
I found it weighed about two pounds; they had a tough green rind or
covering, very smooth, and the inside full of a stringy pulp, quite
white. In short, I made divers other trials of berries, roots, herbs,
and what else I could find, but received little satisfaction from any
of them for fear of bad qualities. I returned back ruminating on what
things I had seen, resolving to take my cart the next walk, and bring
it home loaded with different kinds of them, in order to make my trials
thereof at leisure: but my cart being too flat and wanting sides, I
considered it would carry very little, and that what it would otherwise
bear, on that account, must tumble and roll off, so I made a fire and
turned smith; for with a great deal to do breaking off the wards of a
large key I had, and making it red-hot, I by degrees fashioned it into a
kind of spindle, and therewith making holes quite round the bottom of my
cart, in them I stuck up sticks about two feet high that I had tapered
at the end to fit them.

Having thus qualified my cart for a load, I proceeded with it to the
wood, and cutting a small quantity of each species of green, berry,
fruit, and flower that I could find, and packing them severally in
parcels, I returned at night heavy-laden, and held a council with myself
what use they could most properly be applied to.

I had amongst my goods, as I said, a copper-kettle which held about a
gallon: this I set over my fire and boiled something by turns of every
sort in it, watching all the while, and with a stick stirring and
raising up one thing and then another, to feel when they were boiled
tender: but of upwards of twenty greens which I thus dressed, only one
proved eatable, all the rest becoming more stringy, tough, and
insipid for the cooking. The one I have excepted was a round, thick,
woolly-leafed plant, which boiled tender and tasted as well as spinach;
I therefore preserved some leaves of this to know it again by; and for
distinction called it by the name of that herb.

I then began upon my fruits of the pear and quince kind, at least eight
different sorts; but I found I could make nothing of them, for they were
most of them as rough and crabbed after stewing as before, so I laid
them all aside. Lastly, I boiled my ram's-horn and cream-cheese, as I
called them, together. Upon tasting the latter of these, it was become
so watery and insipid, I laid it aside as useless. I then cut the other
and tasted the juice, which proved so exceeding pleasant that I took a
large gulp or two of it, and tossed it into the kettle again.

Having now gone through the several kinds of my exotics, I had a mind
to re-examine them after cooling, but could make nothing of any of my
greens but the spinach. I tried several berries and nuts too, but, save
a few sort of nuts, they were all very tasteless. Then I began to review
the fruits, and could find but two sorts that I had any the least hopes
from. I then laid the best by and threw the others away. After this
process, which took me up near a whole day, and clearing my house of
good-for-nothings, I returned to reexamine my cheese, that was grown
cold, and was now so dry and hard I could not get my teeth into it; upon
which I was going to skim it away out of my grotto, saying, "Go, thou
worthless!" (for I always spoke aloud my thoughts to myself)--I say I
was just despatching it when I checked my hands, and as I could make
no impression with my teeth, had a mind to try what my knife would do.
Accordingly I began at the edge of the quarter, for I had boiled but a
quarter of it, but the rind was grown so hard and brittle that my knife
slipping and raking along the cut edge of it, scratched off some powder
as white as possible; I then scraped it backward and forward some time,
till I found it would all scrape away in this powder, except the rind,
upon which I laid it aside again for farther experiment.

During this review my kettle and ram's-horn had been boiling, till
hearing it blubber very loud, and seeing there was but little liquor in
it, I whipped it off the fire, for fear of burning its bottom, but took
no further notice of it till about two hours after; when returning
to the grotto, I went to wash out my kettle, but could scarce get my
ram's-horn from the bottom; and when I did, it brought up with it a
sort of pitchy substance, though not so black, and several gummy threads
hanging to it, drawn out to a great length. I wondered at this, and
thought the shell of the ram's-horn had melted, or some such thing,
till, venturing to put a little of the stuff on my tongue, it proved to
my thinking as good treacle as I had ever tasted.

This new discovery pleased me very much. I scraped all the sweet thing
up, and laid it near my grotto in a large leaf of one of the trees
(about two feet long, and broad in proportion) to prevent its running
about. In getting this curiosity out of my kettle, I found in it a small
piece of my cheese, which I suppose had been broke off in stirring; and
biting it (for it was soft enough) I think it was the most luscious and
delicate morsel I ever put into my lips. This unexpected good fortune
put me on trying the best of my pears again; so setting on my kettle,
with very little water, and putting some of my treacle into it, and two
of the best pears quartered, I found, upon a little boiling, they also
became an excellent dainty.

Having succeeded so well, I was quite ripe for another journey with
my cart; which I accordingly undertook, taking my route over the stone
bridge, to see what the other side of the lake produced. In travelling
through the trees, I met, amongst other things, with abundance of large
gourds, which, climbing the trees, displayed their fruit to the height
of twenty or thirty feet above the ground. I cut a great many of
these, and some very large ones of different hues and forms; which of
themselves making a great load, with some few new sorts of berries and
greens, were the gathering of that day. But I must tell you I was almost
foiled in getting them home; for coming to my stone bridge, it rose so
steep, and was so much ruggeder than the grass or wood ground, that I
was at a set upon the first entrance and terribly afraid that I should
either break my wheels or pull off my axle-trees. Hereupon I was forced
to unload, and carry my cargo over in my arms to the other side of the
bridge; whither having then, with less fear but much caution, drawn my
cart, I loaded again and got safe home.

I was mightily pleased with the acquisitions of this journey; for now,
thought I, I shall have several convenient family utensils; so spent the
next day or two in scooping my gourds and cleaning away the pulp. When I
had done this, finding the rinds to be very weak and yielding, I made
a good fire, and setting them round it at a moderate distance to dry,
I went about something else without doors: but, alas! my hopes were ill
founded; for coming home to turn my gourds and see how dry they were, I
found them all warped and turned into a variety of uncouth shapes. This
put me to a stand; but, however, I recovered some pieces of them for
use, as the bottom parts of most of them, after paring away the sides,
would hold something, though they by no means answered my first purpose.

Well, thought I, what if I have lost my gourds, I have gained
experience. I will dry them next time with the guts in, and having
stiffened their rinds in their proper dimensions, then try to cleanse
them. So next morning (for I was very eager at it) I set out with my
cart for another load; and having handed them over the bridge, got safe
with them to the grotto. These by proper management proved exceedingly
valuable to me, answering, in one way or other, the several uses of
plates, bottles, pans, and divers other vessels.

I now got a large quantity of the vegetable ram's-horn, and filled a
great many of the gourds with the treacle it yielded; I also boiled and
dried a large parcel of my cheeses, and hung them up for use, for I had
now for some time made all my bread of the latter, scraping and bruising
the flour, and mixing it with my treacle and water; and this indeed made
such a sweet and nourishing bread, that I could even have lived wholly
upon it; but I afterwards very much improved it by putting the milky
juice of the ram's-horn, unboiled, to my flour in a small quantity, and
then baking it on the hearth, covered over with embers. This detracted
nothing from the sweetness and mellowness of my bread, but made it much
lighter than the treacle alone would have done.

Finding there was no fear of starving, but so far from it, that from
day to day I found out something new to add to my repast, either in
substantials or by way of dessert, I set me down very well contented
with my condition. I had nothing to do but to lay up store against
sickness and the dark weather, which last I expected would soon be upon
me, as the days were now exceeding short. Indeed, though I had now been
here six months, I had never seen the sun since I first entered the
gulf; and though there was very little rain, and but few clouds, yet the
brightest daylight never exceeded that of half an hour after sunset in
the summer-time in England, and little more than just reddened the
sky. For the first part of my time here, there was but little if any
difference between day and night; but afterwards, what I might call the
night, or lesser degree of light, took up more hours than the greater,
and went on gradually increasing as to time, so that I perceived total
darkness approached, such as I had on board my ship the year before.


CHAPTER XIII.

     The author lays in a store against the dark weather-Hears
     voices--His thoughts thereon--Persuades himself it was a
     dream--Hears them again--Determines to see if any one lodged
     in the rock--Is satisfied there is nobody--Observations on
     what he saw--Finds a strong weed like whipcord--Makes a
     drag-net--Lengthens it--Catches a monster--Its description--
     Makes oil of it

I had now well stored my grotto with all sorts of winter provisions, and
feeling the weather grow very cold, I expected and waited patiently for
the total darkness. I went little abroad, and employed myself within
doors endeavouring to fence against the approaching extremity of the
cold. For this purpose I prepared a quantity of rushes, which being
very dry, I spread them smoothly on the floor of my bed-chamber a good
thickness, and over them I laid my mattress. Then I made a double sheet
of the boat's awning or sail, that I had brought to cover my goods; and
having skewered together several of the jackets and clothes I found in
the chest, of them I made a coverlid; so that I lay very commodiously,
and made very long nights of it now the dark season was set in.

As I lay awake one night, or day, I know not which, I very plainly heard
the sound of several human voices, and sometimes very loud; but though
I could easily distinguish the articulations, I could not understand the
least word that was said; nor did the voices seem at all to me like such
as I had anywhere heard before, but much softer and more musical. This
startled me, and I rose immediately, slipping on my clothes and taking
my gun in my hand (which I always kept charged, being my constant
travelling companion) and my cutlass. Thus equipped, I walked into my
ante-chamber, where I heard the voices much plainer, till after some
little time they by degrees died quite away. After watching here, and
hearkening a good while, hearing nothing, I walked back into the grotto,
and laid me down again on my bed. I was inclined to open the door of my
ante-chamber, but I own I was afraid; besides, I considered that if I
did, I could discover nothing at any distance by reason of the thick and
gloomy wood that enclosed me.

I had a thousand different surmises about the meaning of this odd
incident; and could not conceive how any human creatures should be in
my kingdom (as I called it) but myself, and I never yet see them, or any
trace of their habitation. But then again I reflected, that though I had
surrounded the whole lake, yet I had not traced the out-bounds of the
wood next the rock, where there might be innumerable grottoes like mine;
nay, perhaps some as spacious as that I had sailed through to the lake;
and that though I had not perceived it, yet this beautiful spot might be
very well peopled. But, says I again, if there be any such beings as
I am fancying here, surely they don't skulk in their dens, like savage
beasts, by daylight, and only patrole for prey by night; if so, I shall
probably become a delicious morsel for them ere long, if they meet with
me. This kept me still more within doors than before, and I hardly ever
stirred out but for water or firing. At length, hearing no more voices,
nor seeing any one, I began to be more composed in my mind, and at last
grew persuaded it was all a mere delusion, and only a fancy of mine,
without any real foundation; and sometimes, though I was sure I was
fully awake when I heard them, I persuaded myself I had rose in my
sleep, upon a dream of voices, and recollected with myself the various
stories I had heard when a boy of walking in one's sleep, and the
surprising effects of it; so the whole notion was now blown over.

I had not enjoyed my tranquillity above a week, before my fears were
roused afresh, hearing the same sound of voices twice the same night,
but not many minutes at a time. What gave me most pain was that they
were at such a distance, as I judged by the languor of the sound, that
if I had opened my door I could not have seen the utterers through the
trees, and I was resolved not to venture out; but then I determined, if
they should come again anything near my grotto, to open the door, see
who they were, and stand upon my defence, whatever came of it: For, says
I, my entrance is so narrow and high that more than one cannot come at a
time; and I can with ease despatch twenty of them before they can
secure me, if they should be savages; but if they prove sensible human
creatures, it will be a great benefit to me to join myself to their
society. Thus had I formed my scheme, but I heard no more of them for a
great while; so that at length beginning to grow ashamed of my fears, I
became tranquil again.

The day now returning, and with it my labours, I applied to my usual
callings; but my mind ran strangely upon viewing the rock quite round,
that is, the whole circuit of my dominions; for, thinks I, there may
possibly be an outlet through the rock into some other country, from
whence the persons I heard may come. As soon therefore as the days grew
towards the longest, I prepared for my progress. Having lived so well at
home since my settlement, I did not care to trust only to what I could
pick up in the woods for my subsistence during this journey, which would
not only take up time in procuring, but perhaps not agree with me; so
I resolved to carry a supply with me, proportionate to the length of my
perambulation. Hereupon considering that though my walk round the lake
was finished in two days, yet as I now intended to go round by the rock,
the way would be much longer and perhaps more troublesome than that was;
remembering also my journey with Glanlepze in Africa, and how much
I complained of the fruits we carried for our subsistence; these
circumstances, I say, laying together, I resolved to load the cart with
a variety of food, bread and fruits especially, and draw that with me.

Thus provided, I sallied forth with great cheerfulness, and proceeded in
the main easily; though in some places I was forced to make way with
my hatchet, the ground was so over-run with underwood. I very narrowly
viewed the rock as I went, bottom and sides, all the way, but could see
nothing like a passage through it, or indeed any more than one opening,
or inlet, which I entered for about thirty yards, but it was not above
three feet wide, and terminated in the solid rock.

After some days' travel (making all the observations I could on the
several plants, shrubs, and trees which I met with, particularly where
any of these occurred to me entirely new), finding myself a little
faintish, I had a mind for a sup of ram's-horn juice; so I cut me one,
but upon opening it found therein only a pithy pulp, and noways fit to
taste. I supposed by this I was too early for the milk, it being three
months later the last year when I cut them. Hereon, seeing one upon
another shrub, which by its rusty colour I judged might have hung all
the winter, I opened that, and found it full of milk; but putting some
of it into my mouth, it was as sour as any vinegar I ever tasted in my
life. So, thinks I (and said so too; for, as I told you before, I always
spoke out), here's sauce for something when I want it; and this gave
me a hint to store myself with these gourds, to hang by for vinegar the
next winter.

By this time I had come almost to my rill, when I entered upon a large
plat of ground miserably over-run with weeds, matted together very
thick. These choked up my wheels in such a manner that I could neither
free them with my hands, nor get either backwards or forwards, they
binding my cart down like so many cords; so that I was obliged to cut my
way back again with my hatchet, and take a sweep round in the wood, on
the outside of these weeds.

In all my life I never saw anything of its size, for it was no thicker
than a whipcord, so strong as this weed; and what raised my wonder was
the length of it, for I drew out pieces of it near fifty feet long, and
even they were broken at the end, so that it might be as long again for
aught I know, for it was so matted and twisted together, that it was a
great trial of patience to untangle it; but that which was driest,
and to me looked the rottenest and weakest, I found to be much the
strongest. Upon examination of its parts, I discovered it to be
composed of an infinite number of small threads, spirally overlaying and
enfolding one another.

As I saw but few things that I could not find a use for, so this I
perceived would serve all the common purposes of packthread; a thing I
was often in want of. This inclined me to take a load of it home with
me. Indeed the difficulty of getting a quantity in the condition I
desired it, puzzled me a little; for, says I, if I cut up a good deal
of it with my hatchet, as I first designed, I shall only have small
lengths, good for little, and to get it in pieces of any considerable
length, so as to be of service, will require much time and labour. But
reflecting how much I needed it, and of what benefit it would be,
I resolved to make a trial of what I could do; so, without more
hesitation, I went to work, and cutting a fibre close to its root,
I extricated that thread from all its windings, just as one does an
entangled whipcord. When I had thus disengaged a sufficient length, I
cut that off, and repeating the like operation, in about three hours'
time, but with no little toil, I made up my load of different lengths
just to my liking. Having finished this task, I filled the gourd,
brought for that purpose, with water; and having first viewed the whole
remaining part of the rock, I returned over the stone bridge home again.

This journey, though it took me up several days, and was attended
with some fatigue, had yet given me great satisfaction; for now I
was persuaded I could not have one rival or enemy to fear in my whole
dominions. And from the impossibility, as I supposed, of there being
any, or of the ingress of any, unless by the same passage I entered
at, and by which I was well assured they could never return, I grew
contented, and blamed myself for the folly of my imaginary voices, as I
called them then, and took it for a distemper of the fancy only.

The next day I looked over my load of matweed, having given it that
name, and separated the different lengths from each other. I then found
I had several pieces between forty and fifty feet long, of which I
resolved to get a good number more, to make me a drag-net that I might
try for some fish in the lake. A day or two after, therefore, I brought
home another load of it Then I picked out a smooth level spot upon the
green-sward, and having prepared a great number of short wooden pegs, I
strained a line of the matweed about ten feet long, tying it at each end
to a peg, and stuck a row of pegs along by that line, about two inches
asunder; I next strained another line of the same length, parallel to
that, at the distance of forty feet from it, and stuck pegs thereby,
corresponding to the former row; and from each peg on one side, to the
opposite peg on the other, I tied a like length of my mat-line, quite
through the whole number of pegs; when the work looked like the inside
of a harpsichord. I afterwards drove pegs in like manner along the whole
length of the two outermost longer lines, and tied shorter lines to
them, so that the whole affair then represented the squares of a racket;
the corners of each of which squares I tied very tight with smaller
pieces of the line, till I had formed a complete net of forty feet long
and ten wide.

When I had finished my net, as I thought, I wrapped several stones
in rags, and fastened them to the bottom to sink it, and some of the
smallest unscooped dry gourds to the top, to keep that part buoyant. I
now longed to begin my new trade, and carried the net to my boat with
that intention; but after two or three hauls I found it would not answer
for want of length (though by chance I caught a blackish fish without
scales, a little bigger than whiting, but much longer, which stuck by
the gills in it); so I left the net in the boat, resolving to make an
addition to it with all speed; and returning to my grotto, I supped on
the fish I had taken and considered how to pursue my enterprise with
better effect.

I provided me with another large parcel of line; and having brought two
more lengths to perfection, I joined all together, and fixing one end
on shore, by a pole I had cut for that purpose, I launched my boat, with
the other end in it, taking a sweep the length of my net round to
my stick again, and getting on shore, hauled up my net by both ends
together. I found now I had mended my instrument, and taken a proper way
of applying it; for by this means, in five hauls, I caught about sixteen
fish of three or four different sorts, and one shell-fish, almost like
a lobster, but without great claws, and with a very small short tail;
which made me think, as the body was thrice as long as a lobster's in
proportion, that it did not swim backwards, like that creature, but
only crawled forwards (it having lobsterlike legs, but much shorter and
stronger), and that the legs all standing so forward, its tail was, by
its motion, to keep the hinder part of the body from dragging upon the
ground, as I observed it did when the creature walked on land, it then
frequently flacking its short tail.

These fish made me rich in provisions. Some of them I ate fresh, and the
remainder I salted down. But of all the kinds, my lobster was the most
delicious food, and made me almost three meals.

Thus finding there were fish to be had, though my present tackle seemed
suitable enough to my family, yet could I not rest till I had improved
my fishery by enlarging my net; for as it was, even with my late
addition, I must either sweep little or no compass of ground, or it
would have no bag behind me. Upon this I set to work and shortly doubled
the dimensions of it. I had then a mind to try it at the mouth of my
rill; so taking it with me the next time I crossed the lake for water,
and fastening it to my pole, close by the right side of the rill, I
swept a long compass round to the left, and closing the ends, attempted
to draw it up in the hollow cut of the rill. But by the time I had
gathered up two-thirds of the net, I felt a resistance that quite
amazed me. In short, I was not able to stand against the force I felt.
Whereupon sitting down in the rill, and clapping my feet to the two
sides of it, I exerted all my strength, till finally I became conqueror,
and brought up so shocking a monster, that I was just rising to run
for my life on the sight of it. But recollecting that the creature was
hampered, and could not make so much resistance on the land as in the
water, I ventured to drag the net up as far from the rill as my strength
and breath would permit me; and then running to the boat for my gun,
I returned to the net to examine my prize. Indeed, I had not instantly
resolution enough to survey it, and when at length I assumed courage
enough to do so, I could not perfectly distinguish the parts, they were
so discomposed; but taking hold of one end of the net, I endeavoured to
disentangle the thing, and then drawing the net away, a most surprising
sight presented itself: the creature reared upright, about three feet
high, covered all over with long, black shaggy hair, like a bear, which
hung down from his head and neck quite along his back and sides. He had
two fins, very broad and large, which, as he stood erect, looked like
arms, and these he waved and whirled about with incredible velocity; and
though I wondered at first at it, I found afterwards it was the motion
of these fins that kept him upright; for I perceived when they ceased
their motion he fell flat on his belly. He had two very large feet,
which he stood upon, but could not run, and but barely walk on them,
which made me in the less haste to despatch him; and after he had stood
upon his feet about four minutes, clapping his fins to his sides, he
fell upon his belly.

When I found he could not attack me, I was moving closer to him; but
upon sight of my stirring, up he rose again, and whirled his fins about
as before so long as he stood. And now I viewed him round, and found
he had no tail at all, and that his hinder fins, or feet, very much
resembled a large frog's, but were at least ten inches broad, and
eighteen long, from heel to toe; and his legs were so short that when he
stood upright his breech bore upon the ground. His belly, which he kept
towards me, was of an ash-colour, and very broad, as also was his breast
His eyes were small and blue, with a large black sight in the middle,
and rather of an oval than round make. He had a long snout like a boar,
and vast teeth. Thus having surveyed him near half an hour living, I
made him rise up once more and shot him in the breast. He fell, and
giving a loud howl, or groan, expired.

I had then time to see what else I had caught; and turning over the net,
found a few of the same fish I had taken before, and some others of a
flat-tish make, and one little lump of flesh unformed; which last, by
all I could make of it, seemed to be either a spawn or young one of that
I had shot.

The great creature was so heavy, I was afraid I must have cut him in
pieces to get him to the boat; but with much ado, having stowed the
rest, I tumbled him on board. I then filled my water-cask and rowed
homewards. Being got to land, I was obliged to bring down my cart, to
carry my great beast-fish, as I termed him, up to the grotto. When I had
got him thither, I had a notion of first tasting, and then, if I liked
his flesh, of salting him down and drying him; so, having flayed him and
taken out the guts and entrails, I boiled a piece of him; but it made
such a blaze that most of the fat ran into the fire, and the flesh
proved so dry and rank that I could no ways endure it.

I then began to be sorry I had taken so much pains for no profit, and
had endangered my net into the bargain (for that had got a crack or two
in the scuffle), and was thinking to throw away my large but worthless
acquisition.

However, as I was now prone to weighing all things, before I threw it
away I resolved to consider a little; whereupon I changed my mind.
Says I, Here is a good warm skin, which, when dry, will make me a rare
cushion. Again, I have for a long while had no light beside that of the
day; but now as this beast's fat makes such a blaze in the fire, and
issues in so great a quantity from such a small piece as I broiled, why
may not I boil a good tallow or oil out of it? and if I can, I have not
made so bad a hand of my time as I thought for.

In short, I went immediately to work upon this subject (for I never let
a project cool after I had once started it), and boiled as much of the
flesh as the kettle would hold, and letting it stand to cool, I found
it turned out very good oil for burning; though I confess I thought it
would rather have made tallow. This success quickened my industry; and I
repeated the operation till I got about ten quarts of this stuff, which
very well rewarded my labour. After I had extracted as much oil as I
could from the beast-fish, the creature having strongly impressed my
imagination, I conceived a new fancy in relation to it; and that was,
having heard him make a deep, howling groan at his death, I endeavoured
to persuade myself, and at last verily believed, that the voices I
had so often heard in the dark weather proceeded from numbers of these
creatures, diverting themselves in the lake, or sporting together on
the shore; and this thought, in its turn, contributed to ease my
apprehensions in that respect.


CHAPTER XIV.

     The author passes the summer pleasantly--Hears the voices in
     the winter--Ventures out--Sees a strange sight on the lake--
     His uneasiness at it--His dream--Soliloquy--Hears the
     voices again, and perceives a great shock on his building--
     Takes up a beautiful woman--He thinks her dead, but recovers
     her--A description of her--She stays with him

I passed the summer (though I had never yet seen the sun's body) very
much to my satisfaction: partly in the work I have been describing (for
I had taken two more of the beast-fish, and had a great quantity of oil
from them); partly in building me a chimney in my ante-chamber of mud
and earth burnt on my own hearth into a sort of brick; in making a
window at one end of the abovesaid chamber, to let in what little light
would come through the trees when I did not choose to open my door;
in moulding an earthen lamp for my oil; and, finally, in providing and
laying in stores, fresh and salt (for I had now cured and dried many
more fish), against winter. These, I say, were my summer employments
at home, intermixed with many agreeable excursions. But now the winter
coming on, and the days growing very short, or indeed there being no
day properly speaking, but a kind of twilight, I kept mostly in my
habitation, though not so much as I had done the winter before, when I
had no light within doors, and slept, or at least lay still, great
part of my time; for now my lamp was never out. I also turned two of
my beast-fish skins into a rug to cover my bed, and the third into a
cushion, which I always sat upon, and a very soft and warm cushion
it made. All this together rendered my life very easy, yea, even
comfortable.

An indifferent person would now be apt to ask, What would this man
desire more than he had? To this I answer, that I was contented while my
condition was such as I have been describing; but a little while after
the darkness or twilight came on, I frequently heard the voices again;
sometimes a few only at a time, as it seemed, and then again in great
numbers. This threw me into new fears, and I became as uneasy as ever,
even to the degree of growing quite melancholy; though, otherwise, I
never received the least injury from anything. I foolishly attempted
several times, by looking out of my window, to discover what these odd
sounds proceeded from, though I knew it was too dark to see anything
there.

I was now fully convinced, by a more deliberate attention to them, that
they could not be uttered by the beast-fish, as I had afore conjectured,
but only by beings capable of articulate speech; but then, what or where
they were, it galled me to be ignorant of.

At length, one night or day, I cannot say which, hearing the voices very
distinctly, and praying very earnestly to be either delivered from the
uncertainty they had put me under, or to have them removed from me, I
took courage, and arming myself with gun, pistols, and cutlass, I went
out of my grotto and crept down the wood. I then heard them plainer
than before, and was able to judge from what point of the compass they
proceeded. Hereupon I went forward towards the sound, till I came to the
verge of the wood, where I could see the lake very well by the dazzle of
the water. Thereon, as I thought, I beheld a fleet of boats, covering a
large compass, and not far from the bridge. I was shocked hereat beyond
expression. I could not conceive where they came from, or whither they
would go; but supposed there must be some other passage to the lake than
I had found in my voyage through the cavern, and that for certain they
came that way, and from some place of which as yet I had no manner of
knowledge.

Whilst I was entertaining myself with this speculation, I heard the
people in the boats laughing and talking very merrily, though I was too
distant to distinguish the words. I discerned soon after all the boats
(as I still supposed 'em) draw up, and push for the bridge; presently
after, though I was sure no boat entered the arch, I saw a multitude of
people on the opposite shore all marching towards the bridge; and what
was the strangest of all, there was not the least sign of a boat now
left upon the whole lake. I then was in a greater consternation than
before; but was still much more so when I saw the whole posse of people,
that as I have just said were marching towards the bridge, coming over
it to my side of the lake. At this my heart failed, and I was just going
to run to my grotto for shelter; but taking one look more, I plainly
discovered that the people, leaping one after another from the top of
the bridge, as if into the water, and then rising again, flew in a
long train over the lake, the lengthways of it, quite out of my sight,
laughing, hallooing, and sporting together; so that looking back again
to the bridge and on the lake, I could neither see person nor boat,
nor anything else, nor hear the least noise or stir afterwards for that
time.

I returned to my grotto brimful of this amazing adventure, bemoaning my
misfortune in being at a place where I was like to remain ignorant of
what was doing about me. For, says I, if I am in a land of spirits, as
now I have little room to doubt, there is no guarding against them. I am
never safe, even in my grotto; for that can be no security against such
beings as can sail on the water in no boats, and fly in the air on no
wings, as the case now appears to me, who can be here and there and
wherever they please. What a miserable state, I say, am I fallen to!
I should have been glad to have had human converse, and to have found
inhabitants in this place; but there being none, as I supposed hitherto,
I contented myself with thinking that I was at least safe from all those
evils mankind in society are obnoxious to. But now, what may be the
consequence of the next hour I know not; nay, I am not able to say but
whilst I speak, and show my discontent, they may at a distance conceive
my thoughts, and be hatching revenge against me for my dislike of them.

The pressure of my spirits inclining me to repose, I laid me down, but
could get no rest; nor could all my most serious thoughts, even of the
Almighty Providence, give me relief under my present anxiety: and all
this was only from my state of uncertainty concerning the reality of
what I had heard and seen, and from the earnestness with which I coveted
a satisfactory knowledge of those beings who had just taken their flight
from me.

I really believe the fiercest wild beast, or the most savage of mankind
that had met me, and put me upon my defence, would not have given me
half the trouble that then lay upon me; and the more, for that I had no
seeming possibility of ever being rid of my apprehensions: so finding I
could not sleep, I got up again; but as I could not fly from myself, all
the art I could use with myself was but in vain to obtain me any quiet.

In the height of my distress I had recourse to prayer, with no small
benefit; begging that if it pleased not the Almighty Power to remove
the object of my fears, at least to resolve my doubts about them, and to
render them rather helpful than hurtful to me. I hereupon, as I always
did on such occasions, found myself much more placid and easy, and began
to hope the best, till I had almost persuaded myself that I was out of
danger; and then laying myself down, I rested very sweetly till I was
awakened by the impulse of the following dream.

Methought I was in Cornwall, at my wife's aunt's; and inquiring after
her and my children, the old gentlewoman informed me, both my wife
and children had been dead some time, and that my wife, before her
departure, desired her (that is, her aunt) immediately upon my arrival
to tell me she was only gone to the lake, where I should be sure to see
her, and be happy with her ever after. I then, as I fancied, ran to
the lake to find her. In my passage she stopped me, crying, "Whither so
fast, Peter? I am your wife, your Patty." Methought I did not know her,
she was so altered; but observing her voice, and looking more wistfully
at her, she appeared to me as the most beautiful creature I ever
beheld. I then went to seize her in my arms; but the hurry of my spirits
awakened me.

When I got up, I kept at home, not caring even to look out at my door.
My dream ran strangely in my head, and I had now nothing but Patty in my
mind. "Oh!" cries I, "how happy could I be with her, though I had only
her in this solitude. Oh! that this was but a reality, and not a dream."
And indeed, though it was but a dream, I could scarce refrain from
running to the lake to meet my Patty. But then I checked my folly, and
reasoned myself into some degree of temper again. However, I could not
forbear crying out, "What, nobody to converse with! Nobody to assist,
comfort, or counsel me! This is a melancholy situation indeed." Thus I
ran on lamenting till I was almost weary, when on a sudden I again
heard the voices. "Hark!" says I, "here they come again. Well, I am now
resolved to face them, come life, come death! It is not to be alone I
thus dread; but to have company about me, and not know who or what, is
death to me worse than I can suffer from them, be they who or what they
will."

During my soliloquy the voices increased, and then by degrees diminished
as usual; but I had scarce got my gun in my hand, to pursue my
resolution of showing myself to those who uttered them, when I felt such
a thump upon the roof of my ante-chamber as shook the whole fabric and
set me all over into a tremor. I then heard a sort of shriek, and a
rustle near the door of my apartment; all which together seemed very
terrible. But I, having before determined to see what and who it was,
resolutely opened my door and leaped out I saw nobody; all was quite
silent, and nothing that I could perceive but my own fears amoving. I
went then softly to the corner of the building, and there looking down,
by the glimmer of my lamp which stood in the window, I saw something in
human shape lying at my feet. I gave the word, "Who is there?" Still no
one answered. My heart was ready to force a way through my side. I was
for a while fixed to the earth like a statue. At length, recovering, I
stepped in, fetched my lamp, and returning saw the very beautiful face
my Patty appeared under in my dream; and not considering that it was
only a dream, I verily thought I had my Patty before me; but she seemed
to be stone dead. Upon viewing her other parts (for I had never yet
removed my eyes from her face), I found she had a sort of brown chaplet,
like lace, round her head, under and about which her hair was tucked up
and twined; and she seemed to me to be clothed in a thin hair-coloured
silk garment, which, upon trying to raise her, I found to be quite warm,
and therefore hoped there was life in the body it contained. I then took
her into my arms, and treading a step backwards with her, I put out my
lamp; however, having her in my arms, I conveyed her through the doorway
in the dark into my grotto; here I laid her upon my bed, and then ran
out for my lamp.

This, thinks I, is an amazing adventure. How could Patty come here, and
dressed in silk and whalebone too? Sure that is not the reigning fashion
in England now? But my dream said she was dead. Why, truly, says I, so
she seems to be. But be it so; she is warm. Whether this is the place
for persons to inhabit after death or not, I can't tell (for I see there
are people here, though I don't know them); but be it as it will, she
feels as flesh and blood; and if I can but bring her to stir and act
again as my wife, what matters it to me what she is? It will be a great
blessing and comfort to me; for she never would have come to this very
spot but for my good.

Top-full of these thoughts, I re-entered my grotto, shut my door and
lighted my lamp; when going to my Patty (as I delighted to fancy her),
I thought I saw her eyes stir a little. I then set the lamp farther off
for fear of offending them if she should look up; and warming the last
glass I had reserved of my Madeira, I carried it to her, but she never
stirred. I now supposed the fall had absolutely killed her, and was
prodigiously grieved; when laying my hand on her breast I perceived the
fountain of life had some motion. This gave me infinite pleasure; so,
not despairing, I dipped my finger in the wine and moistened her lips
with it two or three times, and I imagined they opened a little. Upon
this I bethought me, and taking a teaspoon, I gently poured a few drops
of the wine by that means into her mouth. Finding she swallowed it, I
poured in another spoonful, and another, till I brought her to herself
so well as to be able to sit up. All this I did by a glimmering light
which the lamp afforded from a distant part of the room, where I had
placed it, as I have said, out of her sight.

I then spoke to her, and asked divers questions, as if she had really
been Patty and understood me; in return of which she uttered a language
I had no idea of, though in the most musical tone, and with the sweetest
accent I ever heard. It grieved me I could not understand her. However,
thinking she might like to be on her feet, I went to lift her off the
bed, when she felt to my touch in the oddest manner imaginable; for
while in one respect it was as though she had been cased up in whalebone
it was at the same time as soft and warm as if she had been naked.

I then took her in my arms and carried her into my ante-chamber again,
where I would fain have entered into conversation, but found she and
I could make nothing of it together, unless we could understand one
another's speech. It is very strange my dream should have prepossessed
me so of Patty, and of the alteration of her countenance, that I could
by no means persuade myself the person I had with me was not she;
though, upon a deliberate comparison, Patty, as pleasing as she always
was to my taste, would no more come up to this fair creature than a
coarse ale-wife would to Venus herself.

You may imagine we stared heartily at each other, and I doubted not but
she wondered as much as I by what means we came so near each other. I
offered her everything in my grotto which I thought might please her;
some of which she gratefully received, as appeared by her looks and
behaviour. But she avoided my lamp, and always placed her back toward
it. I observing that, and ascribing it to her modesty in my company, let
her have her will, and took care to set it in such a position myself as
seemed agreeable to her, though it deprived me of a prospect I very much
admired.

After we had sat a good while, now and then, I may say, chattering to
one another, she got up and took a turn or two about the room. When I
saw her in that attitude, her grace and motion perfectly charmed me, and
her shape was incomparable; but the strangeness of her dress put me to
my trumps to conceive either what it was, or how it was put on.

Well, we supped together, and I set the best of everything I had before
her, nor could either of us forbear speaking in our own tongue, though
we were sensible neither of us understood the other. After supper I
gave her some of my cordials, for which she showed great tokens of
thankfulness, and often in her way, by signs and gestures, which were
very far from being insignificant, expressed her gratitude for my
kindness. When supper had been some time over, I showed her my bed and
made signs for her to go to it; but she seemed very shy of that, till I
showed her where I meant to lie myself, by pointing to myself, then to
that, and again pointing to her and to my bed. When at length I had made
this matter intelligible to her, she lay down very composedly; and after
I had taken care of my fire, and set the things I had been using for
supper in their places, I laid myself down too; for I could have no
suspicious thoughts or fear of danger from a form so excellent.

I treated her for some time with all the respect imaginable, and never
suffered her to do the least part of my work. It was very inconvenient
to both of us only to know each other's meaning by signs; but I could
not be otherwise than pleased to see that she endeavoured all in her
power to learn to talk like me. Indeed I was not behindhand with her in
that respect, striving all I could to imitate her. What I all the while
wondered at was, she never showed the least disquiet at her confinement;
for I kept my door shut at first, through fear of losing her, thinking
she would have taken an opportunity to run away from me; for little did
I then think she could fly.


CHAPTER XV.

     Wilkin s afraid of losing his new mistress--They live
     together all winter--A remark on that--They begin to know
     each other's language--A long discourse between them at
     cross purposes--She flies--They engage to be man and wife.

After my new love had been with me a fortnight, finding my water run
low, I was greatly troubled at the thought of quitting her any time to
go for more; and having hinted it to her, with seeming uneasiness,
she could not for a while fathom my meaning; but when she saw me much
confused, she came at length, by the many signs I made, to imagine it
was my concern for her which made me so; whereupon she expressively
enough signified I might be easy, for she did not fear anything
happening to her in my absence. On this, as well as I could declare my
meaning, I entreated her not to go away before my return. As soon as she
understood what I signified to her by actions, she sat down, with her
arms across, leaning her head against the wall to assure me she would
not stir. However, as I had before nailed a cord to the outside of the
door, I tied that for caution's sake to the tree, for fear of the worst:
but I believe she had not the least design of removing.

I took my boat, net, and water-cask, as usual, desirous of bringing her
home a fresh fish dinner, and succeeded so well as to catch enough for
several good meals, and to spare. What remained I salted, and found she
liked that better than the fresh, after a few days' salting; though she
did not so well approve of that I had formerly pickled and dried. As my
salt grew very low, though I had been as sparing of it as possible, I
now resolved to try making some; and the next summer I effected it.

Thus we spent the remainder of the winter together, till the days began
to be light enough for me to walk abroad a little in the middle of
them; for I was now under no apprehensions of her leaving me, as she had
before this time had so many opportunities of doing so, but never once
attempted it.

I must here make one reflection upon our conduct, which you will almost
think incredible, viz., that we two, of different sexes, not wanting our
peculiar desires, fully inflamed with love to each other, and no outward
obstacle to prevent our wishes, should have been together, under the
same roof alone for five months, conversing together from morning to
night (for by this time she pretty well understood English, and I her
language), and yet I should never have clasped her in my arms, or have
shown any further amorous desires to her than what the deference I all
along paid her could give her room to surmise. Nay, I can affirm that
I did not even then know that the covering she wore was not the work of
art, but the work of nature, for I really took it for silk; though it
must be premised that I had never seen it by any other light than of my
lamp. Indeed the modesty of her carriage and sweetness of her behaviour
to me had struck into me such a dread of offending her, that though
nothing upon earth could be more capable of exciting passion than her
charms, I could have died rather than have attempted only to salute her
without actual invitation.

When the weather cleared up a little by the lengthening of daylight, I
took courage one afternoon to invite her to walk with me to the lake;
but she sweetly excused herself from it, whilst there was such a
frightful glare of light, as she said; but looking out at the door,
told me, if I would not go out of the wood she would accompany me: so we
agreed to take a turn only there. I first went myself over the stile of
the door, and thinking it rather too high for her, I took her in my arms
and lifted her over. But even when I had her in this manner, I knew not
what to make of her clothing, it sat so true and close; but seeing by a
steadier and truer light in the grove, though a heavy gloomy one, than
my lamp had afforded, I begged she would let me know of what silk or
other composition her garment was made. She smiled, and asked me if mine
was not the same under my jacket "No, lady," says I, "I have nothing
but my skin under my clothes."--"Why, what do you mean?" replies she,
somewhat tartly; "but indeed I was afraid that something was the matter
by that nasty covering you wear, that you might not be seen. Are you
not a glumm?"*--"Yes,"says I, "fair creature." (Here, though you may
conceive she spoke part English, part her own tongue, and I the same, as
we best understood each other, yet I shall give you our discourse, word
for word, in plain English.) "Then," says she, "I am afraid you must
have been a very bad man, and have been crashee,** which I should be
very sorry to hear."

     * A  man.

     ** Slit.

I told her I believed we were none of us so good as we might be, but I
hoped my faults had not at most exceeded other men's; but I had suffered
abundance of hardships in my time; and that at last Providence
having settled me in this spot, from whence I had no prospect of ever
departing, it was none of the least of its mercies to bring to my
knowledge and company the most exquisite piece of all His works, in her,
which I should acknowledge as long as I lived. She was surprised at this
discourse, and asked me (if I did not mean to impose upon her, and was
indeed an ingcrashee* glumm) why I should tell her I had no prospect of
departing hence. "Have not you," says she, "the same prospect that I or
any other person has of departing? Sir," added she, "you don't do
well, and really I fear you are slit, or you would not wear this nasty
cumbersome coat (taking hold of my jacket-sleeve), if you were not
afraid of showing the signs of a bad life upon your natural clothing."

     * Unslit.

I could not for my heart imagine what way there was to get out of my
dominions. But certainly, thought I, there must be some way or other, or
she would not be so peremptory. And as to my jacket, and showing myself
in my natural clothing, I profess she made me blush; and but for shame,
I would have stripped to my skin to have satisfied her. "But, madam,"
says I, "pray pardon me, for you are really mistaken; I have examined
every nook and corner of this new world in which we now are, and can
find no possible outlet; nay, even by the same way I came in, I am sure
it is impossible to get out again."--"Why," says she, "what outlets have
you searched for, or what way can you expect out but the way you came
in? And why is that impossible to return by again? If you are not slit,
is not the air open to you? Will not the sky admit you to patrole in it,
as well as other people? I tell you, sir, I fear you have been slit for
your crimes; and though you have been so good to me, that I can't help
loving of you heartily for it, yet if I thought you had been slit, I
would not, nay, could not, stay a moment longer with you; no, though it
should break my heart to leave you."

I found myself now in a strange quandary, longing to know what she meant
by being slit, and had a hundred strange notions in my head whether I
was slit or not; for though I knew what the word naturally signified
well enough, yet in what manner or by what figure of speech she applied
it to me, I had no idea of. But seeing her look a little angrily upon
me, "Pray, madam," says I, "don't be offended, if I take the liberty to
ask you what you mean by the word crashee* so often repeated by you; for
I am an utter stranger to what you mean by it."--"Sir," says she, "pray
answer me first how you came here?"--"Madam," replied I, "will you
please to take a walk to the verge of the wood, I will show you the very
passage."--"Sir," says she, "I perfectly know the range of the rocks all
round, and by the least description, without going to see them, can tell
from which you descended."--"In truth," said I, "most charming lady, I
descended from no rock at all; nor would I for a thousand worlds attempt
what could not be accomplished but by my destruction."--"Sir," says
she, in some anger, "it is false, and you impose upon me."--"I declare
to you," says I, "madam, what I tell you is strictly true; I never was
near the summit of any of the surrounding rocks, or anything like it;
but as you are not far from the verge of the wood, be so good as to step
a little farther and I will show you my entrance in hither."--"Well,"
says she, "now this odious dazzle of light is lessened, I don't care if
I do go with you."

When we came far enough to see the bridge, "There, madam," says I,
"there is my entrance, where the sea pours into this lake from yonder
cavern."--"It is not possible," says she; "this is another untruth; and
as I see you would deceive me, and are not to be believed, farewell; I
must be gone. But, hold," says she, "let me ask you one thing more; that
is, by what means did you come through that cavern? You could not have
used to have come over the rock?"--"Bless me, madam!" says I, "do you
think I and my boat could fly? Come over the rock, did you say? No,
madam; I sailed from the great sea, the main ocean, in my boat, through
that cavern into this very lake here."--"What do you mean by your boat?"
says she. "You seem to make two things of your boat you say you sailed
with and yourself."--"I do so," replied I; "for, madam, I take myself
to be good flesh and blood, but my boat is made of wood and other
materials."--"Is it so?" says she. "And, pray, where is this boat
that is made of wood and other materials?--under your jacket?"--"Lord,
madam!" says I, "you put me in fear that you were angry; but now I hope
you only joke with me. What, put a boat under my jacket! No, madam; my
boat is in the lake."--"What, more untruths?" says she.--"No, madam," I
replied; "if you would be satisfied of what I say (every word of which
is as true as that my boat now is in the lake), pray walk with me
thither and make your own eyes judges what sincerity I speak with." To
this she agreed, it growing dusky; but assured me, if I did not give her
good satisfaction, I should see her no more.

We arrived at the lake; and going to my wet-dock, "Now, madam," says
I, "pray satisfy yourself whether I spake true or no." She looked at my
boat, but could not yet frame a proper notion of it. Says I, "Madam,
in this very boat I sailed from the main ocean through that cavern into
this lake; and shall at last think myself the happiest of all men if you
continue with me, love me, and credit me; and I promise you I'll never
deceive you, but think my life happily spent in your service." I found
she was hardly content yet to believe what I told her of my boat to be
true; till I stepped into it, and pushing from the shore, took my oars
in my hand, and sailed along the lake by her, as she walked on the
shore. At last she seemed so well reconciled to me and my boat, that she
desired I would take her in. I immediately did so, and we sailed a good
way; and as we returned to my dock I described to her how I procured the
water we drank, and brought it to shore in that vessel.

"Well," says she, "I have sailed, as you call it, many a mile in my
lifetime, but never in such a thing as this. I own it will serve very
well where one has a great many things to carry from place to place; but
to be labouring thus at an oar when one intends pleasure in sailing, is
in my mind a most ridiculous piece of slavery."--"Why, pray, madam, how
would you have me sail? for getting into the boat only will not carry
us this way or that without using some force."--"But," says she, "pray,
where did you get this boat, as you call it?"--"O madam!" says I, "that
is too long and fatal a story to begin upon now; this boat was made many
thousand miles from hence, among a people coal-black, a quite different
sort from us; and, when I first had it, I little thought of seeing this
country; but I will make a faithful relation of all to you when we come
home." Indeed, I began to wish heartily we were there, for it grew into
the night; and having strolled so far without my gun, I was afraid of
what I had before seen and heard, and hinted our return; but I found my
motion was disagreeable to her, and so I dropped it.

I now perceived and wondered at it, that the later it grew the
more agreeable it seemed to her; and as I had now brought her into
good-humour again by seeing and sailing in my boat, I was not willing
to prevent its increase. I told her, if she pleased, we would land, and
when I had docked my boat, I would accompany her where and as long as
she liked. As we talked and walked by the lake, she made a little run
before me and sprung into it Perceiving this, I cried out, whereupon
she merrily called on me to follow her. The light was then so dim, as
prevented my having more than a confused sight of her when she jumped
in; and looking earnestly after her, I could discern nothing more than
a small boat in the water, which skimmed along at so great a rate that I
almost lost sight of it presently; but running along the shore for
fear of losing her, I met her gravely walking to meet me, and then
had entirely lost sight of the boat upon the lake. "This," says she,
accosting me with a smile, "is my way of sailing, which, I perceive, by
the fright you were in, you are altogether unacquainted with; and, as
you tell me you came from so many thousand miles off, it is possible
you may be made differently from me: but, surely we are the part of the
creation which has had most care bestowed upon it; and I suspect, from
all your discourse, to which I have been very attentive, it is possible
you may no more be able to fly than to sail as I do."--"No, charming
creature," says I, "that I cannot, I'll assure you." She then, stepping
to the edge of the lake, for the advantage of a descent before her,
sprung up into the air, and away she went farther than my eyes could
follow her.

I was quite astonished. "So," says I, "then all is over! all a delusion
which I have so long been in! a mere phantom! Better had it been for me
never to have seen her, than thus to lose her again! But what could
I expect had she stayed? For it is plain she is no human composition.
But," says I, "she felt like flesh, too, when I lifted her out at the
door!" I had but very little time for reflection; for, in about ten
minutes after she had left me in this mixture of grief and amazement,
she alighted just by me on her feet.

Her return, as she plainly saw, filled me with a transport not to be
concealed; and which, as she afterwards told me, was very agreeable to
her. Indeed, I was some moments in such an agitation of mind from these
unparalleled incidents, that I was like one thunder-struck; but coming
presently to myself, and clasping her in my arms with as much love and
passion as I was capable of expressing, and for the first time with
any desire,--"Are you returned again, kind angel," said I, "to bless a
wretch who can only be happy in adoring you? Can it be, that you, who
have so many advantages over me, should quit all the pleasures that
nature has formed you for, and all your friends and relations, to take
an asylum in my arms? But I here make you a tender of all I am able
to bestow--my love and constancy."--"Come, come," says she, "no more
raptures; I find you are a worthier man than I thought I had reason
to take you for, and I beg your pardon for my distrust whilst I was
ignorant of your imperfections; but now I verily believe all you have
said is true; and I promise you, as you have seemed so much to delight
in me, I will never quit you till death, or other as fatal accident
shall part us. But we will now, if you choose, go home; for I know you
have been some time uneasy in this gloom, though agreeable to me: for,
giving my eyes the pleasure of looking eagerly on you, it conceals my
blushes from your sight."

In this manner, exchanging mutual endearments and soft speeches, hand
in hand, we arrived at the grotto; where we that night consummated our
nuptials, without farther ceremony than mutual solemn engagements to
each other; which are, in truth, the essence of marriage, and all that
was there and then in our power.

     new wife--Some strange circumstances relating thereto--She
     resolves several questions he asks her, and clears up his
     fears as to the voices--A description of swangeans.

Every calm is succeeded by a storm, as is every storm by its calm; for,
after supper, in order to give my bride the opportunity of undressing
alone, which I thought might be most agreeable the first night, I
withdrew into the antechamber till I thought she was laid; and then,
having first disposed of my lamp, I moved softly towards her, and
stepped into bed too; when, on my nearer approach to her, I imagined she
had her clothes on. This struck a thorough damp over me; and asking her
the reason of it, not being able to touch the least bit of her flesh
but her face and hands, she burst out a-laugh-ing; and, running her hand
along my naked side, soon perceived the difference she before had made
such doubt of between herself and me. Upon which she fairly told me,
that neither she, nor any person she had ever seen before, had any
other covering than what they were born with, and which they would not
willingly part with but with their lives. This shocked me terribly;
not from the horror of the thing itself, or any distaste I had to this
covering (for it was quite smooth, warm, and softer than velvet or the
finest skin imaginable), but from an apprehension of her being so wholly
encased in it, that, though I had so fine a companion, and now a
wife, yet I should have no conjugal benefit from her, either to my own
gratification, or the increase of our species.

In the height of my impatience I made divers essays for unfolding this
covering, but unsuccessfully. Surely, says I, there must be some way of
coming at my wishes, or why should she seem so shy of me at first, and
now we are under engagements to each other, meet me half way with such a
yielding compliance? I could, if I had had time to spare, have gone on,
starting objections and answering them, in my own breast, a great while
longer (for I now knew not what to make of it); but being prompted to
act as well as think, and feeling, as tenderly as possible, upon her
bosom, for the folds or plaits of her garment, she lying perfectly
still, and perceiving divers flat broad ledges, like whale-bone,
seemingly under her covering, which closely enfolded her body, I thought
it might be all laced on together somewhat like stays, and felt behind
for the lacing.

At length, perceiving me so puzzled, and beyond conception vexed at my
disappointment, of asudden, lest I should grow outrageous (which I was
almost come to), she threw down all those seeming ribs flat to her side
so imperceptibly to me, that I knew nothing of the matter, though I lay
close to her; till putting forth my hand again to her bosom, the softest
skin, and most delightful body, free from all impediment, presented
itself to my wishes, and gave itself up to my embraces.

I slept very soundly till morning, and so did she; but at waking I was
very solicitous to find out what sort of being I had had in my arms,
and with what qualities her garment was endued, or how contrived that,
notwithstanding all my fruitless attempts to uncover her, she herself
could so instantaneously dispose of it undiscerned by me. Well, thought
I, she is my wife, I will be satisfied in everything; for surely she
will not now refuse to gratify my curiosity.

We rose with the light; but surely no two were ever more amorous, or
more delighted with each other. I, being up first, lighted the fire, and
prepared breakfast of some fish soup, thickened with my cream-cheese;
and then calling her, I kept my eye towards the bed to see how she
dressed herself; but throwing aside the clothes, she stepped out ready
dressed, and came to me. When I had kissed her, and wished her a good
day, we sat down to breakfast; which being soon over, I told her I hoped
every minute of our lives would prove as happy as those we so lately
passed together; which she seemed to wish with equal ardour. I then told
her, now she was my wife, I thought proper to know her name, which I had
never before asked, for fear of giving uneasiness; for, as I added, I
did not doubt she had observed in my behaviour, ever since I first
saw her, a peculiar tenderness for her, and a sedulous concern not to
offend, which had obliged me hitherto to stifle several questions I
had to ask her whenever they would be agreeable to her. She then bid me
begin; for as she was now my wife, whilst I was speaking it became her
to be all attention, and to give me the utmost satisfaction she could in
all I should require, as she herself should have so great an interest in
everything for the future which would oblige me.

Compliments (if, in compliance with old custom, I may call them so, for
they were by us delivered from the heart) being a little over on both
sides, I first desired to know what name she went by before I found
her: "For," says I, "having only hitherto called you madam, and my lady,
besides the future expression of my love to you in the word dear, I
would know your original name, that so I might join it with that tender
epithet."--"That you shall," says she, "and also my family at another
opportunity; but as my name will not take up long time to repeat at
present, it is Youwarkee. And pray," says she, "now gratify me with the
knowledge of yours."--"My dear Youwarkee," says I, "my name was Peter
Wilkins when I heard it last; but that is so long ago, I had almost
forgot it. And now," says I, "there is another thing you can give me a
pleasure in."--"You need, then, only mention it, my dear Peter," says
she.--"That is," says I, "only to tell me if you did not, by some
accident, fall from the top of the rock over my habitation, upon the
roof of it, when I first took you in here; and whether you are of the
country upon the rocks?"--She, softly smiling, answered, "My dear Peter,
you run your questions too thick. As to my country, which is not on the
rocks, as you suppose, but at a vast distance from hence, I shall leave
that till I may hereafter, at more leisure, speak of my family, as I
promised you before; but as to how I came into this grotto, I knew not
at first, but soon perceived your humanity had brought me in, to take
care of me, after a terrible fall I had; not from the rock, as you
suppose, for then I must not now have been living to enjoy you, but
from a far less considerable height in the air. I'll tell you how it
happened. A parcel of us young people were upon a merry _swangean_*
round this _arkoe_,** which we usually divert ourselves with at set
times of the year, chasing and pursuing one another, sometimes soaring
to an extravagant height, and then shooting down again with surprising
precipitancy, till we even touch the trees; when of a sudden we mount
again and away."

     * Flight.

     ** Water surrounded with a wood.

"I say, being of this party, and pursued by one of my comrades, I
descended down to the very trees, and she after me; but as I mounted,
she over-shooting me, brushed so stiffly against the upper part of
my _graundee_* that I lost my bearing; and being so near the branches
before I could recover it again, I sunk into the tree, and rendered
my graundee useless to me; so that down I came, and that with so much
force, that I but just felt my fall, and lost my senses. Whether I cried
out or no upon my coming to the ground, I cannot say; but if I did, my
companion was too far gone by that time to hear or take notice of me;
as she, probably, in so swift a flight, saw not my fall. As to the
condition I was in, or what happened immediately afterwards, I must
be obliged to you for a relation of that; but one thing I was quickly
sensible of, and never can forget, viz., that I owe my life to your care
and kindness to me."

     * The covering and wings of skin they flew with.

I told her she should have that part of her story from me another time.
"But," says I, "there is something so amazing in these flights, or
swangeans, as you call them, that I must, as the questions for this day,
beg you would let me know what is the method of them. What is the nature
of your covering, which was at first such an obstacle to my wishes? How
you put it on? And how you use it in your swangean?"

"Surely, my dearest Peter," says she, "but that I can deny you nothing,
since you are my _barkatt_* which you seem so passionately to desire,
the latter of your questions would not be answered, for it must put me
to the blush. As to our method of flight, you saw somewhat of that last
night, though in a light hardly sufficient for you; and for the nature
of my covering, you perceive that now; but to show you how it is put on,
as you call it, I am afraid it will be necessary, as far as I can, to
put it off, before I can make you comprehend that; which having done,
the whole will be no farther a mystery. But, not to be tedious, is it
your command that I uncover? Lay that upon me, it shall be done."

     * Husband.

Here I was at a plunge whether to proceed or drop the question. Thinks
I, if my curiosity should be fatal to me, as I may see something I can
never bear hereafter, I am undone. She waits the command! Why so? I know
not the consequence! What shall I do? At last, somewhat resolutely, I
asked her whether her answer either way to my command would cause her to
leave me, or me to love her less? She, seeing my hesitation, and
perceiving the cause, was so pleased, that she cried out--"No, my dear
Peter, not that, nor all the force on earth, shall ever part me from
you. But I conceive you are afraid you shall discover something in me
you may not like. I fear not that; but an immodest appearance before
you I cannot suffer myself to be guilty of, but under your own
command."--"My lovely Youwarkee," says I, "delay then my desires no
longer; and since you require a warrant from me, I do command you to do
it" Immediately her graundee flew open (discovering her naked body just
to the hip, and round the rim of her belly) and, expanding itself, was
near six feet wide. Here my love and curiosity had a hard conflict; the
one to gain my attention to the graundee, and the other to retain my
eyes and thoughts on her lovely body, which I had never beheld so much
of before. Though I was very unwilling to keep her uncovered too long, I
could not easily dismiss so charming a sight I attentively viewed her
lovely flesh, and examined the case that enshrined it; but as I shall
give you a full description of the graundee hereafter, in a more proper
place, I will mention it no farther here, than to tell you that when I
had narrowly surveyed the upper part of it, she in a moment contracted
it round her so close that the nicest eye could not perceive the joining
of the parts. "Indeed, my dear Youwarkee," says I, "you had the best of
reasons for saying you was not fearful I should discover anything in you
displeasing; for if my bosom glowed with love before, you have now
therein raised an ardent flame, which neither time, nor aught else, will
ever be able to extinguish. I now almost conceive how you fly; though
yet I am at a loss to know how you extend and make use of the lower part
of your graundee, which rises up and meets the upper; but I will rather
guess at that by what I have seen, than raise the colour higher in those
fair cheeks, which are, however, adorned with blushes." Then running to
her, and taking her in my arms, I called her the dearest gift of Heaven;
and left off further interrogatories till another opportunity.


CHAPTER XVII.

     Youwarkee cannot bear a strong light--Wilkins makes her
     spectacles, which help her--A description of them

Youwarkee and I having no other company than one another's, we talked
together almost from morn to night, in order to learn each other's
dialect But how compilable soever she was in all other respects, I could
not persuade her to go out with me to fetch water, or to the lake, in
the day-time. It being now the light season, I wanted her to be more
abroad; but she excused herself, telling me her people never came into
those luminous parts of the country during the false glare, as they
called it, but kept altogether at home, where their light was more
moderate and steadier; and that the place where I resided was not
frequented by them for half the year, and at other times only upon
parties of pleasure, it not being worth while to settle habitations
where they could not abide always. She said Normnbdsgrsutt was the
finest region in the world, where her king's court was, and a vast
kingdom. I asked her twice or thrice more to name the country to me,
but not all the art we could use, hers in dictating, and mine in
endeavouring to pronounce it, would render me conqueror of that
her monosyllable (for as such it sounded from her sweet lips); so I
relinquished the name to her, telling her whenever she had any more
occasion to mention the place, I desired it might be under the style of
Doorpt Swangeanti, which she promised; but wondered, as she could speak
the other so glibly, as she called it, I could not do so too.

I told her that the light of my native country was far stronger than any
I had seen since my arrival at Graundevolet (for that, I found by her,
was the name my dominions went by); and that we had a sun, or ball of
fire, which rolled over our heads every day, with such a light, and such
a heat, that it would sometimes almost scorch one, it was so hot, and
was of such brightness that the eye could not look at it without danger
of blindness. She was heartily glad, she said, she was not born in so
wretched a land; and she did not believe there was any other so good
as her own. I thought no benefit could arise from my combating these
innocent prejudices, so I let them alone.

She had often lamented to me the difference of our eyesight, and the
trouble it was to her that she could not at all times go about with me,
till it gave me a good deal of uneasiness to see her concern. At last I
told her, that though I believed it would be impossible to reduce my
sight to the standard of hers, yet I was persuaded I could bring hers to
bear the strongest light I had ever seen in this country. She was
mightily pleased with the thought of that, and said she wished I might,
for she was sensible of no grief like being obliged to stay at home when
I went abroad on my business, and was resolved to try my experiment if I
pleased, and in the meantime should heartily pray for the success. I hit
on the following invention.

I rummaged over all my old things, and by good luck found an old
crape hatband. This I tried myself, single, before my own eyes, in the
strongest light we had; but believing I had not yet obscured it enough,
I doubled it, and then thought it might do; but for fear it should not
I trebled it, and then it seemed too dark for eyes like mine to discover
objects through it, and so I judged it would suit hers; for I was
determined to produce something, if possible, that would do at first,
without repetition of trial, which I thought would only deject her more,
by making her look on the matter as impracticable. I now only wanted a
proper method for fixing it on her, and this I thought would be easily
effected, but had much more difficulty in it than I imagined. A first I
purposed to tie the crape over her eyes, but trying it myself, I found
it very rough and fretting: I then designed fixing it to an old crown of
a hat that held my fish-hooks and lines, and so let it hang down before
her face; but that also had its inconveniences, as it would slap
her eyes in windy weather, and would be not only useless, but very
troublesome in flight; so that I was scarce ever more puzzled before. At
last I thought of a method that answered exceedingly well, the hint
of which I took from somewhat I had seen with my master when I was at
school, which he called goggles, and which he used to tie round his
head to screen his eyes in riding. The thing I made upon that plan was
composed of old hat, pieces of rams-horn, and the above-mentioned crape.

When I had finished the whole apparatus, I tried it first upon myself,
and finding great reason to believe it would perfectly answer the
intention, I ran directly to Youwarkee. "Come," says I, "my dear, will
you go with me to the water-rill; for I must fetch some this morning?"
She shook her head, and, with tears in her eyes, wished she could.
"But," says she, "let me see how light it is abroad."--"No," says I, "my
love, you must not look out till you go."--"Indeed," says she, "if it
did not affect my eyes and head you should not ask me twice."--"Well,"
says I, "my Youwarkee, I am now come to take you with me; and that you
may not suffer by it, turn about, and let me apply the remedy I told
you of for your sight" She wanted much to see first what it was, but I
begged her to forbear till she tried whether it would be useful or not
She told me she would absolutely submit to my direction, so I adjusted
the thing to her head. "Now," says I, "you have it on, let us go out
and try it, and let me know the moment you find the light offensive, and
take particular notice how you are affected." Hereupon away we marched,
and I heard no complaint in all our walk to the lake.

"Now, my dear Youwarkee," says I, when we got there, "what do you think
of my contrivance? Can you see at all?"--"Yes, very well," says she.
"But, my dear Peter, you have taken the advantage of the twilight, I
know, to deceive me; and I had rather have stayed at home than have
subjected you to return in the night for the sake of my company." I then
assured her it was mid-day, and no later, which pleased her mightily;
and, to satisfy her, I untied the string behind, and just let her be
convinced it was so. When I had fixed the shade on her head again, she
put up her hands and felt the several materials of which it consisted;
and after expressing her admiration of it, "So, my dear Peter," says
she, "you have now encumbered yourself with a wife indeed, for since
I can come abroad in a glaring light with so much ease, you will never
henceforward be without my company."

Youwarkee being thus in spirits, we launched the boat, watered, took a
draught of fish, and returned; passing the night at home, in talking of
the spectacles (for that was the name I told her they must go by) and
of the fishing, for that exercise delighted her to a great degree. But,
above all, the spectacles were her chief theme; she handled them and
looked at them again and again, and asked several rational questions
about them; as, how they could have that effect on her eyes, enabling
her to see, and the like. She ventured out with them next day by
herself; and, as she threatened, was as good as her word, for she
scarcely afterwards let me go abroad by myself, but accompanied me
everywhere freely, and with delight.


CHAPTER XVIII.

     Youwarkee with child--Their stock of provisions--No beast or
     fish in Youwarkeis country--The voices again--Her reason for
     not seeing those who uttered them--She bears a son--A hard
     speech in her lying-in--Divers birds appear--Their eggs
     gathered--How Wilkits kept account of time

About three months after we were married, as we called it, Youwarkee
told me she believed she was breeding, and I was mightily pleased with
it, for though I had had two children before by Patty, yet I had never
seen either of them, so that I longed to be a father. I sometimes amused
myself with whimsical conjectures, as, whether the child would have a
graundee or not; which of us it would be most like; how we should do
without a midwife; and what must become of the infant, as we had not
milk, in case Youwarkee could not suckle it. Indeed, I had leisure
enough for indulging such reveries; for, having laid in our winter
stores, my wife and I had nothing to do but enjoy ourselves over a good
fire, prattling and toying together, making as good cheer as we could;
and truly that was none of the worst, for we had as fine bread as need
to be eaten; we had pears preserved; all sorts of dried fish; and once
a fortnight, for two or three days together, had fresh fish; we had
vinegar, and a biting herb which I had found, for pepper; and several
sorts of nuts; so there was no want.

It was at this time, after my return from watering one day, where
Youwarkee had been with me, that, having taken several fish, and amongst
them some I had not before seen, I asked her, as we were preparing and
salting some of them, how they managed fish in her country, and what
variety they had of them there. She told me she neither ever saw nor
heard of a fish in her life till she came to me. "How!" says I, "no fish
amongst you? Why, you want one of the greatest dainties that can be
set upon a table. Do you wholly eat flesh," says I, "at Doorpt
Swangeanti?"--"Flesh," says she laughingly, "of what?"--"Nay," says
I, "you know best what the beasts of your own country are. We have in
England, where I was born and bred, oxen, very large hogs, sheep, lambs,
and calves; these make our ordinary dishes: then we have deer, hares,
rabbits, and these are reckoned dainties; besides numberless kinds of
poultry, and fish without stint"--"I never heard of any of these things
in my life," says Youwarkee, "nor did I ever eat anything but fruits and
herbs, and what is made from them, at Normnbdsgrsutt."--"You will speak
that crabbed word," says I, "again."--"I beg your pardon, my dear,"
says she; "at Doorpt Swangeanti, I say; nor I, nor any one else, to my
knowledge, ever ate any such thing; but seeing you eat fish, as you
call them, I made no scruple of doing so too, and like them very well,
especially the salted ones, for I never tasted what you call salt
neither till I came here."--"I cannot think," says I, "what sort of a
country yours is, or how you all live there."--"Oh," says she, "there
is no want; I wish you and I were there." I was afraid I had talked too
much of her country already, so we called a new cause.

Soon after winter had set in, as we were in bed one night, I heard
the voices again; and though my wife had told me of her countryfolk's
swangeans in that place, I, being frighted a little, waked her; and she
hearing them too, cried out, "There they are! it is ten to one but
my sister or some of our family are there. Hark! I believe I hear
her voice." I myself hearkened very attentively; and by this time
understanding a great deal of their language, I not only could
distinguish different speakers, but knew the meaning of several of the
words they pronounced.

I would have had Youwarkee have gotten up and called to them. "Not for
the world," says she; "have you a mind to part with me? Though I have no
intent to leave you, as I am with child, if they should try to force me
away without my consent, I may receive some injury, to the danger of my
own life, or at least of the child's." This reason perfectly satisfying
me, endeared the loving creature to me ten times more, if possible, than
ever.

The next summer brought me a yawm,* as fair as alabaster.

     * Man-child.

My wife was delivered without the usual assistance, and had as
favourable a labour as could be. The first thing I did, after giving her
some fish-soup, made as skilfully as I was able, and a little cordial,
was to see if my yawm had the graundee or not. Finding it had--"So,"
says I to Youwarkee, "you have brought me a legitimate heir to my
dominions, whose title sure cannot be disputed, being one of you."
Though I spoke this with as much pleasure, and in as endearing a way as
ever I spoke in my life, and quite innocently, the poor Youwarkee burst
into tears to such excess there was no pacifying her. I asked her
the reason of her grief, begged and entreated her to let me know what
disturbed her, but all in vain; till, seeing me in a violent passion,
such as I had never before appeared to be in, she told me she was very
sorry I should question her fidelity to me. She surprised me in saying
this, as I never had any such apprehension. "No, my dearest wife," says
I, "I never had any such suspicion as you charge me with, I can safely
affirm; nor can I comprehend your meaning by imputing such a thing to
me."--"Oh!" says she, "I am sure you have no cause for it; but you said
the poor child was one of us; as much as to intimate that had it been
your own, it would have been born as you were, without the graundee,
which thought I cannot bear, and if you continue to think so it must end
me; therefore take away my life now, rather than let me live to see my
farther misery."

I was heartily sorry for what I had said, when I saw the effects of it,
though I did not imagine it could have been perverted to such a contrary
meaning. But considering her to be the faithful-lest and most loving
creature upon earth, and that true love cannot bear anything
that touches upon or can be applied (though with ever so forced a
construction) to an opprobrious or contemptuous meaning, I attributed
her groundless resentment to her excess of fondness only for me; and
falling upon the bed by her, and bathing her face in my tears, I assured
her the interpretation she had put on my words was altogether foreign
from the view they were spoken with; professing to her that I never had,
nor ever could have, the least cause of jealousy. On my confirming this
absolute confidence in her virtue by the strongest asseverations, she
grew fully convinced of her error, and acknowledged she had been too
rash in censuring me; and growing pleased at my fresh professions of
love to her, we presently were reconciled, and became again very good
friends.

When Youwarkee had gathered strength again, she proved an excellent
nurse to my Pedro (for that was the name I gave him), so that he soon
grew a charming child, able to go in his twelvemonth, and spoke in his
twentieth. This and two other lovely boys I had by her in three years,
every one of which she brought up with the breast, and they thrived
delicately.

I don't mention the little intervening occurrences which happened
during this period; they consisted chiefly of the old rota of fishing,
watering, providing in the summer for the winter, and in managing my
salt-work; which altogether kept me at full employment, comfortably to
maintain an increasing family.

In this time I had found out several new sorts of eatables. I had
observed, as I said before, abundance of birds about the wood and lake
in the summer months. These, by firing at them two or three times on my
first coming, I had almost caused to desert my dominions. But as I had
for the last two or three years given no disturbance at all to them,
they were now in as great plenty as ever; and I made great profit of
them by the peace they enjoyed; and yet my table never wanted a supply,
fresh in the summer, or salted and pickled in winter.

I took notice it was about October these birds used to come; and most of
the month of November they were busy in laying their eggs, which I used
at that time to find in great plenty along the banks of the lake in the
reeds, and made great collections of them; I used also to find a great
many in the woods amongst the shrubs and underwood. These furnished our
table various ways; for with my cream-cheese flour, and a little mixture
of ram's-horn juice, I had taught my wife to make excellent puddings of
them; abundance of them also we ate boiled or fried alone, and often as
sauce to our fish. As for the birds themselves, having long omitted to
fire at them, I had an effectual means of taking them otherwise by nets,
which I set between the trees, and also very large pitfall nets, with
which I used to catch all sorts, even from the size of a thrush to that
of a turkey. But as I shall say more of these when I come to speak of my
ward by and by, and of my poultry, I shall omit any further mention of
them here.

You may perhaps wonder how I could keep an account of my time so
precisely, as to talk of the particular months. I will tell you. At my
coming from America, I was then exact; for we set sail the fourteenth of
November, and struck the first or second day of February. So far I kept
perfect reckoning; but after that I was not so exact, though I kept it
as well as my perplexity would admit even then, till the days shortening
upon me, prevented it.

Hereupon I set about making a year for myself. I found the duration of
the comparative darkness, or what might with me be termed night, in the
course of the twenty-four hours, or day, gradually increased for six
months; after which it decreased reciprocally for an equal time, and
the lighter part of the day took its turn, as in our parts of the world,
only inversely: so that as the light's decrease became sensible about
the middle of March, it was at the greatest pitch the latter end of
August, or beginning of September; and from thence, on the contrary,
went on decreasing to the close of February, when I had the longest
portion of light. Hereupon, dividing my year into two seasons only, I
began the winter half in March, and the summer half in September. Thus
my winter was the spring and summer quarters in Europe, and my summer
those of our autumn and winter.

From my settling this matter, I kept little account of days or weeks,
but only reckoned my time by summer and winter, so that I am pretty
right as to the revolutions of these; though the years, as to their
notation, I kept no account of, nor do I know what year of the Lord it
now is.


CHAPTER XIX.

     Wilkins's concern about clothing for Pedro, his eldest son--
     His discourse with his wife about the ship--Her flight to
     it--His melancholy reflections till her return--An account
     of what she had done, and of what she brought--She clothes
     her children, and takes a second flight

As my boy Pedro grew up, though, as I said before, he had the graundee,
yet it was of less dimensions than it ought to have been to be useful to
him, so that it was visible he could never fly; for it would scarce meet
before, whereas it ought to have reached from side to side both ways.
This pleased my wife to the heart; for now she was sure, whatever I
had done before, I could not suspect her. Be that as it will, the boy's
graundee not being a sufficient vestment for him, it became necessary he
should be clothed.

I turned over my hoard, but could find nothing that would do; or, at
least, that we knew how to fit him with. I had described my own country
vest for lads to Youwarkee, and she formed a tolerable idea of it, but
we had no tackle to alter anything with. "Oh, my dear," says I, "had I
but been born with the graundee, I need not be now racking my brains to
get my child clothes."--"What do you mean by that?" says she.--"Why,"
says I, "I would have flown to my ship (for I had long before related
to her all my sea adventures, till the vessel's coming to the magnetical
rock), and have brought some such things from thence, as you, not
wanting them in this country, can have no notion of." She seemed mighty
inquisitive to understand how a ship was made, what it was most like to,
how a person who never saw one might know it only by the description,
and how one might get into it; with abundance of the like questions.
She then inquired what sort of things those needles and several other
utensils were, which I had at times been speaking of; and in what
part of a ship they usually kept such articles. And I, to gratify her
curiosity, as I perceived she took a pleasure in hearing me, answered
all her questions to a scruple; not then conceiving the secret purpose
of all this inquisitiveness.

About two days after this, having been out two or three hours in the
morning, to cut wood, at coming home I found Pedro crying, ready
to break his heart, and his little brother Tommy hanging to him and
crawling about the floor after him: the youngest pretty baby was fast
asleep upon one of the beast-fish skins, in a corner of the room. I
asked Pedro for his mother; but the poor infant had nothing farther to
say to the matter, than "Mammy run away, I cry! mammy run away, I
cry!" I wondered where she was gone, never before missing her from our
habitation. However, I waited patiently till bed-time, but no wife.
I grew very uneasy then; yet, as my children were tired and sleepy, I
thought I had best go to bed with them, and make quiet; so, giving all
three their suppers, we lay down together. They slept; but my mind was
too full to permit the closure of my eyes. A thousand different chimeras
swam in my imagination relating to my wife. One while I fancied her
carried away by her kinsfolks; then, that she was gone of her own accord
to make peace with her father. But that thought would not fix, being put
aside by her constant tenderness to her children and regard to me, whom
I was sure she would not have left without notice. "But alas!" says I,
"she may even now be near me, but taken so ill she cannot get home, or
she may have died suddenly in the wood." I lay tumbling and tossing in
great anxiety, not able to find out any excusable occasion she could
have of so long absence. And then, thinks I, if she should either be
dead, or have quite left me, which will be of equally bad consequence
to me, what can I do with three poor helpless infants? If they were a
little more grown up, they might be helpful to me and to each other;
but at their age how shall I ever rear them without the tenderness of
a mother? And to see them pine away before my face, and not know how to
help them, will distract me.

Finding I could neither sleep nor lie still, I rose, intending to search
all the woods about, and call to her, that if any accident had prevented
sight of her she might at least hear me. But upon opening the door, and
just stepping out, how agreeably was I surprised to meet her coming in,
with something on her arm. "My dear Youwarkee," says I, "where have you
been? What has befallen you to keep you out so long? The poor children
have been at their wits' end to find you; and I, my dear, have been
inconsolable, and was now, almost distracted, coming in search of you."
Youwarkee looked very blank, to think what concern she had given me and
the children. "My dearest Peter," says she, kissing me, "pray forgive
me the only thing I have ever done to offend you, and the last cause
you shall ever have, by my good will, to complain of me; but walk within
doors, and I will give you a farther account of my absence. Don't you
remember what delight I took the other day to hear you talk of your
ship?"--"Yes," says I, "you did so; but what of that?"--"Nay, pray,"
says she, "forgive me, for I have been to see it."--"That's impossible,"
says I; and truly this was the first time I ever thought she went about
to deceive me.--"I do assure you," says she, "I have; and a wonderful
thing it is! But if you distrust me, and what I say, I have brought
proof of it; step out with me to the verge of the wood, and satisfy
yourself."--"But pray," says I, "who presented you with this upon your
arm?"--"I vow," says she, "I had forgot this: yes, this will, I believe,
confirm to you what I have said."--I turned it over and over; and
looking wistfully upon her, says I, "This waistcoat, indeed, is the very
fellow to one that lay in the captain's locker in the cabin"--"Say not
the very fellow," says she, "but rather say the very same, for I'll
assure you it is so; and had you been with me, we might have got so many
things for ourselves and the children, we should never have wanted
more, though we had lived these hundred years; but as it is, I have left
something without the wood for you to bring up." When we had our talk
out, she, hearing the children stir, took them up, and was going, as she
always did, to get their breakfasts. "Hold," says I, "this journey must
have fatigued you too much already; lay yourself to rest, and leave
everything else to me."--"My dear," says she, "you seem to think this
flight tiresome, but you are mistaken; I am more weary with walking to
the lake and back again, than with all the rest. Oh," says she, "if you
had but the graundee, flying would rest you, after the greatest labour;
for the parts which are moved with exercise on the earth, are all at
rest in flight; as, on the contrary, the parts used in flight are when
on earthly travel. The whole trouble of flight is in mounting from
the plain ground; but when once you are upon the graundee at a proper
height, all the rest is play, a mere trifle; you need only think of your
way, and incline to it, your graundee directs you as readily as your
feet obey you on the ground, without thinking of every step you take; it
does not require labour, as your boat does, to keep you a-going."

After we had composed ourselves, we walked to the verge of the wood, to
see what cargo my wife had brought from the ship. I was astonished at
the bulk of it; and seeing, by the outside, it consisted of clothes, I
took it with much ado upon my shoulders and carried it home. But upon
opening it, I found far more treasure than I could have imagined; for
there was a hammer, a great many spikes and nails, three spoons, about
five plates of pewter, four knives and a fork, a small china punchbowl,
two chocolate cups, a paper of needles, and several of pins, a parcel
of coarse thread, a pair of shoes, and abundance of such other things
as she had heard me wish for and describe; besides as much linen and
woollen, of one sort or another, as made a good package for all the
other things; with a great tin porridge-pot, of about two gallons, tied
to the outside; and all these as nicely stowed as if she had been bred a
packer.

When I had viewed the bundle, and poised the weight, "How was it
possible, my dear You-warkee," said I, "for you to bring all this?
You could never carry them in your hands."--"No, no," replied she, "I
carried them on my back."--"Is it possible," says I, "for your graundee
to bear yourself and all this weight too in the air, and to such a
height as the top of these rocks?"--"You will always," replies she,
"make the height a part of your difficulty in flying; but you are
deceived, for as the first stroke (I have heard you say often) in
fighting is half the battle, so it is in flying; get but once fairly on
the wind, nothing can hurt you afterwards. My method, let me tell you,
was this; I climbed to the highest part of the ship, where I could stand
clear, having first put up my burden, which you have there; and then
getting that on my back near my shoulders, I took the two cords you see
hang loose to it in my two hands, and extending my graundee, leaped off
flatwise with my face towards the water; when instantly playing two or
three good strokes with my graundee, I was out of danger; now, if I
had found the bundle too heavy to make my first strokes with, I should
directly have turned on my back, dropped my bundle, and floated in my
graundee to the ship again, as you once saw me float on the lake." Says
I, "You must have flown a prodigious distance to the lake, for I was
several days sailing, I believe three weeks, from my ship, before I
reached the gulf; and after that could be little less than five weeks
(as I accounted for it), and at a great rate of sailing too under the
rock, before I reached the lake; so that the ship must be a monstrous
way off." "No, no," says she, "your ship lies but over yon cliff, that
rises as it were with two points; and as to the rock itself, it is not
broader than our lake is long; but what made you so tedious in your
passage was many of the windings and turnings in the cavern returning
in to themselves again; so that you might have gone round and round
till this time, if the tide had not luckily struck you into the direct
passage: this," says she, "I have heard from some of my countrymen, who
have flown up it, but could never get quite through."

"I wish with all my heart," says I, "fortune had brought me first to
light in this country; or (but for your sake I could almost say) had
never brought me into it at all; for to be a creature of the
least significancy, of the whole race but one, is a melancholy
circumstance."--"Fear not," says she, "my love, for you have a wife will
hazard all for you, though you are restrained; and as my inclinations
and affections are so much yours, that I need but know your desires
to execute them as far as my power extends, surely you, who can act by
another, may be content to forego the trouble of your own performance. I
perceive, indeed," continued she, "you want mightily to go to your ship,
and are more uneasy now you know it is safe than you was before; but
that being past my skill to assist you in, if you will command your
deputy to go backwards and forwards in your stead, I am ready to obey
you."

Thus ended our conversation about the ship for that time. But it left
not my mind so soon; for a stronger hankering after it pursued me now
than ever since my wife's flight, but to no purpose.

We sat us down and sorted out our cargo, piece by piece; and having
found several things proper for the children, my wife longed to enter
upon some piece of work towards clothing Pedro in the manner she
had heard me talk of, and laid hard at me to show her the use of the
needles, thread, and other things she had brought. Indeed I must say
she proved very tractable; and from the little instruction I was able to
give her, soon out-wrought my knowledge; for I could only show her that
the thread went through the needle, and both through the cloth to hold
it together; but for anything else I was as ignorant as she. In much
less time than I could have imagined, she had clothed my son Pedro, and
had made a sort of mantle for the youngest. But now seeing us so smart
(for I took upon me sometimes to wear the green waistcoat she had
brought under my dirty jacket), she began to be ashamed of herself, as
she said, in our fine company; and afterwards (as I shall soon acquaint
you) got into our fashion.

Seeing the advantages her flight to the ship, and that so many
conveniences arose from it, she was frequently at me to let her go
again. I should as much have wished for another return of goods as she,
but I could by no means think of parting with my factor; for I knew her
eagerness to please me, and that she would stick at nothing to perform
it. And, thinks I, should any accident happen to her, by over-loading or
otherwise, and I should lose her, all the other commodities of the
whole world put together would not compensate her loss. But as she so
earnestly desired it, and assured me she would run no hazards, I was
prevailed on at length, by her incessant importunities, to let her go;
though under certain restrictions which she promised me to comply with.
As first, I insisted upon it that she should take a tour quite round
the rock, setting out the same way I had last gone with my boat; and, if
possible, find out the gulf, which I told her she could not mistake,
by reason of the noise the fall of the water made; and desired her to
remark the place, so as I might know within-side where it was without.
And then I told her she might review and search every hole in the ship
as she pleased; and if there were any small things she had a mind to
bring from it, she was welcome, provided the bundle she should make up
was not above a fourth part either of the bulk or weight of the last.
All which she having engaged punctually to observe, she bade me not
expect her till I saw her, and she would return as soon as possible. I
then went with her to the confines of the wood (for I told her I desired
to see her mount), and she, after we had embraced, bidding me to stand
behind her, took her flight.


CHAPTER XX.

     The Author observes her flight--A description of a glumm
     in the graundee--She finds out the gulf not far from the
     ship--Brings home more goods--Makes her a gown by her
     husband's instruction

I had ever since our marriage been desirous of seeing Youwarkee fly;
but this was the first opportunity I had of it; and indeed the sight was
worthy of all the attention I paid it; for I desired her slowly to put
herself in proper order for it, that I might make my observation
the more accurately; and shall now give you an account of the whole
apparatus, though several parts of the description were taken from
subsequent views; for it would have been impossible to have made just
remarks of everything at that once, especially as I only viewed her back
parts then.

I told you before, I had seen her graundee open, and quite extended as
low as her middle; but that being in the grotto by lamplight, I could
not take so just a survey as now, when the sort of light we ever had was
at the brightest.

She first threw up two long branches or ribs of the whalebone, as
I called it before (and indeed for several of its properties, as
toughness, elasticity, and pliableness, nothing I have ever seen can so
justly be compared to it), which were jointed behind to the upper bone
of the spine, and which, when not extended, lie bent over the shoulders
on each side of the neck forwards, from whence, by nearer and nearer
approaches, they just meet at the lower rim of the belly in a sort
of point; but when extended, they stand their whole length above the
shoulders, not perpendicularly, but spreading outwards, with a web of
the softest and most pliable and springy membrane that can be imagined,
in the interstice between them, reaching from their root or joint on the
back up above the hinder part of the head, and near half-way their own
length; but when closed, the membrane falls down in the middle upon the
neck, like a handkerchief. There are also two other ribs rising as it
were from the same root, which, when open, run horizontally, but not so
long as the others. These are filled up in the interstice between them
and the upper ones with the same membrane; and on the lower side of
this is also a deep flap of the membrane, so that the arms can be either
above or below it in flight, and are always above it when closed. This
last rib, when shut, flaps under the upper one, and also falls down with
it before to the waist, but is not joined to the ribs below. Along the
whole spine-bone runs a strong, flat, broad, grisly cartilage, to which
are joined several other of these ribs; all which open horizontally, and
are filled in the interstices with the above membrane, and are jointed
to the ribs of the person just where the plane of the back begins to
turn towards the breast and belly; and, when shut, wrap the body round
to the joints on the contrary side, folding neatly one side over the
other. At the lower spine are two more ribs, extended horizontally when
open, jointed again to the hips, and long enough to meet the joint on
the contrary side cross the belly; and from the hip-joint, which is on
the outermost edge of the hip-bone, runs a pliable cartilage quite down
the outside of the thigh and leg to the ankle; from which there branch
out divers other ribs horizontally also when open, but when closed, they
encompass the whole thigh and leg, rolling inwards cross the back of
the leg and thigh till they reach and just cover the cartilage. The
interstices of these are also filled up with the same membrane. From the
two ribs which join to the lower spine-bone, there hangs down a sort
of short apron, very full of plaits, from hip-joint to hip-joint, and
reaches below the buttocks, half-way or more to the hams. This has also
several small limber ribs in it. Just upon the lower spine-joint, and
above the apron, as I call it, there are two other long branches, which,
when close, extend upon the back from the point they join at below to
the shoulders, where each rib has a clasper, which reaching over the
shoulders, just under the fold of the uppermost branch or ribs, hold
up the two ribs flat to the back like a V, the interstices of which are
also filled up with the aforesaid membrane. This last piece, in flight,
falls down almost to the ankles, where the two claspers lapping under
each leg within-side, hold it very fast; and then also the short apron
is drawn up by-the strength of the ribs in it, between the thighs
forward, and covers the pudenda and groin as far as the rim of the
belly. The whole arms are covered also from the shoulders to the wrist
with the same delicate membrane, fastened to ribs of proportionable
dimensions, and jointed to a cartilage on the outside in the same manner
as on the legs.

It is very surprising to feel the difference of these ribs when open and
when closed; for, closed, they are as pliable as the finest whalebone,
or more so, but when extended, are as strong and stiff as a bone. They
are tapering from the roots, and are broader or narrower as best suits
the places they occupy, and the stress they are put to, up to their
points, which are almost as small as a hair. The membrane between them
is the most elastic thing I ever met with, occupying no more space, when
the ribs are closed, than just from rib to rib, as flat and smooth
as possible; but when extended in some postures, will dilate itself
surprisingly. This will be better comprehend by the plates, where you
will see several figures of glumms and gawrys in different attitudes,
than can be expressed by words.

As soon as my wife had expanded the whole graundee, being upon plain
ground, she stooped forward, moving with a heavy wriggling motion at
first, which put me into some pain for her; but after a few strokes,
beginning to rise a little, she cut through the air like lightning, and
was soon over the edge of the rock and out of my sight.

It is the most amazing thing in the world to observe the large expansion
of this graundee when open; and when closed (as it all is in a moment
upon the party's descent) to see it sit so close and compact to the
body, as no tailor can come up to it; and then the several ribs lie so
justly disposed in the several parts, that instead of being, as one
would imagine, a disadvantage to the shape, they make the body and limbs
look extremely elegant; and by the different adjustment of their lines
on the body and limbs, the whole, to my fancy, somewhat resembles the
dress of the old Roman warriors in their buskins; and, to appearance,
seems much more noble than any fictitious garb I ever saw, or can frame
a notion of to myself.

Though these people, in height, shape, and limb, very much resemble the
Europeans, there is yet this difference, that their bodies are rather
broader and flatter, and their limbs, though as long and well shaped,
are seldom as thick as ours. And this I observed generally in all I saw
of them during a long time among them afterwards; but their skin, for
beauty and fairness, exceeds ours very much.

My wife having now taken her second flight, I went home, and never left
my children till her return; this was three days after our parting. I
was in bed with my little ones when she knocked at the door. I soon let
her in, and we received each other with a glowing welcome. The news she
brought me was very agreeable. She told me she first went and pried into
every nook in the ship, where she had seen such things, could we get at
them, as would make us very happy. Then she set out the way I told her
to go, in order to find the gulf. She was much afraid she should not
have discovered it, though she flew very slow, that she might be sure
to hear the waterfall and not over-shoot it. It was long ere she came
at it; but when she did, she perceived she might have spared most of her
trouble, had she set out the other way; for, after she had flown almost
round the island, and not before, she began to hear the fall, and upon
coming up to it, found it to be not above six minutes' flight from the
ship. She said the entrance was very narrow, and, she thought, lower
than I represented it; for she could scarce discern any space between
the surface of the water and the arch-way of the rock. I told her that
might happen from the rise or fall of the sea itself. But I was glad to
hear the ship was no farther from the gulf; for my head was never free
from the thoughts of my ship and cargo. She then told me she had left
a small bundle for me without the wood, and went to look after her
children. I brought up the bundle, and though it was not near so large
as the other, I found several useful things in it, wrapped up in four
or five yards of dark blue woollen cloth, which I knew no name for, but
which was thin and light, and about a yard wide. I asked her where she
met with this stuff; she answered, where there was more of it, under a
thing like our bed, in a cloth like our sheet, which she cut open,
and took it out of.--"Well," says I, "and what will you do with
this?"--"Why, I will make me a coat like yours," says she, "for I don't
like to look different from my dear husband and children."--"No,
Youwarkee," replied I, "you must not do so; if you make such a jacket as
mine, there will be no distinction between glumm and gawry;* the gowren
praave,** in my country, would not on any account go dressed like a
glumm; for they wear a fine flowing garment called a gown, that sits
tight about the waist, and hangs down from thence in folds, like your
barras, *** almost to the ground, so that you can hardly discern their
feet, and no other part of their body but their hands and face, and
about as much of their neck and breasts as you see in your graundee."

     * Man and woman.

     ** Modest women.

     ***The back flap of the graundee.

Youwarkee seemed highly delighted with this new-fancied dress, and
worked day and night at it against the cold weather. Whilst she employed
herself thus, I was busied in providing my winter stores, which I was
forced to do alone now, herself and children taking up all my wife's
time. About a fortnight after she had begun mantua-making, she presented
herself to me one day, as I came from work, in her new gown; and, truly,
considering the scanty description I had given her of such a garment,
it appeared a good comely dress. Though it had not one plait about the
body, it sat very tight thereto, and yet hung down full enough for a
countess; for she would have put it all in (all the stuff she had) had
there been as much more of it. I could see no opening before, so asked
her how she got it on. She told me she laid along on the ground, and
crept through the plaits at the bottom, and sewed the body round her
after she had got her hands and arms through the sleeves. I wondered at
her contrivance; and, smiling, showed her how she should put it on, and
also how to pin it before: and after she had done that, and I had turned
up about half a yard of sleeve, which then hung down to her fingers'
ends, I kissed her, and called her my country-woman; of which, and her
new gown, she was very proud for a long time.


CHAPTER XXI.

     The Author gets a breed of poultry, and by what means--
     Builds them a house--How he managed to keep them in winter

One day, as I was traversing the woods to view my bird-traps, looking
into the underwood among the great trees on my right hand, I saw a
wood-hen (a bird I used to call so, from its resemblance in make to our
English poultry) come out of a little thicket. I know not whether my
rustling or what had disturbed it; but I let her pass, and she ran away
before me. When she was fairly out of sight, I stepped up, and found
she had a nest and sixteen eggs there. I exactly marked the place, and
taking away one of the eggs, I broke it, at some distance from the nest,
to see how forward they were; and I had no sooner broke the shell but
out came a young chicken. I then looked into the nest again, and taking
up more of the eggs, I found them all just splintered in the shell, and
ready for hatching. I had immediately a desire to save them, and bring
them up tame; but I was afraid if I took them away before they were
hatched, and a little strengthened under the hen, they would all die; so
I let them remain till next day. In the meanwhile I prepared some small
netting of such a proper size as I conceived would do, and with this
I contrived, by fastening it to stakes which I fixed in the ground,
to surround the nest, and me on the outside of it. All the while I was
doing this, the hen did not stir, so that I thought she had either been
absent when I came, or had hatched and gone off with the young ones. As
to her being gone I was under no concern; for I had no design to
catch her, but only to confine the chickens within my net if they were
hatched. But, however, I went nearer, and peeping in, found she sat
still, squeezing herself as flat to the ground as she could. I was in
twenty minds whether to take her first, and then catch the chickens, or
to let her go off, and then clap upon them; but as I proposed to let her
go, I thought if she would sit still till I had got the chickens, that
would be the best way; so I softly kneeled down before her, and sliding
my hand under her, I gently drew out two, and put them in a bag I had in
my left hand. I then dipped again and again, taking two every turn; but
going a fourth time, as I was bringing out my prize, the hen jumped up,
flew out, and made such a noise that, though I the minute before saw six
or seven more chicks in a lump where she had sat, and kept my eye upon
them, yet before I could put the last two I had got into my bag, these
were all gone, and in three hours' search I could not find one of them,
though I was sure they could not pass my net, and must be within the
compass of a small room, my toils enclosing no more. After tiring myself
with looking for them, I marched home with those eight I had got.

I told Youwarkee what I had done, and how I intended to manage the
little brood, and, if I could, to bring them up tame. We kept them some
days very warm by the fire, and fed them often, as I had seen my mother
do with her early chickens; and in a fortnight's time they were as stout
and familiar as common poultry. We kept them a long while in the house;
and when I fed them I always used them to a particular whistle, which
I also taught my wife, that they might know both us and their
feeding-time; and in a very short while they would come running, upon
the usual sound, like barn-door fowls to the name of Biddy.

There happened in this brood to be five hens and three cocks; and they
were now so tame that, having cut their wings, I let them out, when the
weather favoured, at my door, where they would pick about in the wood,
and get the best part of their subsistence; and having used them to
roost in a corner of my ante-chamber, they all came in very regularly
at night and took their places. My hens, at the usual season, laid me
abundance of eggs, and hatched me a brood or two each of chickens; so
that now I was at a loss to know what to do with them, they were become
so numerous. The ante-chamber was no longer a proper receptacle of such
a flock, and therefore I built a little house, at a small distance from
my own, on purpose for their reception and entertainment. I had by this
time cleared a spot of ground on one side of my grotto, by burning up
the timber and underwood which had covered it: this I enclosed, and
within that enclosure I raised my aviary, and my poultry thrived very
well there, seemed to like their habitation, and grew very fat.

My wife and I took much delight in visiting and feeding them, and it was
a fine diversion also to my boys; but at the end of summer, when all
the other birds took their annual flight, away went every one of my
new-raised brood with them, and one of my old cocks, the rest of the old
set remaining very quiet with me all the winter. The next summer, when
my chicks of that year grew up a little, I cut their wings, and by that
means preserved all but one, which I suppose was either not cut so close
as the rest, or his wings had grown again. From this time I found, by
long experience, that not two out of a hundred that had once wintered
with me would ever go away, though I did not cut their wings; but all of
the same season would certainly go off with the wild ones, if they could
any ways make a shift to fly. I afterwards got a breed of blacknecks,
which was a name I gave them from the peculiar blackness of their necks,
let the rest of their bodies be of what colour they would, as they
are, indeed, of all colours. These birds were as big, or bigger, than a
turkey, of a delicious flavour, and were bred from turkey eggs hatched
under my own wood-hens in great plenty. I was forced to clip these as
I did the other young fowl, to keep them, and at length they grew very
tame, and would return every night during the dark season. The greatest
difficulty now was to get meat for all these animals in the winter, when
they would sit on the roost two days together if I did not call and feed
them, which I was sometimes forced to do by lamp-light, or they would
have starved in cloudy weather. But I overcame that want of food by an
accidental discovery; for I observed my blacknecks in the woods jump
many times together at a sort of little round heads, or pods, very dry,
which hung plentifully upon a shrub that grew in great abundance there.
I cut several of these heads, and carrying them home with me, broke
them, and took out a spoonful or more from each head of small yellow
seeds, which giving to my poultry, and finding they greedily devoured
them, I soon laid in a stock for twice my number of mouths, so that they
never after wanted. I tried several times to raise a breed of water-fowl
by hatching their eggs under my hens; but not one in ten of the sorts,
when hatched, were fit to eat; and those that were would never live
and thrive with me, but go away to the lake, I having no sort of water
nearer me; so I dropped my design of water-fowl as impracticable. But by
breeding and feeding my land-fowl so constantly in my farmyard, I never
wanted of that sort at my table, where we eat abundance of them; for my
whole side of the lake in a few years was like a farmyard, so full of
poultry that I never knew my stock; and upon the usual whistle they
would flock round me from all quarters. I had everything now but cattle,
not only for the support, but convenience and pleasure of life; and so
happily should I have fared here, if I had had but a cow and bull, a ram
and sheep, that I would not have changed my dominions for the crown of
England.


CHAPTER XXII.

     Reflections on mankind--The Author wants to be with his
     ship--Projects going, but perceives it impracticable--
     Youwarkee offers her service y and goes--An account of her
     transactions on board-Remarks on her sagacity--She
     despatches several chests of goods through the gulf to the
     lake--An account of a danger she escaped--The Author has a
     fit of sickness

Strange is the temper of mankind, who, the more they enjoy, the
more they covet. Before I received any return from my ship, I rested
tolerably easy, and but seldom thought upon what I had left behind me
in her, thinking myself happy in what I had, and completely so since
my union with my dear wife; but after I had got what I could never
have expected, I grew more and more perplexed for want of the rest, and
thought I should never enjoy true happiness while even a plank of the
ship remained. My head, be I where I would, or at what I would, was ever
on board. I wished for her in the lake, and could I but have got her
thither, I thought I should be an emperor; and though I wanted for
nothing to maintain life, and had so good a wife and five children I was
very fond of, yet the one thing I had not, reduced the comfort of all
the rest to a scanty pattern, even so low as to destroy my whole peace.
I was even mad enough to think of venturing up the cavern again, but was
restrained from the attempt by the certain impracticableness of it Then
I thought Youwarkee should make another trip to the ship. But what can
she bring from it, says I to myself, in respect of what must be left
behind? Her whole life will not suffice to clear it in, at the rate she
can fetch the loading hither in parcels. At last a project started, that
as there were so many chests on board, Youwarkee should fill some of
them and send them through the gulf to take their chance for the lake.
This, at first sight, seemed feasible; but then I considered how they
could be got from the ship to the gulf; and again, that they would never
keep out the water, and if they filled with a lading in them they would
sink; or, if this did not happen, they might be dashed to pieces against
the crags in the cavern. These apprehensions stopped me again; till,
unwilling to quit the thought, "True," says I, "this may happen to some;
but if I get but one in five, it is better than nothing." Thus I turned
and wound the affair in my mind; but objections still started too
obstinate to be conquered.

In the height of my soliloquy in comes Youwarkee, and seeing my dejected
look, would needs know the meaning of it I told her plainly that I could
get no rest from day to day ever since she first went to the ship, to
think such a number of good things lay there to be a prey to the sea, as
the ship wasted, when they might be of such infinite service here; and
that, since her last flight, I had suffered the more, when I thought how
near the gulf was to the ship; so that could I but get thither myself
with my boat, I would contrive to pack up the goods in the chests that
were on board, and carrying them in the boat, drop them near the draught
of the water, which of itself would suck them under the rock down the
gulf; and when they were passed through the cavern, I might take them
up in the lake. "Well," says she, "Peter, and why cannot I do this for
you?"--"No," says I, "even this has its objections." Then I told her
what I feared of their taking water, or dashing against the rock, and
twenty other ways of frustrating my views: "But, above all," says I,
"how can you get such large and weighty things to the gulf without a
boat? There is another impossibility! it won't do."

Youwarkee eyed me attentively. "Pr'ythee, my dear Peter," says she, "set
your heart at rest about that. I can only try; if no good is to be
done, you shall soon know it, and must rest contented under the
disappointment."--I told her if I was there, I could take all the things
out of the chests, and then melt some pitch and pour into every crack,
to keep out the water when they were set afloat. "Pitch!" says she,
"what's that?"--"Why," says I, "that is a nasty, hard, black sticking
thing that stands in tubs in the ship, and which being put over the fire
in anything to melt will grow liquid, and when it is cold be hard again,
and will resist the water and keep it out."--Says she, "How can I put
this pitch within-side of the chest-lid when I have tied it up?"--"It is
to no manner of purpose," says I, "to talk of it; so there's an end of
it."--"But," says she, "suppose yourself there, what things would you
bring first?"--I then entered into a long detail of particulars; saying
I would have this and that, and so on, till I had scarce left out a
thing I either knew of or could suppose to be in the ship; and for fear
I had not mentioned all, says I at last, if I was there, I believe I
should leave but little portable behind me.

"So, so, my dear," says Youwarkee, "you would roll in riches, I find;
but you have mentioned never a new gown for me."--"Why, aye!" says I,
"I would have that too."--"But how would you melt the pitch?" says
she.--"Oh," says I, "there is a tinder-box and matches in a room below,
upon the side of the fire-hearth." And then I let her see one I had
brought with me, and showed her the use of the flint and steel.--"Well,
my dear," says she, "will you once more trust me?"--I told her, her
going would be of little more use than to get a second gown or some such
thing; but if she was desirous, I would let her make another flight, on
her promise to be back as soon as possible.

In the evening she set out, and stayed two days, and till the night
of the third. I would here observe that though it was much lighter and
brighter on the outside of the rock where the ship lay than with us at
Graundevolet, yet having always her spectacles with her, I heard no
more complaint of the glare of light she used to be so much afraid of:
indeed, she always avoided the fire and lamp at home as much as she
could, because she generally took off her spectacles within doors; but
when at any time she had them on, she could bear both well enough.

Upon her return again, she told me she had shipped some goods to sea for
me, which she hoped would arrive safe (for by this time she had had my
seafaring terms so often over, she could apply them very properly),
and that they were in six chests, which she had pitched after my
directions.--"Aye!" says I, "you have pitched them into the sea perhaps;
but after my directions, I am satisfied was beyond your ability."--"You
glumms," says she, "think us gawrys very ignorant; but I'll satisfy you
we are not so dull of apprehension as you would make us. Did you not
show me one day how your boat was tarred and caulked, as you call
it?"--"I did," says I; "what then?"--"I'll tell you," says she. "When
I had emptied the first chest, and set it properly, I looked about for
your pitch, which at last I found by its sticking to my fingers; I then
put a good piece into a sort of little kettle, with a long handle, that
lay upon the pitch."--"Oh, the pitch-ladle!" says I.--"I know not what
you call it," says she; "but then I made a fire, as you told me, and
melted that stuff; afterwards turning up the chest side-ways, and then
end-ways, I poured it into it, and let it settle in the cracks, and with
an old stocking, such as yours, dipped into the pitch, I rubbed every
place where the boards joined. I then set the chest on the side of the
ship, and when the pitch was cold and hardened in it, filled it top-full
of things: but when I had done thus, and shut the lid, I found that
would not come so close but I could get the blade of a knife through
anywhere between it and the chest; whereupon I cut some long slips of
the cloth I was packing up, and fitting them all round the edge of the
chest, I dipped them into the pitch, and laid them on hot; and where one
slip would not do, I put two; and shutting the lid down close upon them,
I nailed it, as I had seen you do some things, quite round; then tying a
rope to the handle, I tipped the chest into the sea, holding the rope.
I watched it some time, and seeing it swim well, I took flight with the
rope in my hand, and drew the chest after me to the gulf, when, letting
go the rope, away it went. I served five more in the same manner: and
now, my dearest, I am here to tell you I hope you will be able to see at
least some of them, one time or other, in the lake."

I admired in all this at the sagacity of the gawrys. Alas! thinks I,
what narrow-hearted creatures are mankind! Did I not heretofore look
upon the poor blacks in Africa as little better than beasts, till my
friend Glanlepze convinced me, by disabling the crocodile, the passage
of the river, and several other achievements, that my own excellences
might have perished in a desert without his genius; and now what
could I, or almost any of us masterpieces of the creation (as we think
ourselves) and Heaven's peculiar favourites, have done in this present
case, that has been omitted by this woman (for I may justly style her so
in an eminent degree), and that in a way to which she was bred an utter
stranger?

After what I had heard from Youwarkee, I grew much more cheerful;
which she, poor creature, was remarkably pleased with. She went with me
constantly once, and sometimes twice a day, for several days together,
to see what success at the lake; till at length she grew very impatient,
for fear, as she afterwards told me, I should either think she had not
done what she said, or had done it in an ineffectual manner. But one
day, walking by the lake, I thought I saw something floating in the
water at a very great distance. "Youwarkee," says I, "I spy a sail!"
Then running to my boat* and taking her in, away we went, plying my oars
with all my might; for I longed to see what it was. At nearer view
I perceived it to be one of my wife's fleet. But what added to my
satisfaction was to see Youwarkee so pleased, for she could scarcely
contain herself.

When we came close to it, up she started: "Now, my dear Peter," says
she, "torment yourself no more about your goods on board; for if this
will do, all shall be your own."--She then lent me a hand to take it
in; but we had both work enough to compass it, the wood had soaked in so
much water. We then made the best of our way homewards to my wet-dock;
when, just as we had landed our treasure, we saw two more boxes coming
down the stream both together, whereupon we launched again, and brought
them in one by one; for I did not care to trust them both on one bottom,
my boat being in years, and growing somewhat crazy.

We had now made a good day's work of it; so, mooring the boat, we went
home, intending to be out next morning early with the cart, to convey
our imports to the grotto.

After supper, Youwarkee looking very earnestly at me, with tears just
glittering in her eyes, broke out in these words--"What should you
have thought, Peter, to have seen me come sailing, drowned, through the
cavern, tied to one of your chests?"--"Heaven forbid such a thought, my
charmer!" says I. "But as you know I must have been rendered the most
miserable of all living creatures by such a sight, or anything else that
would deprive me of you, pray tell me how you could possibly have such a
thought in your head?"--She saw she had raised my concern, and was very
sorry for what she had said. "Nothing, nothing," says she, "my dear!
it was only a fancy just come into my head."--"My dear Youwee," says I,
"you must let me know what you mean: I am in great pain till you explain
yourself; for I am sure there is something more in what you say
than fancy; therefore, pray, if you love me, keep me on the rack no
longer."--"Ah, Peter!" says she, "there was but a span between me and
death not many days ago; and when I saw the line of the last chest we
took up just now, it gave so much horror I could scarce keep upon my
feet."--"My dear Youwee, proceed," says I; "for I cannot bear my torment
till I have heard the worst."--"Why, Peter," says she, "now the danger
is over, I shall tell you my escape with as much pleasure as I guess
you will take in hearing of it. You must know, my life," says she, "that
having cast that chest into the sea, as I was tugging it along by
that very line, it being one of the heaviest, and moving but slowly, I
twisted the string several times round my hand, one fold upon another,
the easier to tow it; when, drawing it rather too quick into the eddy,
it pulled so hard against me, towards the gulf, and so quick, that I
could in no way loosen or disengage the cord from my fingers, but
was dragged thereby to the very rock, against which the chest struck
violently. My last thought, as I supposed it, was of you, my dear" (on
which she clasped me round the neck, in sense of her past agony); "when
taking myself for lost, I forbore further resistance; at which instant
the line, slackening by the rebound of the chest, fell from my hand of
itself, and the chest returning to the rock, went down the current. I
took a turn or two round on my graundee to recollect my past danger, and
went back to the ship, fully resolved to avoid the like snare for the
future. Indeed I did not easily recover my spirits, and was so terrified
with the thought, that I had half a mind to have left the two remaining
chests behind me; but as danger overcome gives fresh resolution, I again
set to work, and discharged them also down the gulf, as I hope you will
see in good time."

My heart bled within me all the while she spoke, and I even felt
ten times more than she could have suffered by the gulf. "My dearest
Youwee," says I, "why did you not tell me this adventure sooner?" "It is
too soon, I fear, now!" says she; for she then saw the colour forsake
my lips, my eyes grow languid, and myself dropping into her arms. She
screamed out, and ran to the chest, where all was empty; but turning
every bottle up, and from the remaining drops in each collecting a small
quantity of liquor, and putting it by little and little to my lips, and
rubbing my wrists and temples, she brought me to myself again; but I
continued so extremely sick for some days after, that it was above a
week before I could get down with my cart to fetch up my chests.

When I was able to go down, Youwarkee would not venture me alone, but
went herself with me. We then found two more of the chests, which we
landed; and I had work sufficient for two or three days in getting them
all up to the grotto, they were so heavy, and all the way through the
wood being up hill.

We had five in hand, and watched several days for the sixth, when seeing
nothing of it we gave it over for lost; but one day, as I was going for
water, Youwarkee would go with me, and urged our carrying the net, that
we might drag for some fish. Accordingly we did so; and now having taken
what we wanted, we went to the rill, and pushing in the head of the boat
(as I usually did, for by that means I could fill the vessel as I stood
on board), the first thing that appeared was my sixth chest. Youwarkee
spied it first, and cried, pointing thereto, "O Peter, what we have long
wished for, and almost despaired of, is come at last! let us meet and
welcome it." I was pleased with the gaiety of her fancy. I did as she
desired; we got it into the boat, after merrily saluting it, and so
returned home. It took us up several days time in searching, sorting,
and disposing our cargo, and drying the chests; for the goods themselves
were so far from being wetted or spoiled, that even those in the last
chest, which had lain so long in the water, had not taken the least
moisture.

Youwarkee was quite alert at the success of her packing, but left me
to ring her praises, which I did not fail of doing more than once at
unpacking each chest, and could see her eyes glow with delight to see
she had so pleased me.

She had been so curious as to examine almost everything in the ship; and
as well of things I had described, and she did know, as of what she did
not, brought me something for a sample; but, above all, had not forgot
the blue stuff, for the moment she had seen that she destined it to the
use of herself and children.


CHAPTER XXIII.

     The religion of the author's family.

Youwarkee and I having fixed ourselves, by degrees, into a settled rota
of action, began to live like Christians, having so great a quantity of
most sorts of necessaries about us. But I say we lived like Christians
on another account, for you must not think, after what I have said
before, that I and my family lived like heathens; no, I will assure
you, they by degrees knew all I knew, and that, with a little artificial
improvement, and a well-regulated disposition, I hoped, and did not
doubt, would carry them all to heaven. I would many a time have given
all my interest in the ship's cargo for a Bible; and a hundred times
grieved that I was not master of a pocket one, which I might have
carried everywhere about me. I never imagined there was one aboard, and
if there were, and You-warkee should find it, I supposed it would be in
Portuguese, which I knew little of, so it would be of small service to
me if I had it.

Since I am on the topic of religion, it may not be amiss, once for all,
to give you a small sketch of my religious proceedings after coming into
my new dominions. I have already told you that from my first stop at the
rock I had prayed constantly morning and evening, but I cannot say I did
it always with the same efficacy. However, my imperfect devotions were
not without good effect; and I am confident, wherever this course is
pursued with a right view, sooner or later the issue will prove the
same to others as I found it to myself; I mean, that mercies will be
remembered with more gratitude, and evils be more disregarded, and
become less burdensome; and surely the person whose case this is, must
necessarily enjoy the truest relish of life. As daily prayer was my
practice, in answer to it I obtained the greatest blessing and comfort
my solitude was capable of receiving; I mean my wife, whose character I
need not farther attempt to blazon in any faint colours of my own after
what has been already said, her acts having spoken her virtues beyond
all verbal description.

After we were married, as I call it--that is, after we had agreed to
become man and wife--I frequently prayed before her, and with her (for
by this time she understood a good deal of my language); at which,
though contrary to my expectation, she did not seem surprised, but
readily kneeled by and joined with me. This I liked very well; and upon
my asking her one day after prayer if she understood what I had been
doing (for I had a notion she did not)--"Yes, verily," says she, "you
have been making petitions to the image of the great Collwar."*--"Pray,"
says I (willing gently to lead her into a just sense of a Supreme
Being), "who is this Collwar? and where does He dwell?"--"He it is,"
says she, "that does all good and evil to us."--"Right," says I, "it
is in some measure so; but He cannot of Himself do evil, absolutely and
properly, as His own act"--"Yes," says she, "He can; for He can do all
that can be done; and as evil can be done, He can do it."--So quick a
reply startled me. Thinks I, she will run me aground presently; and from
being a doctor, as I fancied myself, I shall become but a pupil to my
own scholar. I then asked her where the great Collwar dwelt? She told
me in heaven, in a charming place.--"And can He know what we do?" says
I.--"Yes," replied she, "His image tells Him everything; and I have
prayed to His image, which I have often seen, and it is filled with so
much virtue that it is His second self; for there is only one of them
in the world who is so good: He gives several virtues to other images
of Himself, which are brought to Him, and put into His arms to breathe
upon; and the only thing I have ever regretted since I knew you is, that
I have not one of them here to comfort and bless us and our children."

     * God.

Though I was sorry for the oddity of her conceptions, I was almost glad
to find her so ignorant, and pleased myself with thinking that as she
had already a confused notion of a Supreme Power, I should soon have the
satisfaction of bringing her to a more rational knowledge of Him.

"Pray, Youwee," says I, "what is your God made of?"--"Why of clay," says
she, "finely painted, and looks so terrible he would make you tremble to
behold him."--"Do you think," says I, "that is the true Collwar's real
shape, if you could see Himself?" She told me yes, for that some of His
best servants had seen him, and took the representation from Himself.
"And pray, do you think He loves His best servants, as you call them,
and is kind to them?"--"You need not doubt it," says she.--"Why, then,"
replied I, "how came He to look so terrible upon them when they saw Him,
as you say they did? for I can see no reason, how terrible soever He
looks to others, why He should show Himself so to those He loves. I
should rather think, as you say He is kind to them, that He should have
two images, a placid one for His good, and a terrible one for His bad
servants; or else, who by seeing Him can tell whether He is pleased or
angry? for even you yourself, Youwee, when anything pleases you, have a
different look from that you have when you are angry, and little Pedro
can tell whether he does well or ill by your countenance; whereas,
if you made no distinction, but looked with the same face on all his
actions, he would as readily think he did well as ill in committing
a bad action." Youwarkee could not tell what to say to this, the fact
seeming against her.

I then asked her if she thought the image itself could hear her
petitions. She replied, "Yes."--"And can he," says I, "return you an
answer?"--She told me he only did that to his best servants.--"Did you
ever hear him do it?" says I. "For unless he can speak too, I should
much suspect his hearing; and you being one of his best servants, seeing
you love him, and pray heartily to him, why should you not hear him as
soon as others?"--"No," says she, "there are a great number of glumms
on purpose to serve him, pray for us to him, and receive his
answers."--"But to what purpose then," says I, "is your praying to him,
if their prayers will serve your turn?"--"Oh," says she, "the image
hears them sooner than us, and sends the petitions up to the great
Collwar, and lets Him know who makes them, and desires Him to let them
have what they want."--"But suppose," says I, for argument sake, "that
you could see the great Collwar, or know where He was, and should pray
to Himself, without going about to His image first, do you think He
could not hear you?"--"I cannot tell that," says she.--"But how then,"
says I, "can He tell what (if it could speak) His image says, which is
as far from Him and then her own zealous application, with God's grace,
soon brought her to a firm belief in it, and a suitable temper and
conduct with respect to God and man."

After I had begun with my children, I frequently referred their further
instruction to their mother; for I have always experienced that a
superficial knowledge, with a desire of becoming a teacher, is in some
measure equivalent to better knowledge; for it not only excites every
principle one has to the utmost, but makes matters more clear and
conspicuous even to one's self.

By these means, and the Divine blessing thereon, in a few years, I may
fairly say, I had a little Christian church in my own house, and in a
flourishing way too, without a schismatic or heretic amongst us.


CHAPTER XXIV.

     The author's account of his children--Their names--They are
     exercised in flying--His boat crazy--Youwarkee intends a
     visit to her father', but first takes another flight to the
     ship--Sends a boat and chests through the gulf--Clothes her
     children--Is with child again, so her visit is put off--An
     inventory of the last freight of goods--The author's method
     of treating his children--Youwarkee, her son Tommy, with her
     daughters Patty and Hally-carnie, set out to her father's.

I had now lived here almost fourteen years, and besides the three sons
before mentioned, had three girls and one boy. Pedro, my eldest, had
the graundee, but too small to be useful; my second son Tommy had it
complete, so had my three daughters, but Jemmy and David, the youngest
sons, none at all. My eldest daughter I named Patty, because I always
called my first wife so. I say my first wife, though I had no other
knowledge of her death than my dream; but am from that as verily
persuaded, if ever I reach England, I shall find it so, as if I had
heard it from her aunt's own mouth. My second daughter my wife desired
might be called by her sister's name Hallycarnie, and my youngest I
named Sarah, after my mother. I put you to the trouble of writing down
the names, for as I shall hereafter have frequent occasion to mention
the children severally, it will be pleasanter for myself and you to call
them by their several names of distinction, than to call them my second
son, or my eldest daughter, and so forth.

My wife now took great delight in exercising Tommy and Patty (who were
big enough to be trusted) in flighty and would often skim round the
whole island with them before I could walk half through the wood. And
she would teach them also to swim or sail, I know not which to call it,
for sometimes you should see them dart out of the air as if they would
fall on their faces into the lake, when coming near the surface they
would stretch their legs in a horizontal posture, and in an instant turn
on their backs, and then you could see nothing from the bank, to all
appearance, but a boat sailing along, the graundee rising at their head,
feet, and sides, so like the sides and ends of a boat that you could not
discern the face or any part of the body. I own I often envied them this
exercise, which they seemed to perform with more ease than I could only
shake my leg or stir an arm.

Though we had perpetually swangeans about us, and the voices, as I used
to call them, I could never once prevail on my wife to show herself,
or to claim any acquaintance with her country folks. And what is very
remarkable in my children is, that my three daughters and Tommy, who had
the full graundee, had exactly their mother's sight, Jemmy and David had
just my sight, and Pedro's sight was between both, though he was never
much affected with any light; but I was obliged to make spectacles for
Tommy and all my daughters when they came to go abroad.

I had in this time twice enlarged my dwelling, which the increase of my
family had rendered necessary. The last alteration I was enabled to do
in a much better manner, and with more ease, than the first, for by
the return of my flota I had gotten a large collection of useful tools,
several of iron, where the handles or wood-work preponderated the iron;
but such as was all, or greatest part of that metal, had got either to
the rock, or were so fast fixed to the head of the ship, that it was
difficult to remove them, so that my wife could get comparatively few of
this latter sort, though some she did. It was well, truly, I had these
instruments, which greatly facilitated my labours, for I was forced to
work harder now than ever in making provision for us all; and my sons
Pedro and Tommy commonly assisted. I had also had another importation of
goods through the gulf, which still added to my convenience. But my boat
made me shudder every time I went into her; she had leaked again and
again, and I had patched her till I could scarce see a bit of the old
wood. She was of unspeakable use to me, and yet I could not venture
myself in her, but with the utmost apprehension and trembling. I had
been intending a good while, now I had such helps, to build a new one,
but had been diverted by one avocation or other.

About this time Youwarkee, who was now upwards of thirty-two years of
age, the fondest mother living, and very proud of her children, had
formed a project of taking a flight to Arndrumnstake, a town in the
kingdom of Doorpt Swangeanti, as I called it, where her father, if
living, was a colamb * under Georigetti, the prince of that country.
She imparted her desire to me, asking my leave; and she told me, if I
pleased, she would take Patty and Tommy along with her. I did not much
dislike the proposal, because of the great inclination I had for a
long time to a knowledge of, and familiarity with, her countrymen and
relations; and now I had so many of her children with me, I could not
think she would ever be prevailed on, but by force, to quit me and her
offspring, and be contented to lose six for the sake of having two with
her, especially as she had showed no more love for them than the rest,
so I made no hesitation, but told her she should go.

     * Governor.

I expected continually I should hear of her departure, but she saying no
more of it, I thought she had dropped her design, and I did not choose
to mention it. But one day, as we were at dinner, looking mighty
seriously, she said, "My dear, I have considered of the journey you have
consented I should take, but in order thereto it is necessary that I
prepare several things for the children, especially those who have no
graundee, and I am resolved to finish them before I go, that we may
appear with decency, both here and at Arndrumn-stake; for I am sure my
father, whose temper I am perfectly acquainted with, will, upon sight of
me and my little ones, be so overjoyed, that he will forgive my absence
and marriage, provided he sees reason to believe I have not matched
unworthily, unbecoming my birth; and after keeping me and the children
with him, it may be two or three months, will accompany me home again
himself with a great retinue of servants and relations; or, at least, if
he is either dead or unable for flight, my other relations will come or
send a convoy to take care of me and the children; and, my dear, as I
shall give them all the encomiums I can of you, and of my situation with
you, while I am among them, I would have them a little taken with the
elegance of our domestic condition when they come hither, that they
may think me happy in you and my children; for I would not only put my
family into a condition to appear before them, but to surprise the old
gentleman and his company, who never in their lives saw any part of
mankind with another covering than the graundee." When she had done, I
expressed my approbation of her whole system, as altogether prudent,
and she proceeded immediately to put it in execution. To work she went,
opened every chest, and examined their contents. But while she was upon
the hunt, and selecting such things as she thought fit for her purpose,
she recollected several articles she had observed in the ship, which
she judged far more for her turn than any she had at home. Hereupon she
prayed me to let her take another trip to the vessel, and to carry Tommy
with her.

After so many trials, and such happy experience of her wise and
fortunate conduct, I consented to her flight, and away went she and her
son. Upon their return, which was in a few days, she told me what they
had been doing, and said, as she so often heard me complain of the age
of my boat, and fear to sail in her, she had fitted me out a little
ship, and hoped it would in due time arrive safely. As she passed
quickly on to other things, I never once thought of asking her what
she meant by the little ship she spoke of; but must own that, like a
foolishly fond parent, I was more intent on her telling me how Tommy had
found a hoard of playthings, which he had packed up for his own use.

As to this last particular, I learned by the sequel of the story,
when the spark, proud of his acquisition, came to me, that he had been
peeping about in the cabin whilst his mother was packing the chests, and
seeing a small brass knob in the wainscot, took it for a plaything, and
pulling to get it out, opened a little door of a cupboard, where he
had found some very pretty toys that he positively claimed for himself,
among which were a small plain gold ring, and a very fine one set with
diamonds, which he showed me upon two of his fingers. I wondered how the
child, who had never before seen such things, or the use of them, should
happen to apply these so properly; but he told me in playing with
this, meaning the diamond ring, about his fingers, it slipped over his
middle-finger joint, and he could not get it off again, so he put the
other upon another finger to keep it company.

We watched daily, as usual on such occasions, for the arrival of our
fleet. It was surprising that none of the chests which Youwarkee shot
down the gulf were ever half so long in their passage as I was myself,
but some came in a week, some in a few days more, and even some in less,
which I attributed to their following directly the course of the water,
shooting from shelf to shelf as the tide sat; and I believe my keeping
the boat I sailed in so strictly and constantly in the middle of the
stream, was the reason of my being detained there so long. In less than
a fortnight everything came safe but one chest, which, as we never heard
of it, I suppose was either sunk or bulged.

Being one day upon shore, watching to see if anything more was come
through the cavern, I spied at a distance somewhat looking very black
and very long, and by the colour and shape thereof I took it for a young
whale. Having observed it some time making very little way, I took my
old boat and followed it, but was afraid to go near it, lest a stroke
with its tail--which I then fancied I saw move--might endanger my boat
and myself too; but creeping nearer and nearer, and seeing it did not
stir, I believed it to be dead; whereupon, taking courage, I drew so
close that at length I plainly perceived it was the ship's second boat
turned upside down. It is not easy to express the joy I felt on this
discovery. It was the very thing I was now, as I have said, in the
greatest want of. I presently laid hold of it and brought it ashore; and
it was no small pleasure to find, on examining, that though it had lain
so long dry, it was yet quite sound, and all its chinks filled up in
its passage; and it proved to me afterwards the most beneficial thing I
could have had from the ship.

I got all my goods home from the lake to my grotto, by means of the
cart, as usual. My wife and daughters waited with impatience for me
to unpack, that they might take possession of such things as would be
needful for rigging out the family against the supposed reception of
the old glumm, and had set all the chests in the order they desired they
might be opened in. But Tommy running to me, with a "Pray, daddy, open
my chest first! pray, give me my playthings first!" it was, to satisfy
him, concluded in favour of his demand. So, he pointing to the chest
which he regarded as his property, I opened it, whilst his eyes were
ready to pierce through it, till I came to his treasure. "There, there
they are, daddy!" says he, as soon as I had uncovered them. And indeed,
when I saw them, I could not but much commend the child for his fancy;
for the first things that appeared were a silver punch or wine can and
a ladle, then a gold watch, a pair of scissors, a small silver
chafing-dish and lamp, a large case of mathematical instruments, a
flageolet, a terrella or globular loadstone, a small globe, a dozen of
large silver spoons, and a small case of knives and forks and spoons;
in short, there was, I believe, the greatest part of the Portuguese
captain's valuable effects.

These Tommy claiming as his own proper chattels, I could not help
interposing somewhat of my authority in the affair. "Hold, hold, son!"
says I, "these things are all mine; but as I have several of you who
will all be equally pleased with them, though, as the first finder, you
may be entitled to the best share, you are not to grasp the whole, you
must all have something like an equality; and as to some things which
may be equally useful to us all, they must be set up to be used upon
occasion, and are to be considered as mine and your mother's property."
I thereupon gave each of them a large silver spoon, and with a fork I
scratched the initials of their names respectively on them, and divided
several of the trifles amongst them equally. "And now, Tommy," says I,
"you for your pains shall have this more than the rest," offering him
the flageolet. Tommy looked very gloomy, and though he durst not find
fault, his dissatisfaction was very visible by coolly taking it, tossing
it down, and walking gravely off. "I thought," says I, "Tommy, I had
made a good choice for you; but, as I find you despise it, here, Pedro,
do you take that pretty thing, since your brother slights it" Tommy
replied, speaking but half out, and a little surly, more than I ever
observed before, "Let him take it if he will, I can get bits of sticks
enough in the wood."

My method had always been to avoid either beating or scolding at my
children, for preferring their own opinion to mine; but I ever let
things turn about so, that from their own reason they should perceive
they had erred in opposing my sentiments, by which means they grew so
habituated to submit to my advice and direction, that for the most part
my will was no sooner known to them than it became their own choice; but
then I never willed according to fancy only, but with judgment, to the
best of my skill.

Tommy, therefore, as I said before, having shown a disapprobation of my
doings; to convince him of his mistake, I took the flageolet from Pedro.
"And now, Pedro," says I, "let me teach you how to manage this piece of
wood, as Tommy calls it, and then let me see if in all the grove he can
cut such another." On this I clapped it to my mouth, and immediately
played several country-dances and hornpipes on it; for though my mother
had scarce taught me to read, I had learnt music and dancing, being, as
she called them, gentlemanlike accomplishments. My wife and children,
especially Tommy, all stared as if they were wild, first on me, then on
one another, whilst I played a country-dance; but I had no sooner struck
up an hornpipe, than their feet, arms, and heads had so many twitching
and convulsive motions, that not one quiet limb was to be seen amongst
them; till having exercised their members as long as I saw fit, I almost
laid them all to sleep with Chevy Chase, and so gave over.

They no sooner found themselves free from this enchantment, than the
children all hustled round me in a cluster, all speaking together,
and reaching out their little hands to the instrument I gave it
Pedro. "There," says I to him, "take this slighted favour as no such
contemptible present."

Poor Tommy, who had all this while looked very simple, burst into a
flood of tears at my last words, as if his heart would have broke; and
running to me, fell on his knees, and begged my pardon, hoping I would
forgive him. I took him up, and kissing him, told him he had very little
offended me; for, as he knew, I had more children to give anything to
which either of the rest despised; it was equal to me who had it, so it
was thankfully received. I found that did not satisfy; still in tears,
he said, "Might he not have the stick again, as I gave it to him first?"
"Tommy," says I, "you know I gave it to you first; but you disapproving
my kindness, I have now given it Pedro, who, should I against his will
take it from him, would have that reason to complain which you have not,
who parted with it by your own consent; and therefore, Tommy, as I am
determined to acquaint you as near as I can with the strict rules of
justice, there must no more be said to me of this matter." Such as this
was my constant practice amongst them; and they having always found me
inflexible from this rule, we seldom had any long debates.

Though I say the affair ended so with regard to what I had to do in it,
yet it ended not so with Tommy; for though he knew he had no hopes of
moving me, he set all his engines at work to recover his stick, as he
called it, by his mother's and sisters' interest. These solicited Pedro
very strongly to gratify him. At length Pedro--he being a boy of a most
humane disposition--granted their desire, if I would give leave; and I
having signified, that the cause being now out of my hands, he might do
as he pleased, he generously yielded it. And indeed he could not have
bestowed it more properly; for Tommy had the best ear for music I ever
knew; and in less than a twelvemonth could far outdo me, his instructor,
in softness and easiness of finger; and was also master of every tune
I knew, which were neither inconsiderable in number, nor of the lowest
rate.

Youwarkee, with her daughters, sat close to work, and had but just
completed her whole design for the family clothing, when she told me
she found herself with child again. As that circumstance ill suited a
journey, she deferred her flight for about fifteen months; in which time
she was brought to bed, and weaned the infant, which was a boy, whom
I named Richard, after my good master at the academy. The little knave
thrived amain, and was left to my farther nursing during its mammy's
absence; who, still firm to her resolution, after she had equipped
herself and companions with whatever was necessary to their travelling,
and locked up all the apparel she had made till her return, because
she would have it appear new when her father came, set out with her son
Tommy and my two daughters Patty and Hallycarnie, the last of which by
this time being big enough also to be trusted with her mother.


CHAPTER XXV.

     Youwarkee's account of the stages to Arndrumstake--The
     author uneasy at her flight--His employment in her absence;
     and preparations for receiving her father--How he spent the
     evenings with the children.

My wife was now upon her journey to her father's; but where that was, or
how far off, it was impossible for me to conceive by her description
of the way; for she distinguished it not by miles or leagues, but by
swan-geans, and names of rocks, seas, and mountains, which I
could neither comprehend the distance of from each other, nor from
Graundevolet, where I was. I understood by her, indeed, there was a
great sea to be passed, which would take her up almost a day and night,
having the children with her, before she reached the next arkoe, though
she could do it herself she said, and strain hard, in a summer's
night; but if the children should flag by the way, as there was no
resting-place between us and Battringdrigg, the next arkoe, it might
be dangerous to them, so she would take the above time for their sakes.
After this, I found by what she said there was a narrow sea to pass, and
a prodigious mountain, before she reached her own country; and that her
father's was but a little beyond that mountain. This was all I could
know in general about it. At their departure she and the children had
taken each a small provision for their flight, which hung about their
necks in a sort of purse.

I cannot say, notwithstanding this journey was taken with my concurrence
and consent, that I was perfectly easy when they were gone, for my
affection for them all would work up imaginary fears too potent for my
reason to dispel, and which at first sat with no easy pressure upon
my mind. This my pretty babies at home perceiving, used all the little
winning arts they could to divert and keep up my spirits; and from day
to day, by taking them abroad with me, and playing with and amusing them
at home, I grew more and more persuaded that all would go right with the
absent, and that in due time I should see them return again.

But as the winter set in, I went little abroad, and then we employed
ourselves within doors in preparing several things which might not only
be useful and ornamental, if the old glumm should come to see us, but
might also divert us, and make the time pass less tediously. The first
thing I went upon was a table, which, as my family consisted of so many,
I intended to make big enough for us all. With that view I broke up a
couple of chests, and, taking the two sides of one of them, I nailed
them edge to edge by strong thick pieces underneath at each end and in
the middle; then I took two chest-lids with their hinges, nailing one
to each side of my middle piece, which made two good flaps; after this,
with my tools, of which I had now a chest-full, I chopped out of new
stuff and planed four strong legs quite square, and nailed them strongly
to each corner of my middle board; I then nailed pieces from one leg to
the other, and nailed the bed likewise to them; then I fastened a border
quite round within six inches from the bottom, from foot to foot, which
held all fast together. When all this was done, still my table was
imperfect; I could not put up the flaps, having no proper support. To
remedy this I sawed out a broad slip from a chest-side, and boring a
large hole through the centre, I spiked it up to the under-side of the
table's bed, with a spindle I contrived just loose enough to play round
the head of the spike, filing down that part of the spindle which passed
through the bed of the table, and riveting it close; so that when my
flaps were set up I pulled the slip crosswise of the table, and when the
flaps were down, the slip turned under the top of the table lengthwise:
next, under each flap, I nailed a small slip lengthwise of the flaps,
to raise them on a level, when up, with the top of the table. When I had
thus completed the several parts of this needful utensil, I spent some
time and pains by scraping and rubbing, to render it all as elegant as
could be, and the success so well answered my wish, that I was not a
little proud of the performance; and what rendered my work thereon a
still more agreeable task, was my pretty infants' company, who stood by,
expressing their wonder and approbation at every stroke.

Now I had gotten a table, I wanted chairs to it; for as yet we had
only sat round the room upon chests, which formed a bench of the whole
circumference, they stood so thick. There was no moving of them without
a monstrous trouble every time I might have occasion to set out my
table: besides, if I could have dragged them backwards and forwards,
they were too low to be commodious for seats; so I resolved to make some
chairs and stools also, that might be manageable. I will not trouble you
with the steps I took in the formation of these; only, in general, you
must know, that some more chests I broke up to that purpose served me
for timber, out of which I framed six sizeable handsome chairs, and a
competent number of stools.

But now that I was turned joiner, I had another convenience to provide
for. I had nothing wherein to enclose things, and preserve them from
dust, except the chests, and they were quite unfit for holding liquors,
victuals, and such like matters, but open shells, as most of my vessels
were. Wherefore, having several boards now remaining of the boxes I had
broken up for chairs and stools, I bethought me of supplying this great
deficiency; so of these spare boards, in a workmanlike way (for by this
time I was become a tolerable mechanic), I composed a very tight closet,
holding half-a-dozen broad shelves, shut up by a good pair of doors,
with a lock and key to fasten them. These jobs took me up almost three
months, and I thought I had not employed them idly, but for the credit
and service of my family. I was now again at leisure for farther
projects. I was uncertain as to my wife's return, how soon she might be
with me, or how much longer she might stay; but I was sure I could do
nothing in the meanwhile more grateful than increasing, by all means in
my power, the accommodations of my house, for the more polite as well as
convenient reception of her father, or any else who might accompany her
home in the way of a retinue, as she talked of. I saw plainly I had not
room for lodging them, and that was a circumstance of main importance to
be provided for. Hereupon I thought of adding a long apartment to one
of my outer-rooms, to range against the side of the rock; but reflecting
that such a thing would be quite useless, unless I could finish it in
time, so as to be complete when my guests came, and not knowing how soon
that might be, I resolved to quit this design; and I fell upon another
which might do as well, and required much less labour and fewer days to
perfect.

I remembered that amongst those things my wife had packed up on board
the ship, and which came home through the gulf, there were two of the
largest sails, and a couple of a smaller size. These I carried to
the wood, and tried them in several places to see where they might be
disposed to most advantage in the nature of a tent, and having found a
convenient spot to my purpose, I cut divers poles for supporters, and
making straining lines of my matweed, I pitched a noble one, sufficient
to cover or entertain a numerous company, and so tight everywhere as to
keep out the weather. The front of this new apartment I hung with blue
cloth, which had a very genteel effect. I had almost forgotten to tell
you that I contrived (by hanging one of the smaller sails across, just
in the middle, which I could let down or raise up at pleasure) to divide
the tent occasionally into two distinct rooms.

When I had proceeded thus far, there were still wanting seats for this
additional building, as I may call it, and though I could spare some
chests to sit on, I found they would not half do. For a supplement,
then, I took my axe and felled a couple of great trees, one from each
side of the tent, sawed off the tops, and cut each of the trunks in two
about the middle: these huge cylinders I rolled into the tent with a
good deal of toil and difficulty; two of them I thrust into the inner
division, and left two in the outer. I placed them as benches on both
sides, then, with infinite pains, I shaved the upper face of each smooth
and flat, and pared off all the little knots and roughnesses of the
front, so that they were fitted to sit on, and their own weight fixed
them in the place where I intended them to be. At the upper end of the
farther chamber I set three chests lengthwise for seats, or any other
use I might see fit to put them to.

During these operations we were all hard at it, and no hand idle but
Dicky in arms, and Sally, whom he kept in full employ; but Pedro, being
a sturdy lad, could drive a nail, and lift or carry the things I wanted,
and Jemmy and David, though so young, could pick up the chips, hold a
nail or the lamp, or be some way or other useful; for I always preached
to them the necessity of earning their bread before they ate it, and not
think to live on mine and their brother's labour.

The nights being pretty long, after work was over, and Sarah had fed her
brother and laid him in his hammock, we used to sit all down to enjoy
ourselves at a good meal, for we were never regular at that till night;
and then after supper, my wife being absent, one or other of the young
ones would begin with something they had before heard me speak of, by
saying, "Daddy, how did you use to do this or that in England?" Then all
ears were immediately open to catch my answer, which certainly brought
on something else done either there or elsewhere; and by their little
questions and my answers they would sometimes draw me into a story
of three hours long, till, perhaps, two or three of my audience were
falling asleep, and then we all went to bed.

I verily believe my children would, almost any of them, from the
frequent repetition of these stories, have given a sufficient account
of England to have gained a belief from almost any Englishman of their
being natives there.

I frequently observed, that when we had begun upon Cornwall, and
traversed the mines, the sea-coast, or talked of the fine gentlemen's
seats, and such things, one would start up, and, if the discourse
flagged ever so little, would cry, "Ay; but, daddy, what did you do when
the crocodile came after you out of the water?" And another, before
that subject was half-ended (and I was forced to enter on every one they
started), would be impatient for the story of the lion; and I always
took notice that the part each had made the most reflections on, was
always most acceptable to the same person: but poor Sally would never
let the conversation drop without some account of the muletto, it was
such a pretty, gentle creature, she said.


CHAPTER XXVI.

     The Author's concern at Youwarkees stay--Reflections on his
     condition--Hears a voice call him--Youwarhee's brother
     Quangrollart visits him with a companion--He treats them at
     the grotto--The brother discovers himself by accident--
     Wilkins produces his children to him

My head, as well as my hands, had now been employed for five months in
adjusting all things in the most suitable manner for the reception of
Youwarkee and her friends; but nobody coming, and light days getting
forward apace, I begin to grow very uneasy, and had formed divers
imaginations of what might occasion her stay. Thought I, I am afraid
all the pains I have been taking will be to no purpose; for either her
father will not let her return, or she has of herself come to such a
resolution; for she knows I cannot follow her, and had rather, perhaps,
live and enjoy the three children she has with her, amidst a number of
her friends and acquaintance, than spend the remainder of her days with
me and all our offspring in this solitude.

But then I reflected she chose it herself, or at least declared herself
perfectly satisfied, yea, delighted therewith. And here are her children
with me, the major part of them; yet, what can I think? since her return
is put off till the swangeans are over this arkoe, she will never bring
her relations now in this unseasonable time for flight; therefore I must
think, if she intended to return at all, it would have been before
now; and as the case is not so, my fear of losing her entirely prevails
greatly. Oh! says I, that we had but a post here as we have in England;
there we can communicate our thoughts at a distance to each other
without any trouble, and for little charge! What a country is this to
live in! and what an improper creature am I to live in it! Had I but
the graundee, I would have found her out by this time, be she where she
would; but, whilst every one about me can pass, repass, and act as they
please, I am fixed here like one of my trees, bound to the spot, or,
upon removal, to die in the attempt. Alas! why did I beget children
here, but to make them as wretched and inconsolable as myself! Some of
them are so formed, indeed, as to shift for themselves; but they owe it
to their mother, not to me. What! am I a father of children who will
be bound one day to curse me? Severe reflection! Yet I never thought of
this till now. But am I the only father in such a case? No, surely! for
am not I as much bound to curse my father as my children are to curse
me? He might have left me happy if he would; I would them if I could.
Again, are there not others who, by improper junction with persons
diseased in body or vicious in mind, have entailed greater misery
upon their posterity than I have on mine! My children are all healthy,
strong, and sound, both in body and mind; and is not that the greatest
blessing that can be bestowed on our beings? But they are imprisoned
in this arkoe! What then? With industry, here is no want; and as they
increase they may settle in communities, and be helpful to each other.
I have lived here well nigh sixteen years, and it was God's pleasure
I should be here; and can I think I was placed here with an injunction
contrary to the great command, "Increase and multiply?" If that were so,
can it be possible I should have received the only means of propagating,
as it were, from Heaven itself? No, it was certainly as much my Maker's
will that I should have posterity here, as that I myself should at first
be brought thither. This is a large and plentiful spot, and capable of
great improvement, when there shall be hands sufficient. How many petty
states are less than these my dominions! I have here a compass of near
twenty miles round, and how many thousands grow voluntarily grey in a
far less circuit?

I had hardly finished my reflections (for I was sitting by myself in my
tent upon one of the trees I had turned into benches), when I heard a
musical voice call, "Peter! Peter!" I started. "What's this?" says I.
"It is not Youwarkee's voice! What can this mean?" Listening, I heard it
again, but at so great a distance I could but just perceive the sound.
"Be it where it will," says I, "I will face it!" Thus speaking, I went
out of the tent, and hearkened very attentively, but could hear nothing.
I then ran for my gun, and walked through the wood as fast as I could
to the plain; but still I neither saw nor heard anything. I was then
in hopes of seeing somebody on the lake, but no one appeared; for I was
fully determined to make myself known to whomsoever I should meet; and,
if possible, to gain some intelligence of my wife. But after so much
fruitless pains, my hopes being at an end, I was returning when I heard,
"Peter! Peter!" again at a great distance, the sound coming from a
different quarter than at first. Upon this I stopped, and heard it
repeated; and it was as if the speaker approached nearer and nearer.
Hereupon I stepped out of the wood (for I had just re-entered it upon
my return home), when I saw two persons upon the swangean just over my
head. I cried out, "Who's that?" And they immediately called again,
"Peter! Peter!"--_Ors clam gee_, says I; that is, Here am I.--On this
they directly took a small sweep round (for they had overshot me before
they heard me) and alighted just by me; when I perceived them to be
my wife's countrymen, being dressed like her, with vol. only broader
chaplets about their heads, as she had told me the glumms all wore.
After a short obeisance, they asked me if I was the glumm Peter,
barkett* to Youwarkee. I answered I was. They then told me they
came with a message from Pendlehamby, colamb** of Arndrumn-stake, my
goppo,*** and from Youwarkee his daughter. I was vastly rejoiced to see
them, and to hear only the name of my wife. But though I longed to know
their message, I trembled to think of their mentioning it, as one
of them was just going to do, for fear of hearing something very
displeasing; so I begged them to go through the wood with me to the
grotto, where we should have more leisure and convenience for talk, and
where, at the same time, they might take some refreshment. But though I
had thus put off their message, I could not forbear inquiring by the way
after the health of my goppo, and my wife and children, how they got to
Arndrumnstake, and how they found their relations and friends. They told
me all were well; and that Youwarkee, as she did on me, desired I would
think on her with true affection. I found this was the phrase of the
country. As for the rest, I hoped it would turn out well at last, though
I dreaded to hear it.

     * Husband.

     ** Governor.

     *** Father-in-law.

Being arrived at the grotto, I desired my guests to sit down, and take
such refreshment as I could prepare them. When they were seated, I went
to work in order to provide them a repast. Seeing my fire piled up very
high, and burning fierce, and the children about it, they wondered where
they were got, and who they had come to, and turned their faces from it;
but I setting some chairs, so that the light might not strike on their
eyes, they liked the warmth well enough; though, I remarked, the light
did not affect them so much as it had done Youwarkee.

Whilst I was cooking, the poor children got all up in a corner, and
stared at the strangers, not being able to conceive where they came
from; and by degrees crept all backwards into the bedchamber, and hid
themselves; for they had never before seen anybody but my own family.

I observed that one of my guests paid more than ordinary respect to the
other; and though their graundees made no distinction between them,
yet there was something I thought much more noble in the address and
behaviour of the latter; and taking notice that he was also the chief
spokesman, I judged it proper to pay my respects to him in a somewhat
more distinguishing manner, though so as not to offend the other if I
should happen to be mistaken.

I first presented a can of my Madeira, and took care, as if by accident,
to give it to Mr. Uppermost, as I thought him, who drank half of it,
and would have given the remainder to his companion, but I begged him to
drink it all up, and his friend should be served with some presently: he
did so, and thanked me by lifting his hand to his chin. I then gave the
other a can of the same liquor, which he drank, and returned thanks as
his companion had before. I then took a can myself, and telling them
I begged leave to use the ceremony of my own country to them, I drank,
wishing their own health, and that of all relations at Arndrumnstake.
He that I took for the superior fell a-laughing heartily: "Ha, ha,
ha!" says he, "this is the very way my sister does every day at
Arndrumnstake."--"Your sister, sir!" says I, "pray has she ever been in
Europe or England?"--"Well!" says he, "I have plainly discovered myself,
which I did not intend to do yet; but, truly, brother Peter, I mean none
other than your own wife Youwarkee."

The moment I knew who he was, I rose up and taking him by the right
hand, lifted it to my lips and kissed it. He likewise immediately stood
up, and we embraced each other with great tenderness. I then begged him,
as I had so worthy and near a relation of my wife's with me, that he
would not delay the happiness I hoped for, in a narrative from his
mouth, how it fared with my father, wife, and children, and all their
kinsfolks and friends whom I had so often heard mentioned by my dearest
Youwarkee, and so earnestly desired to see.

My brother Quangrollart (for that, he told me, was his name)
was preparing to gratify my impatience; but seeing I had set the
entertainment on the table, which consisted chiefly of bread, several
sorts of pickles and preserves, with some cold salted fish, he said that
eating would but interrupt the thread of his discourse; and therefore,
with my leave, he would defer the relating of what I desired for a
little while; which we all thinking most proper, I desired him and
his friend (who might be another brother for aught I knew) to refresh
themselves with the poor modicum I was able to provide them.

Whilst my brother Quangrollart was looking upon and handling his plate,
being what he had never before seen, his friend had got the handle
of one of the knives in his mouth, biting it with all his force; but
finding he could make nothing of that end he tried the other, and got
champing the blade. Perceiving what he was at, though I could not help
laughing, I rose, and begging pardon, took the knife from him; telling
him I believed he was not acquainted with the use of that instrument,
which was one of my country implements; and that the design of it, which
was called a knife, and of that other (pointing to it), called a fork,
was the one to reduce the food into pieces proper for chewing, and the
other to convey it to the mouth without daubing the fingers, which must
happen in handling the food itself; and I then showed him what use I put
them to, by helping each of them therewith to somewhat, and by cutting a
piece for myself, and putting it to my mouth with the fork.

They both smiled and looked very well pleased; and then I told them
that the plate was the only thing that need be daubed, and when that was
taken away the table remained clean. So, after I had helped each of them
for the first time, I desired them to help themselves where they liked
best; and, to say the truth, they did so more dexterously than I could
have expected.

During our repast we had frequent sketches of the observations they made
in their flight, and of the places where they had rested; and I could
plainly see that neither of them had ever been at this arkoe before, by
hinting that if they had not taken such a course they had missed me.

I took particular notice which part of my entertainment they ate most
of, that I might bring a fresh supply of that when wanted; and I found
that though they eat heartily of my bread and preserves, and tasted
almost of everything else, they never once touched the fish; which put
me upon desiring I might help them to some. At this they looked upon
each other, which I readily knew the meaning of, and excused themselves,
expressing great satisfaction in what they had already gotten. I took,
however, a piece of fish on my own plate, and eating very heartily
thereof, my brother desired me to give him a bit of it; I did so, taking
care to cut it as free from bones as I could, and for greater security
cautioning him, in case there should be any, to pick them out, and not
swallow them. He had no sooner put a piece in his mouth, but, "Rosig,"
says he to his friend, "this is padsi."--I thought indeed I had puzzled
my brother when I gave him the fish, but by what he said of it, he
puzzled me; for I knew not what he meant by padsi, my wife having told
me they had no fish, or else I should have taken that word for their
name of it. However, I cut Rosig a slice; and he agreeing it was padsi,
they both ate heartily of it.

While we were at dinner, my brother told me he thought he saw some of my
children just now; for his sister had informed him she had five more at
home; and he asked me why they did not appear and eat with us. I excused
their coming, as fearing they would only be troublesome; and said, "When
we had done they should have some victuals." But he would not be put
off, and entreated me to admit them. So I called them by their names,
and they came, all but Dicky, who was asleep in his hammock. I told them
that Reglumm,* pointing to Quangrollart, was their uncle, their mamma's
brother, and ordered them to pay their obeisance to him, which they
severally did. I then made them salute Rosig. This last would have had
them sit down at table; but I positively forbade that; and giving each
of them a little of what we had before us, they carried it to the chests
and eat it there.

     * Gentleman.

When we had done, the children helped me to clear the table, and were
retiring out of the room; but then I recalled them and desired their
uncle to excuse their stay, for as he had promised me news of their
mammy and her family, it would be the height of pleasure to them to hear
him. He seemed very much pleased with this motion, desiring by all means
they might be present while he told his story. Whereupon I ordered them
to the chests again, while Quangrollart delivered his narrative.


CHAPTER XXVII.

     Quangrollart's account of Youwarkee's journey, and
     reception at her father's.

Having set on the table some brandy and Madeira, and each of us taken
one glass of both, I showed, by the attentiveness of my aspect and
posture, how desirous I was he should proceed to what he had promised.
Observing this, he went on in the following manner:--"Brother Peter,"
says he, "my sister Youwarkee, as I don't doubt you will be glad to hear
of her first, arrived very safe at Arndrumnstake the third day after
she left you, and after a very severe flight to the dear little
Hallycarnie,* who was a full day and a night on her graundee; and at
last would not have been able to have reached Battringdrigg but for my
sister's assistance, who, taking her sometimes on her back for a short
flight, by those little refreshments enabled her to perform it: but from
Battringdrigg, after some hours' rest, they came with pleasure to
the White Mountains, from whence, after a small stay, they arrived at
Arndrumnstake.

     * One of Wilkins' daughters.

"They alighted at our covett,* but were opposed at their entrance by the
guards, to whom they did not choose to discover themselves, till notice
was given to my father; who, upon hearing that some strangers desired
admittance to him, sent me to introduce them, if they were proper
persons for his presence, or else give orders for such other reception
as was suitable to them.

"When I came to the guard, I found three gawrys and a glumm boss,**
whose appearance and behaviour, I must own, prejudiced me very much in
their favour. I then asked from whence they came, and their business
with the colamb. You-warkee told me they came not about business of
public concern, relating to the colamb's office, but out of a dutiful
regard, as relations, to kiss his knees.--'My father' said I, 'shall
know it immediately; but first, pray inform me of your name?'--'Your
father!' replied Youwarkee; 'are you my brother Quangrollart?'--'My name
is so,' says I, 'but I have only one sister, now with my father, and
how I can be your brother, I am not able to guess.'--'Have you never had
another sister?' says she.--'Yes,' says I, 'but she is long since dead;
her name was Youwarkee.' At my mentioning her name, she fell upon
my neck in tears, crying, 'My dear brother, I am that dead sister
Youwarkee, and these with me are some of my children, for I have five
more; but, pray, how does my father and sister?'--I started back at this
declaration, to view her and the children, fearing it was some gross
imposition, not in the least knowing or remembering anything of her
face, after so long an absence; but I desired them to walk in, till I
told my father.

     * Capital Seat.

     ** Youth.

"The guard observing the several passages between us, were amazed to
think who it could be had so familiarly embraced me; especially as they
saw I only played a passive part in it.

"When I went in, I did not think proper directly to inform my father
what had happened; but calling my sister Hallycarnie, I let her into
the circumstances of this odd affair, and desired her advice what to do:
'For,' says I, 'surely this must be some impostor; and as my father has
scarce subdued his sorrow for my sister's loss, if this gawry should
prove a deceiver, it will only revive his affliction, and may prove at
this time extremely dangerous to him: therefore let us consider what had
best be done in the matter.'

"Hallycarnie, who had attentively weighed all I said, seemed to think
it was some cheat, as well as I did; for we could neither of us conceive
that anything but death, or being slit, could have kept Youwarkee so
long from the knowledge of her relations; and that neither of them could
be the case was plain, if the person attending was Youwarkee. 'Besides,
brother,' says Hallycarnie, 'she cannot surely be so much altered in
fifteen years, but you must have known her; and yet, now I think, it is
possible, you being so much younger, may have forgot her; but whilst we
have been talking of her, I have so well recollected her, that I think I
could hardly be imposed upon by any deceiver.' "I then desired her to
go with me to the strangers and see if she could make any discovery. She
did so, and had no sooner entered the abb,* but Youwarkee called
out, 'My dear sister Hally-carnie!' and she as readily recollecting
Youwarkee, they in transport embraced each other; and then your wife
presenting to us her three children, it proved the tenderest scene,
except the following, I ever saw.

     * Room.

"My father having kept his chamber some time with a fever, and though he
was pretty well recovered, having not yet been out of it, we consulted
how we might introduce our sister and children to him, with as little
surprise as might be, for fear of a relapse by too great a hurry of his
spirits. At length we concluded I should go tell him that some strangers
had arrived desiring to see him; but on inquiry, finding their business
was too trifling to trouble him upon, I had despatched them; I was then
to say how like one of them was to my sister Youwarkee; and whilst I was
speaking, Hallycarnie was to enter, and keep up the discourse till we
should find a proper opportunity of discovery. I went in, therefore, as
had been agreed; and upon mentioning the name of Youwarkee, my father
fetched a deep sigh and turned away from me in tears. At that instant
Hallycarnie came in as by accident. 'Sir,' says she, 'what makes you so
sad? are you worse to-day?'--'Oh,' says he, 'I have heard a name that
will never be out of my heart, till I am in hoximo.'*--'What, I suppose
my sister?'--''Tis true,' replied he, 'the same.'--Says she, 'I fancied
so, for I have just seen a stranger as like her as two dorrs** could be,
and would have sworn it was she, if that had been possible. I thought my
brother had been so imprudent as to mention her to you; and I think he
did not do well to rip up an old sore he knew was almost healed, and
make it break out afresh.'--'Ah! no, child,' says my father, 'that sore
never has, nor can be healed. O Great Image! why can't it by some means
or other be ascertained what end she came to?'

     * A place where the dead are buried.

     ** A fruit like an apple.

"'Sir,' says my sister, 'I think you are much to blame for these
exclamations, after so long absence; for, if she be dead, what use are
they of? and if she be not, all may be well, and you may still see her
again.'--'Oh, never, never!' says my father; 'but could I be sure she
was alive, I would take a swangean and never close my graundee till I
found her, or dropt dead in the search.'--'And suppose you could meet
with her, sir,' says I, 'the very sight would overcome you, and be
dangerous.' 'No, believe me, boy,' says he, 'I should then be fully easy
and composed; and were she to come in this moment, I should suffer no
surprise, but pleasure.'--'No surprise, sir?' says I.--'Not if she were
alive and well,' says he.--'Then, sir,' says Hallycarnie, 'will you
excuse me if I introduce her?' and went out directly without staying for
an answer.

"When she was gone, 'Quangrollart,' says my father sternly, 'what is the
meaning of yours and your sister's playing thus upon my weakness? It is
what I can upon no account forgive. It looks as if you were weary of
me, and wanted to break my heart. To what purpose is all this prelude of
yours, to introduce to me somebody, who, by her likeness to my daughter,
may expose me to your scoff and raillery? This is a disobedience I never
expected from either of you.'

"'The Great Image attend me!' says I; 'sir, you have much mistaken me;
but I will not leave you in doubt, even till Hallycarnie's return. You
shall see Youwarkee with her; for all our discourse, I'll assure you,
has but been concerted to prepare you for her reception, with three of
her children.' 'And am I then, says he, in a transport, 'still to be
blessed?'--'You are, sir,' says I, 'assure yourself you are.'

"By this time we heard them coming, but my poor father had not power to
go to meet them: and upon Youwarkee's nearer approach, to fall at his
knees, his limbs failing him, he sunk, and without speaking a word, fell
backwards on a cught drappec,* which stood behind him; and, being quite
motionless, we concluded him to be stone-dead. On this the women
became entirely helpless, screaming only, and wringing their hands in
extravagant postures. But I, having a little more presence of mind,
called for the calentar;** who, by holding his nose, pinching his feet,
and other applications, in a little time brought him to his senses
again.

     * A bed or couch covered with a sort of cotton.

     ** A sort of doctor in all great families.

"You may more easily conceive than I describe, both the confusion we
were all in during my father's disorder, and the congratulations upon
his recovery; so, as I can give you but a defective account of these,
I shall pass them by, and come to our more serious discourse, after my
father and your wife had, without speaking a word, wept themselves quite
dry on each other's necks.

"My father, then looking upon the three children (who were also crying
to see their mamma cry), 'And who are these?' says he.--'These, sir,'
says Youwarkee, 'are three of eight of your grandchildren.'--'And where
is your barkett?' says he. 'At home with the rest, sir,' replied she,
'who are some of them too small to come so far yet; but, sir,' says she,
'pray excuse my answering you any more questions, till you are a little
recovered from the commotion I perceive my presence has brought upon
your spirits; and as rest, the calentar says, will be exceedingly
proper, I will retire with my sister till you are better able to bear
company.' My father was with much difficulty prevailed with to part
with her out of his sight: but the calentar pressing it, we were all
dismissed, and he laid down to rest."

My brother would have gone on, but I told him, as it grew near time for
repose, and he and Rosig must needs be fatigued with so long a flight,
if they pleased (as I had already heard the most valuable part of all
he could say, in that my father had received my wife and children so
kindly, and that he left them all well) we could defer his farther
relation till the next day; which they both agreeing to, I laid them in
my own bed, myself sleeping in a spare hammock.
