"What? did you say that you were torpedoed the second time?" asked
Ralph.

"Yes," replied Mr. Elton. "We were picked up by a ship, the next
morning, which was bound for New York. Two days afterwards, when out of
the danger zone, our ship went down, and we had to take to the boats.
This time we were picked up by a ship that landed us in Havre, three
days ago. Then we heard of your exploits, of which the French papers
were full, and we determined to remain here until we heard from you."

"But I cannot understand how it was that the captain happened to reach
you by wireless?" asked Ralph.

"The cruiser wireless telegraphed the fact of our rescue to the U. S.
consul, and I wired the commander of the cruiser," replied Mr. Elton.

"I answered Mr. Elton's message," said the captain with a smile. "But
are you going back to America now?" continued the captain.

"Why, what has happened?" asked Alfred.

"America is at war with Germany," was the reply.

We shall now take leave of our young friends, but we do so with the
feeling that before long we shall hear more about them, and be able to
follow their adventures enlisted under the banner of their own beloved
land in the fight against oppression and savagery.
