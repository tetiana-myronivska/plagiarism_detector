        She ended here, and beckoned us:  the rest
   Parted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she
   Began to address us, and was moving on
   In gratulation, till as when a boat
   Tacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice
   Faltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried
   'My brother!'  'Well, my sister.'  'O,' she said,
   'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?
   Why who are these? a wolf within the fold!
   A pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!
   A plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'
   'No plot, no plot,' he answered.  'Wretched boy,
   How saw you not the inscription on the gate,
   LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'
   'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think
   The softer Adams of your Academe,
   O sister, Sirens though they be, were such
   As chanted on the blanching bones of men?'
   'But you will find it otherwise' she said.
   'You jest:  ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow
   Binds me to speak, and O that iron will,
   That axelike edge unturnable, our Head,
   The Princess.'  'Well then, Psyche, take my life,
   And nail me like a weasel on a grange
   For warning:  bury me beside the gate,
   And cut this epitaph above my bones;
   _Here lies a brother by a sister slain,
   All for the common good of womankind._'
   'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen
   And heard the Lady Psyche.'
                              I struck in:
   'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;
   Receive it; and in me behold the Prince
   Your countryman, affianced years ago
   To the Lady Ida:  here, for here she was,
   And thus (what other way was left) I came.'
   'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;
   If any, this; but none.  Whate'er I was
   Disrooted, what I am is grafted here.
   Affianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe
   Within this vestal limit, and how should I,
   Who am not mine, say, live:  the thunderbolt
   Hangs silent; but prepare:  I speak; it falls.'
   'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,
   I think no more of deadly lurks therein,
   Than in a clapper clapping in a garth,
   To scare the fowl from fruit:  if more there be,
   If more and acted on, what follows? war;
   Your own work marred:  for this your Academe,
   Whichever side be Victor, in the halloo
   Will topple to the trumpet down, and pass
   With all fair theories only made to gild
   A stormless summer.'  'Let the Princess judge
   Of that' she said:  'farewell, Sir--and to you.
   I shudder at the sequel, but I go.'

        'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,
   'The fifth in line from that old Florian,
   Yet hangs his portrait in my father's hall
   (The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow
   Sun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)
   As he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,
   And all else fled? we point to it, and we say,
   The loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,
   But branches current yet in kindred veins.'
   'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she
   With whom I sang about the morning hills,
   Flung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,
   And snared the squirrel of the glen? are you
   That Psyche, wont to bind my throbbing brow,
   To smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught
   Of fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read
   My sickness down to happy dreams? are you
   That brother-sister Psyche, both in one?
   You were that Psyche, but what are you now?'
   'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom
   I would be that for ever which I seem,
   Woman, if I might sit beside your feet,
   And glean your scattered sapience.
