Answ. 2. [The first answer is expounded by the second]. The law,
as it is a Covenant of Works, doth not allow of any repentance unto
life to those that live and die under it; for the law being once
broken by thee, never speaks good unto thee, neither doth God at
all regard thee, if thou be under that covenant, notwithstanding
all thy repenting and also promises to do so no more. No, saith
the law, thou hast sinned, therefore I must curse thee; for it is
My nature to curse, even, and nothing else but curse, every one
that doth in any point transgress against Me (Gal 3:10). They brake
My covenant "and I regarded them not, saith the Lord" (Heb 8:9).
Let them cry, I will not regard them; let them repent, I will not
regard them; they have broken My covenant, and done that in which
I delighted not; therefore, by that covenant I do curse, and not
bless; damn, and not save; frown, and not smile; reject, and not
embrace; charge sin and not forgive it. They brake My covenant
"and I regarded them not"; so that I say, if thou break the law,
the first covenant, and thou being found there, God looking on
thee through that, He hath no regard on thee, no pity for thee, no
delight in thee.

Object. Second. But hath not the law promises as well as threatenings?
saying, "The man which doeth these things shall live," mark, he
shall live, "by them," or in them (Rom 10:5; Gal 3:12).

Answ. 1. To break the Commandments is not to keep or fulfill the
same; but thou hast broken them, therefore the promise doth not
belong to thee by that covenant. 2. The promises that are of the
law are conditional, and so not performed unless there be a full
and continual obedience to every particular of it, and that without
the least sin. "Do this"--mark, do this--and afterwards thou shalt
live; but if thou break one point of it once in all thy life, thou
hast not done the law; therefore the promises following the law
do not belong unto thee if one sin hath been committed by thee. As
thus, I will give you a plain instance--"Set the case, there be a
law made by the king, that if any man speak a word against him he
must be put to death, and this must not be revoked, but must for
certain be executed on the offender; though there be a promise made
to them that do not speak a word against him, that they should have
great love from him; yet this promise is nothing to the offender;
he is like to have no share in it, or to be ever the better for it;
but contrariwise, the law that he hath offended must be executed
on him; for his sin shutteth him out from a share of, or in, the
promises." So it is here, there is a promise made indeed, but to
whom? Why, it is to none but those that live without sinning against
the law; but if thou, I say, sin one time against it in all thy
lifetime, thou art gone, and not one promise belongs to thee if
thou continue under this covenant. Methinks the prisoners at the
bar, having offended the law, and the charge of a just judge towards
them, do much hold forth the law, as it is a Covenant of Works,
and how it deals with them that are under it. The prisoner having
offended, cries out for mercy; Good, my lord, mercy, saith he,
pray, my lord, pity me. The judge saith, What canst thou say for
thyself that sentence of death should not be passed upon thee?
Why, nothing but this, I pray my lord be merciful. But he answers
again, Friend, the law must take place, the law must not be broken.
The prisoner saith, Good, my lord, spare me, and I will never do
so any more. The judge, notwithstanding the man's outcries and sad
condition, must, according to the tenor of the law, pass judgment
upon him, and the sentence of condemnation must be read to the
prisoner, though it makes him fall down dead to hear it, if he
executes the law as he ought to do. And just thus it is concerning
the Law of God.
