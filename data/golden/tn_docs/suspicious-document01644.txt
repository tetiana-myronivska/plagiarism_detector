013:049 So will it be at the Close of the Age.  The angels will go
        forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous,
013:050 and will throw them into the fiery furnace.  There will be
        the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth."
013:051 "Have you understood all this?"  He asked.  "Yes," they said.
013:052 "Therefore," He said, "remember that every Scribe well trained
        for the Kingdom of the Heavens is like a householder who brings
        out of his storehouse new things and old."
013:053 Jesus concluded this series of parables and then departed.
013:054 And He came into His own country and proceeded to teach in
        their synagogue, so that they were filled with astonishment
        and exclaimed, "Where did he obtain such wisdom,
        and these wondrous powers?
013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son?  Is not his mother called Mary?
        And are not his brothers, James, Joseph, Simon and Judah?
013:056 And his sisters--are they not all living here among us?
        Where then did he get all this?"
013:057 So they turned angrily away from Him.  But Jesus said to them,
        "There is no prophet left without honour except in his own
        country and among his own family."
013:058 And He performed but few mighty deeds there because of their
        want of faith.
014:001 About that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
014:002 and he said to his courtiers, "This is John the Baptist:
        he has come back to life--and that is why these miraculous
        Powers are working in him."
014:003 For Herod had arrested John, and had put him in chains,
        and imprisoned him, for the sake of Herodias his
        brother Philip's wife,
014:004 because John had persistently said to him, "It is not lawful
        for you to have her."
014:005 And he would have liked to put him to death, but was afraid
        of the people, because they regarded John as a Prophet.
014:006 But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced
        before all the company, and so pleased Herod
014:007 that with an oath he promised to give her whatever she asked.
014:008 So she, instigated by her mother, said, "Give me here on a dish
        the head of John the Baptist."
014:009 The king was deeply vexed, yet because of his repeated oath
        and of the guests at his table he ordered it to be given her,
014:010 and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
014:011 The head was brought on a dish and given to the young girl,
        and she took it to her mother.
014:012 Then John's disciples went and removed the body and buried it,
        and came and informed Jesus.
014:013 Upon receiving these tidings, Jesus went away by boat to an
        uninhabited and secluded district; but the people heard of it
        and followed Him in crowds from the towns by land.
014:014 So Jesus went out and saw an immense multitude, and felt compassion
        for them, and cured those of them who were out of health.
014:015 But when evening was come, the disciples came to Him and said,
        "This is an uninhabited place, and the best of the day is
        now gone; send the people away to go into the villages and buy
        something to eat."
014:016 "They need not go away," replied Jesus; "you yourselves must
        give them something to eat."
014:017 "We have nothing here," they said, "but five loaves and a
        couple of fish."
014:018 "Bring them here to me," He said,
014:019 and He told all the people to sit down on the grass.
        Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and after
        looking up to heaven and blessing them, He broke up the loaves
        and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed
        them to the people.
014:020 So all ate, and were fully satisfied.  The broken portions
        that remained over they gathered up, filling twelve baskets.
014:021 Those who had eaten were about 5,000 adult men, without reckoning
        women and children.
014:022 Immediately afterwards He made the disciples go on board
        the boat and cross to the opposite shore, leaving Him
        to dismiss the people.
014:023 When He had done this, He climbed the hill to pray in solitude.
        Night came on, and he was there alone.
014:024 Meanwhile the boat was far out on the Lake, buffeted and tossed
        by the waves, the wind being adverse.
014:025 But towards daybreak He went to them, walking over the waves.
014:026 When the disciples saw Him walking on the waves, they were
        greatly alarmed.  "It is a spirit," they exclaimed, and they
        cried out with terror.
014:027 But instantly Jesus spoke to them, and said, "There is no danger;
        it is I; do not be afraid."
014:028 "Master," answered Peter, "if it is you, bid me come to you
        upon the water."
014:029 "Come," said Jesus.  Then Peter climbed down from the boat
        and walked upon the water to go to Him.
014:030 But when he felt the wind he grew frightened, and beginning
        to sink he cried out, "Master, save me."
014:031 Instantly Jesus stretched out His hand and caught hold of him,
        saying to him, "O little faith, why did you doubt?"
014:032 So they climbed into the boat, and the wind lulled;
014:033 and the men on board fell down before him and said, "You are
        indeed God's Son."
014:034 When they had quite crossed over, they put ashore at Gennesaret;
014:035 and the men of the place, recognizing Him, sent word into all
        the country round.  So they brought all the sick to Him,
014:036 and they entreated Him that they might but touch the tassel
        of His outer garment; and all who did so were restored
        to perfect health.
015:001 Then there came to Jesus a party of Pharisees and Scribes
        from Jerusalem, who inquired,
015:002 "Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders
        by not washing their hands before meals?"
015:003 "Why do you, too," He retorted, "transgress God's commands
        for the sake of your tradition?
015:004 For God said, `Honour thy father and thy mother'; and `Let him
        who reviles father or mother be certainly put to death';
015:005 but you--this is what you say:  `If a man says to his father
        or mother, That is consecrated, whatever it is, which otherwise
        you should have received from me--
015:006 he shall be absolved from honouring his father'; and so you
        have abrogated God's Word for the sake of your tradition.
015:007 Hypocrites! well did Isaiah prophesy of you,
015:008 "`This is a People who honour Me with their lips, while their
        heart is far away from Me;
015:009 but it is in vain they worship Me, while they lay down precepts
        which are mere human rules.'"
015:010 Then, when He had called the people to Him, Jesus said,
        "Hear and understand.
015:011 It is not what goes into a man's mouth that defiles him;
        but it is what comes out of his mouth--that* defiles a man."
015:012 Then His disciples came and said to Him, "Do you know that the
        Pharisees were greatly shocked when they heard those words?"
015:013 "Every plant," He replied, "which my Heavenly Father has not
        planted will be rooted up.
015:014 Leave them alone.  They are blind guides of the blind;
        and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall
        into some pit."
015:015 "Explain to us this figurative language," said Peter.
015:016 "Are even you," He answered, "still without intellingence?
015:017 Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth passes
        into the stomach and is afterwards ejected from the body?
015:018 But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart,
        and it is these that defile the man.
015:019 For out of the heart proceed wicked thoughts, murder, adultery,
        fornication, theft, perjury, impiety of speech.
015:020 These are the things which defile the man; but eating with
        unwashed hands does not defile."
015:021 Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew into the vicinity of
        Tyre and Sidon.
015:022 Here a Canaanitish woman of the district came out and persistently
        cried out, "Sir, Son of David, pity me; my daughter is cruelly
        harassed by a demon."
015:023 But He answered her not a word.  Then the disciples interposed,
        and begged Him, saying, "Send her away because she keeps
        crying behind us."
015:024 "I have only been sent to the lost sheep of the house
        of Israel," He replied.
015:025 Then she came and threw herself at His feet and entreated Him.
        "O Sir, help me," she said.
015:026 "It is not right," He said, "to take the children's bread
        and throw it to the dogs."
015:027 "Be it so, Sir," she said, "for even the dogs eat the scraps
        which fall from their masters' tables."
015:028 "O woman," replied Jesus, "great is your faith:  be it done
        to you as you desire."  And from that moment her daughter
        was restored to health.
015:029 Again, moving thence, Jesus went along by the Lake of Galilee;
        and ascending the hill, He sat down there.
015:030 Soon great crowds came to Him, bringing with them
        those who were crippled in feet or hands, blind or dumb,
        and many besides, and they hastened to lay them at His feet.
        And He cured them,
015:031 so that the people were amazed to see the dumb speaking, the maimed
        with their hands perfect, the lame walking, and the blind seeing;
        and they gave the glory to the God of Israel.
015:032 But Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, "My heart
        yearns over this mass of people, for it is now the third day
        that they have been with me and they have nothing to eat.
        I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they should faint
        on the road."
015:033 "Where can we," asked the disciples, "get bread enough in this
        remote place to satisfy so vast a multitude?"
015:034 "How many loaves have you?"  Jesus asked.  "Seven," they said,
        "and a few small fish."
015:035 So He bade all the people sit down on the ground,
015:036 and He took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks
        He broke them up and then distributed them to the disciples,
        and they to the people.
015:037 And they all ate and were satisfied.  The broken portions
        that remained over they took up--seven full hampers.
015:038 Those who ate were 4,000 adult men, without reckoning
        women and children.
015:039 He then dismissed the people, went on board the boat,
        and came into the district of Magadan.
016:001 Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him; and, to make
        trial of Him, they asked Him to show them a sign in the sky.
016:002 He replied, "In the evening you say, `It will be fine weather,
        for the sky is red;'
016:003 and in the morning, `It will be rough weather to-day, for the sky
        is red and murky.'  You learn how to distinguish the aspect
        of the heavens, but the signs of the times you cannot.
016:004 A wicked and faithless generation are eager for a sign;
        but none shall be given to them except the sign of Jonah."
        and He left them and went away.
016:005 When the disciples arrived at the other side of the Lake,
        they found that they had forgotten to bring any bread;
016:006 and when Jesus said to them, "See to it:  beware of the yeast
        of the Pharisees and Sadducees,"
016:007 they reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we
        have not brought any bread."
016:008 Jesus perceived this and said, "Why are you reasoning
        among yourselves, you men of little faith, because you
        have no bread?
016:009 Do you not yet understand? nor even remember the 5,000 and
        the five loaves, and how many basketfuls you carried away,
016:010 nor the 4,000 and the seven loaves, and how many hampers
        you carried away?
016:011 How is it you do not understand that it was not about bread
        that I spoke to you?  But beware of the yeast of the
        Pharisees and Sadducees."
016:012 Then they perceived that He had not warned them against bread-yeast,
        but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
016:013 When He arrived in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus
        questioned His disciples.  "Who do people say that the Son
        of Man is?"  He asked.
016:014 "Some say John the Baptist," they replied; "others Elijah;
        others Jeremiah or one of the Prophets."
016:015 "But you, who do you say that I am?"  He asked again.
016:016 "You," replied Simon Peter, "are the Christ, the Son of
        the ever-living God."
016:017 "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-jonah," said Jesus; "for mere human
        nature has not revealed this to you, but my Father in Heaven.
016:018 And I declare to you that you are Peter, and that upon this
        Rock I will build my Church, and the might of Hades shall
        not triumph over it.
016:019 I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of the Heavens;
        and whatever you bind on earth shall remain bound in Heaven,
        and whatever you loose on earth shall remain loosed in Heaven."
016:020 Then He urged His disciples to tell no one that He was the Christ.
016:021 From this time Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He
        must go to Jerusalem, and suffer much cruelty from the Elders
        and the High Priests and the Scribes, and be put to death,
        and on the third day be raised to life again.
016:022 Then Peter took Him aside and began taking Him to task.
        "Master," he said, "God forbid; this will not be your lot."
016:023 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Adversary;
        you are a hindrance to me, because your thoughts are not
        God's thoughts, but men's."
016:024 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If any one desires
        to follow me, let him renounce self and take up his cross,
        and so be my follower.
016:025 For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whoever
        loses his life for my sake shall find it.
016:026 Why, what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole
        world but forfeits his life?  Or what shall a man give to buy
        back his life?
016:027 For the Son of Man is soon to come in the glory of the Father
        with His angels, and then will He requite every man according
        to his actions.
016:028 I solemnly tell you that some of those who are standing here
        will certainly not taste death till they have seen the Son
        of Man coming in His Kingdom."
017:001 Six day later, Jesus took with Him Peter and the brothers
        James and John, and brought them up a high mountain to
        a solitary place.
017:002 There in their presence His form underwent a change;
        His face shone like the sun, and His raiment became as white
        as the light.
017:003 And suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared to them conversing with Him.
017:004 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Master, we are thankful to you that we
        are here.  If you approve, I will put up three tents here,
        one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
017:005 He was still speaking when a luminous cloud spread over them;
        and a voice was heard from within the cloud, which said,
        "This is My Son dearly beloved, in whom is My delight.
        Listen to Him."
017:006 On hearing this voice, the disciples fell on their faces
        and were filled with terror.
017:007 But Jesus came and touched them, and said, "Rouse yourselves
        and have no fear."
017:008 So they looked up, and saw no one but Jesus.
017:009 As they were descending the mountain, Jesus laid a command upon them.
        "Tell no one," He said, "of the sight you have seen till
        the Son of Man has risen from among the dead."
017:010 "Why then," asked the disciples, "do the Scribes say that Elijah
        must first come?"
017:011 "Elijah was indeed to come," He replied, "and would
        reform everything.
017:012 But I tell you that he has already come, and they did
        not recognize him, but dealt with him as they chose.
        And before long the Son of Man will be treated by them
        in a similar way."
017:013 Then it dawned upon the disciples that it was John the Baptist
        about whom He had spoken to them.
017:014 When they had returned to the people, there came to Him a man
        who fell on his knees before Him and besought Him.
017:015 "Sir," he said, "have pity on my son, for he is an epileptic
        and is very ill.  Often he falls into the fire and often
        into the water.
017:016 I have brought him to your disciples, and they have not been
        able to cure him."
017:017 "O unbelieving and perverse generation!" replied Jesus;
        "how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you?
        Bring him to me."
017:018 Then Jesus reprimanded the demon, and it came out and left him;
        and the boy was cured from that moment.
017:019 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked Him, "Why could
        not we expel the demon?"
017:020 "Because your faith is so small," He replied; "for I solemnly
        declare to you that if you have faith like a mustard-seed,
        you shall say to this mountain, `Remove from this place to that,'
        and it will remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.
017:021 But an evil spirit of this kind is only driven out by
        prayer and fasting."
017:022 As they were travelling about in Galilee, Jesus said to them,
        "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;
017:023 they will put Him to death, but on the third day He will be
        raised to life again."  And they were exceedingly distressed.
017:024 After their arrival at Capernaum the collectors of the half-shekel
        came and asked Peter, "Does not your Teacher pay the half-shekel?"
017:025 "Yes," he replied, and then went into the house.  But before
        he spoke a word Jesus said, "What think you, Simon?  From whom
        do this world's kings receive customs or capitation tax?
        from their own children, or from others?"
017:026 "From others," he replied.  "Then the children go free," said Jesus.
017:027 "However, lest we cause them to sin, go and throw a hook
        into the Lake, and take the first fish that comes up.
        When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel in it:
        bring that coin and give it to them for yourself and me."
018:001 Just then the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who ranks
        higher than others in the Kingdom of the Heavens?"
018:002 So He called a young child to Him, and, bidding him stand
        in the midst of them,
018:003 said, "In solemn truth I tell you that unless you turn and
        become like little children, you will in no case be admitted
        into the Kingdom of the Heavens.
018:004 Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this young child,
        he it is who is superior to others in the Kingdom of the Heavens.
018:005 And whoever for my sake receives one young child such
        as this, receives me.
018:006 But whoever shall occasion the fall of one of these little
        ones who believe in me, it would be better for him to have
        a millstone hung round his neck and to be drowned in the depths
        of the sea.
018:007 "Alas for the world because of causes of falling!  They cannot
        but come, but alas for each man through whom they come!
018:008 If your hand or your foot is causing you to fall into sin,
        cut it off and away with it.  It is better for you to enter
        into Life crippled in hand or foot than to remain in possession
        of two sound hands or feet but be thrown into the fire
        of the Ages.
018:009 And if your eye is causing you to fall into sin, tear it out
        and away with it; it is better for you to enter into Life
        with only one eye, than to remain in possession of two eyes
        but be thrown into the Gehenna of fire.
018:010 "Beware of ever despising one of these little ones, for I
        tell you that in Heaven their angels have continual access
        to my Father who is in Heaven.
018:011 []
018:012 What do you yourselves think?  Suppose a man gets a hundred sheep
        and one of them strays away, will he not leave the ninety-nine
        on the hills and go and look for the one that is straying?
018:013 And if he succeeds in finding it, in solemn truth I tell you
        that he rejoices over it more than he does over the ninety-nine
        that have not gone astray.
018:014 Just so it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that one
        of these little ones should be lost.
018:015 "If your brother acts wrongly towards you, go and point
        out his fault to him when only you and he are there.
        If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
018:016 But if he will not listen to you, go again, and ask one or
        two to go with you, that every word spoken may be attested
        by two or three witnesses.
018:017 If he refuses to hear them, appeal to the Church; and if
        he refuses to hear even the Church, regard him just as you
        regard a Gentile or a tax-gatherer.
018:018 I solemnly tell you that whatever you as a Church bind on earth
        will in Heaven be held as bound, and whatever you loose
        on earth will in Heaven be held to be loosed.
018:019 I also solemnly tell you that if two of you here on earth agree
        together concerning anything whatever that they shall ask,
        the boon will come to them from my Father who is in Heaven.
018:020 For where there are two or three assembled in my name,
        there am I in the midst of them."
018:021 At this point Peter came to Him with the question, "Master,
        how often shall my brother act wrongly towards me and I
        forgive him? seven times?"
018:022 "I do not say seven times," answered Jesus, "but seventy
        times seven times.
018:023 "For this reason the Kingdom of the Heavens may be compared
        to a king who determined to have a settlement of accounts
        with his servants.
018:024 But as soon as he began the settlement, one was brought before
        him who owed 10,000 talents,
018:025 and was unable to pay.  So his master ordered that he and his
        wife and children and everything that he had should be sold,
        and payment be made.
018:026 The servant therefore falling down, prostrated himself at
