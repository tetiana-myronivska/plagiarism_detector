   THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.

   I chanced the other eve,--
     But how I ne'er will tell,--
   The paper to receive.
     That's published down in hell.

   In general one may guess,
     I little care to see
   This free-corps of the press
     Got up so easily;

   But suddenly my eyes
     A side-note chanced to meet,
   And fancy my surprise
     At reading in the sheet:--

   "For twenty weary springs"
     (The post from Erebus,
   Remark me, always brings
     Unpleasant news to us)--

   "Through want of water, we
     Have well-nigh lost our breath;
   In great perplexity
     Hell came and asked for Death;

   "'They can wade through the Styx,
     Catch crabs in Lethe's flood;
   Old Charon's in a fix,
     His boat lies in the mud,

   "'The dead leap over there,
     The young and old as well;
   The boatman gets no fare,
     And loudly curses hell.'

   "King Minos bade his spies
     In all directions go;
   The devils needs must rise,
     And bring him news below.

   "Hurrah! The secret's told
     They've caught the robber's nest;
   A merry feast let's hold!
     Come, hell, and join the rest!

   "An author's countless band,
     Stalked round Cocytus' brink,
   Each bearing in his hand
     A glass for holding ink.

   "And into casks they drew
     The water, strange to say,
   As boys suck sweet wine through
     An elder-reed in play.

   "Quick! o'er them cast the net,
     Ere they have time to flee!
   Warm welcome ye will get,
     So come to Sans-souci!

   "Smelt by the king ere long,
     He sharpened up his tooth,
   And thus addressed the throng
     (Full angrily, in truth):

   "'The robbers is't we see?
     What trade? What land, perchance?'--
   'German news-writers we!'--
     Enough to make us dance!

   "'A wish I long have known
     To bid ye stop and dine,
   Ere ye by Death were mown,
     That brother-in-law of mine.

   "'Yet now by Styx I swear,
     Whose flood ye would imbibe,
   That torments and despair
     Shall fill your vermin-tribe!

   "'The pitcher seeks the well,
     Till broken 'tis one day;
   They who for ink would smell,
     The penalty must pay.

   "'So seize them by their thumbs,
     And loosen straight my beast
   E'en now he licks his gums,
     Impatient for the feast.'--

   "How quivered every limb
     Beneath the bull-dog's jaws
   Their honors baited him,
     And he allowed no pause.

   "Convulsively they swear,
     Still writhe the rabble rout,
   Engaged with anxious care
     In pumping Lethe out."

   Ye Christians, good and meek,
     This vision bear in mind;
   If journalists ye seek,
     Attempt their thumbs to find.

   Defects they often hide,
     As folks whose hairs are gone
   We see with wigs supplied
     Probatum! I have done!


     BACCHUS IN THE PILLORY.

   Twirl him! twirl him! blind and dumb
      Deaf and dumb,
    Twirl the cane so troublesome!
   Sprigs of fashion by the dozen
   Thou dost bring to book, good cousin.
    Cousin, thou art not in clover;
   Many a head that's filled with smoke
   Thou hast twirled and well-nigh broke,
   Many a clever one perplexed,
   Many a stomach sorely vexed,
    Turning it completely over;
   Many a hat put on awry,
   Many a lamb chased cruelly,
   Made streets, houses, edges, trees,
   Dance around us fools with ease.
    Therefore thou are not in clover,
   Therefore thou, like other folk,
   Hast thy head filled full of smoke,
   Therefore thou, too, art perplexed,
   And thy stomach's sorely vexed,
    For 'tis turned completely over;
    Therefore thou art not in clover.

   Twirl him! twirl him! blind and dumb
      Deaf and dumb,
    Twirl the carle so troublesome!
   Seest thou how our tongues and wits
   Thou hast shivered into bits--
    Seest thou this, licentious wight?
   How we're fastened to a string,
   Whirled around in giddy ring,
   Making all like night appear,
   Filling with strange sounds our ear?
    Learn it in the stocks aright!
   When our ears wild noises shook,
   On the sky we cast no look,
   Neither stock nor stone reviewed,
   But were punished as we stood.
    Seest thou now, licentious wight?
   That, to us, yon flaring sun
   Is the Heidelbergers' tun;
   Castles, mountains, trees, and towers,
   Seem like chopin-cups of ours.
    Learn'st thou now, licentious wight?
    Learn it in the stocks aright!

   Twirl him! twirl him! blind and dumb,
      Deaf and dumb,
    Twirl the carle so troublesome!
   Kinsman, once so full of glee,
   Kinsman, where's thy drollery,
    Where thy tricks, thou cunning one?
   All thy tricks are spent and past,
   To the devil gone at last
   Like a silly fop thou'lt prate,
   Like a washerwoman rate.
    Thou art but a simpleton.
   Now thou mayest--more shame to thee--
   Run away, because of me;
   Cupid, that young rogue, may glory
   Learning wisdom from thy story;
    Haste, thou sluggard, hence to flee
   As from glass is cut our wit,
   So, like lightning, 'twill be split;
   If thou won't be chased away,
   Let each folly also stay
    Seest my meaning? Think of me!
    Idle one, away with thee!


         SPINOSA.

    A mighty oak here ruined lies,
    Its top was wont to kiss the skies,
     Why is it now o'erthrown?--
   The peasants needed, so they said,
   Its wood wherewith to build a shed,
     And so they've cut it down.


         TO THE FATES.

   Not in the crowd of masqueraders gay,
    Where coxcombs' wit with wondrous splendor flares,
   And, easier than the Indian's net the prey,
    The virtue of young beauties snares;--

   Not at the toilet-table of the fair,
    Where vanity, as if before an idol, bows,
   And often breathes a warmer prayer
    Than when to heaven it pays its vows;

   And not behind the curtain's cunning veil,
    Where the world's eye is hid by cheating night,
   And glowing flames the hearts assail,
    That seemed but chilly in the light,--

   Where wisdom we surprise with shame-dyed lip,
    While Phoebus' rays she boldly drinks,
   Where men, like thievish children, nectar sip,
    And from the spheres e'en Plato sinks--

   To ye--to ye, O lonely sister-band,
    Daughters of destiny, ascend,
   When o'er the lyre all-gently sweeps my hand,
    These strains, where bliss and sadness blend.

   You only has no sonnet ever wooed,
    To win your gold no usurer e'er sighed
   No coxcomb e'er with plaints your steps pursued,
    For you, Arcadian shepherd ne'er has died.

   Your gentle fingers ye forever ply,
    Life's nervous thread with care to twist,
   Till sound the clanging shears, and fruitlessly
    The tender web would then resist.

   Since thou my thread of life hast kindly spun,
    Thy hand, O Clotho, I now kiss!
   Since thou hast spared that life whilst scarce begun,
    Receive this nosegay, Lachesis!

   Full often thorns upon the thread,
    But oftener roses, thou hast strung;
   For thorns and roses there outspread,
    Clotho, to thee this lay be sung!

   Oft did tempestuous passions rise,
    And threat to break the thread by force;
   Oft projects of gigantic size
    Have checked its free, unfettered course.

   Oft, in sweet hours of heavenly bliss,
    Too fine appeared the thread to me;
   Still oftener, when near sorrow's dark abyss,
    Too firm its fabric seemed to be.

   Clotho, for this and other lies,
    Thy pardon I with tears implore;
   Henceforth I'll take whatever prize
    Sage Clotho gives, and asks no more.

   But never let the shears cut off a rose--
    Only the thorns,--yet as thou will'st!
   Let, if thou will'st, the death-shears, sharply close,
    If thou this single prayer fulfill'st!

   Oh, goddess! when, enchained to Laura's breath,
    My spirit from its shell breaks free,
   Betraying when, upon the gates of death,
    My youthful life hangs giddily,

   Let to infinity the thread extend,
    'Twill wander through the realms of bliss,--
   Then, goddess, let thy cruel shears descend!
    Then let them fall, O Lachesis!


         THE PARALLEL.

   Her likeness Madame Ramler bids me find;
    I try to think in vain, to whom or how
   Beneath the moon there's nothing of the kind.--
    I'll show she's like the moon, I vow!

   The moon--she rouges, steals the sun's bright light,
    By eating stolen bread her living gets,--
   Is also wont to paint her cheeks at night,
    While, with untiring ardor, she coquets.

   The moon--for this may Herod give her thanks!--
    Reserves her best till night may have returned;
   Our lady swallows up by day the francs
    That she at night-time may have earned.

   The moon first swells, and then is once more lean,
    As surely as the month comes round;
   With Madame Ramler 'tis the same, I ween--
    But she to need more time is found!

   The moon to love her silver-horns is said,
    But makes a sorry show;
   She likes them on her husband's head,--
    She's right to have it so


        KLOPSTOCK AND WIELAND.

   (WHEN THEIR MINIATURES WERE HANGING SIDE BY SIDE.)

   In truth, when I have crossed dark Lethe's river,
   The man upon the right I'll love forever,
     For 'twas he first that wrote for me.
   For all the world the left man wrote, full clearly,
   And so we all should love him dearly;
     Come, left man! I must needs kiss thee!


     THE MUSES' REVENGE.

     AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.

   Once the nine all weeping came
    To the god of song
   "Oh, papa!" they there exclaim--
    "Hear our tale of wrong!

   "Young ink-lickers swarm about
    Our dear Helicon;
   There they fight, manoeuvre, shout,
    Even to thy throne.

   "On their steeds they galop hard
    To the spring to drink,
   Each one calls himself a bard--
    Minstrels--only think!

   "There they--how the thing to name!
    Would our persons treat--
   This, without a blush of shame,
    We can ne'er repeat;

   "One, in front of all, then cries,
    'I the army lead!'
   Both his fists he wildly plies,
    Like a bear indeed!

   "Others wakes he in a trice
    With his whistlings rude;
   But none follow, though he twice
    Has those sounds renewed.

   "He'll return, he threats, ere long,
    And he'll come no doubt!
   Father, friend to lyric song,
    Please to show him out!"

   Father Phoebus laughing hears
    The complaint they've brought;
   "Don't be frightened, pray, my dears,
    We'll soon cut them short!

   "One must hasten to hell-fire,
    Go, Melpomene!
   Let a fury borrow lyre,
    Notes, and dress, of thee.

   "Let her meet, in this array,
    One of these vile crews,
   As though she had lost her way,
    Soon as night ensues.

   "Then with kisses dark, I trust,
    They'll the dear child greet,
   Satisfying their wild lust
    Just as it is meet!"--

   Said and done!--Then one from hell
    Soon was dressed aright.
   Scarcely had the prey, they tell,
    Caught the fellow's sight,

   Than, as kites a pigeon follow,
    They attacked her straight--
   Part, not all, though, I can swallow
    Of what folks relate.

   If fair boys were 'mongst the band,
    How came they to be--
   This I cannot understand,--
    In such company?
     .   .   .   .   .
   The goddess a miscarriage had, good lack!
   And was delivered of an--Almanac!


     THE HYPOCHONDRIACAL PLUTO.

         A ROMANCE.

         BOOK I.

   The sullen mayor who reigns in hell,
    By mortals Pluto hight,
   Who thrashes all his subjects well,
   Both morn and eve, as stories tell,
    And rules the realms of night,
   All pleasure lost in cursing once,
   All joy in flogging, for the nonce.

   The sedentary life he led
    Upon his brazen chair
   Made his hindquarters very red,
   While pricks, as from a nettle-bed,
    He felt both here and there:
   A burning sun, too, chanced to shine,
   And boiled down all his blood to brine.

   'Tis true he drank full many a draught
    Of Phlegethon's black flood;
   By cupping, leeches, doctor's craft,
   And venesection, fore and aft,
    They took from him much blood.
   Full many a clyster was applied,
   And purging, too, was also tried.

   His doctor, versed in sciences,
    With wig beneath his hat,
   Argued and showed with wondrous ease,
   From Celsus and Hippocrates,
    When he in judgment sat,--
   "Right worshipful the mayor of hell,
   The liver's wrong, I see full well."

   "He's but a booby," Pluto said,
    "With all his trash and pills!
   A man like me--pray where's his head?
   A young man yet--his wits have fled!
    While youth my veins yet fills!
   Unless electuaries he'll bring,
   Full in his face my club I'll fling!"

   Or right or wrong,--'twas a hard case
    To weather such a trial;
   (Poor men, who lose a king's good grace!)
   He's straight saluted in the face
    By every splint and phial.
   He very wisely made no fuss;
   This hint he learnt of Cerberus.

   "Go! fetch the barber of the skies,
    Apollo, to me soon!"
   An airy courier straightway flies
   Upon his beast, and onward hies,
    And skims past poles and moon;
   As he went off, the clock struck four,
   At five his charger reached the door.

   Just then Apollo happened--"Heigh-ho!
    A sonnet to have made?"
   Oh, dear me, no!--upon Miss Io
   (Such is the tale I heard from Clio)
    The midwife to have played.
   The boy, as if stamped out of wax,
   Might Zeus as father fairly tax.

   He read the letter half asleep,
    Then started in dismay:
   "The road is long, and hell is deep,
   Your rocks I know are rough and steep . . .
    Yet like a king he'll pay!"
   He dons his cap of mist and furs,
   Then through the air the charger spurs.

   With locks all frizzled a la mode,
    And ruffles smooth and nice,
   In gala dress, that brightly glowed
   (A gift Aurora had bestowed),
    With watch-chains of high price,
   With toes turned out, and chapeau bas,
   He stood before hell's mighty czar.

         BOOK II.

   The grumbler, in his usual tone,
    Received him with a curse:
   "To Pomerania straight begone!
   Ugh! how he smells of eau de Cologne!
    Why, brimstone isn't worse.
   He'd best be off to heaven again,
   Or he'll infect hell's wide domain."

   The god of pills, in sore surprise,
    A spring then backwards took:
   "Is this his highness' usual guise?
   'Tis in the brain, I see, that lies
    The mischief--what a look!
   See how his eyes in frenzy roll!
   The case is bad, upon my soul!

   "A journey to Elysium
    The infectus would dissolve,
   Making the saps less tough become,
   As through the Capitolium
    And stomach they revolve.
   Provisionally be it so:
   Let's start then--but incognito!"

   "Ay, worthy sir, no doubt well meant!
    If, in these regions hazy,
   As with you folk, so charged with scent,
   You dapper ones who heaven frequent,
    'Twere proper to be lazy,
   If hell a master needed not,
   Why, then I'd follow on the spot!

   "Ha! if the cat once turned her back,
    Pray where would be the mice?
   They'd sally forth from every crack,
   My very mufti would attack,
    Spoil all things in a trice!
   Oddsbodikins! 'tis pretty cool!
   I'll let him see I'm no such fool!

   "A pleasant uproar happened erst,
    When they assailed my tower!
   No fault of mine 'twas, at the worst,
   That from their desks and chains to burst
    Philosophers had power.
   What, has there e'er escaped a poet?
   Help, heaven! what misery to know it!

   "When days are long, folks talk more stuff!
    Upon your seats, no doubt,
   With all your cards and music rough,
   And scribblings too, 'tis hard enough
    The moments to eke out.
   Idleness, like a flea will gnaw
   On velvet cushions,--as on straw.

   "My brother no attempt omits
    To drive away ennui;
   His lightning round about him flits,
   The target with his storms he hits
    (Those howls prove that to me),
   Till Rhea's trembling shoulders ache,
   And force me e'en for hell to quake.

   "Were I grandfather Coelus, though,
    You wouldn't soon escape!
   Into my belly straight you'd go,
   And in your swaddling-clothes cry 'oh!'
    And through five windows gape!
   First o'er my stream you'd have to come,
   And then, perhaps, to Elysium!

   "Your steed you mounted, I dare say,
    In hopes to catch a goose;
   If it is worth the trouble, pray
   Tell what you've heard from me to-day,
    At shaving time, to Zeus.
   Just leave him then to swallow it;
   I don't care what he thinks a bit;

   "You'd better now go homeward straight!
    Your servant! there's the door!
   For all your pains--one moment wait!
   I'll give you--liberal is the rate--
    A piece of ruby-ore.
   In heaven such things are rareties;
   We use them for base purposes."

        BOOK III.

   The god at once, then, said farewell,
    At small politeness striving;
   When sudden through the crowds of hell
   A flying courier rushed pell-mell,
    From Tellus' bounds arriving.
   "Monarch! a doctor follows me!
   Behold this wondrous prodigy!"

   "Place for the doctor!" each one said--
    He comes with spurs and whip,
   To every one he nods his head,
   As if he had been born and bred
    In Tartarus--the rip!
   As jaunty, fearless, full of nous
   As Britons in the Lower House.

   "Good morrow, worthy sirs!--Ahem!
    I'm glad to see that here
   (Where all they of Prometheus' stem
   Must come, whene'er the Fates condemn)
    One meets with such good cheer!
   Why for Elysium care a rush?
   I'd rather see hell's fountains gush!"

   "Stop! stop! his impudence, I vow,
    Its due reward shall meet;
   By Charles's wain, I swear it now!
   He must--no questions I'll allow,--
    Prescribe me a receipt.
   All hell is mine, I'm Pluto hight!
   Make haste to bring your wares to light!"

   The doctor, with a knowing look,
    The swarthy king surveyed;
   He neither felt his pulse, nor took
   The usual steps,--(see Galen's book),--
    No difference 'twould have made
   As piercing as electric fire
   He eyed him to his heart's desire.

   "Monarch! I'll tell thee in a trice
    The thing that's needed here;
   Though desperate may seem the advice--
   The case itself is very nice--
    And children dragons fear.
   Devil must devil eat!--no more!--
   Either a wife,--or hellebore!

   "Whether she scold, or sportive play,
    ('Tween these, no medium's known),
   She'll drive the incubus away
   That has assailed thee many a day
    Upon thine iron throne.
   She'll make the nimble spirits fleet
   Up towards the head, down towards the feet."

   Long may the doctor honored be
    Who let this saying fall!
   He ought to have his effigy
   By Phidias sculptured, so that he
    May be discerned by all;
   A monument forever thriving,
   Boerhaave, Hippocrates, surviving!


        REPROACH--TO LAURA.

   Maiden, stay!--oh, whither wouldst thou go?
   Do I still or pride or grandeur show?
     Maiden, was it right?
   Thou the giant mad'st a dwarf once more,
   Scattered'st far the mountains that of yore
     Climbed to glory's sunny height.

   Thou hast doomed my flowerets to decay,
   All the phantoms bright hast blown away,
     Whose sweet follies formed the hero's trust;
   All my plans that proudly raised their head
   Thou dost, with gentle zephyr-tread,
     Prostrate, laughing, in the dust.

   To the godhead, eagle-like, I flew,--
   Smiling, fortune's juggling wheel to view,
     Careless wheresoe'er her ball might fly;
   Hovering far beyond Cocytus' wave,
   Death and life receiving like a slave--
     Life and death from out one beaming eye!

   Like the victors, who, with thunder-lance,
   On the iron plain of glory dance,
     Starting from their mistress' breast,--
   From Aurora's rosy bed upsprings
   God's bright sun, to roam o'er towns of kings,
     And to make the young world blest!

   Toward the hero doth this heart still strain?
   Drink I, eagle, still the fiery rain
     Of thine eye, that burneth to destroy?
   In the glances that destructive gleam,
   Laura's love I see with sweetness beam,--
     Weep to see it--like a boy!

   My repose, like yonder image bright,
   Dancing in the waters--cloudless, light,
     Maiden, hath been slain by thee!
   On the dizzy height now totter I--
   Laura--if from me--my Laura fly!
     Oh, the thought to madness hurries me!

   Gladly shout the revellers as they quaff,
   Raptures in the leaf-crowned goblet laugh,
     Jests within the golden wine have birth,
   Since the maiden hath enslaved my mind,
   I have left each youthful sport behind,
     Friendless roam I o'er the earth.

   Hear I still bright glory's thunder-tone?
   Doth the laurel still allure me on?
     Doth thy lyre, Apollo Cynthius?
   In my breast no echoes now arise,
   Every shamefaced muse in sorrow flies,--
     And thou, too, Apollo Cynthius?

   Shall I still be, as a woman, tame?
   Do my pulses, at my country's name,
     Proudly burst their prison-thralls?
   Would I boast the eagle's soaring wing?
   Do I long with Roman blood to spring,
     When my Hermann calls?

   Oh, how sweet the eye's wild gaze divine
   Sweet to quaff the incense at that shrine!
     Prouder, bolder, swells the breast.
   That which once set every sense on fire,
   That which once could every nerve inspire,
     Scarce a half-smile now hath power to wrest!

   That Orion might receive my fame,
   On the time-flood's heaving waves my name
     Rocked in glory in the mighty tide;
   So that Kronos' dreaded scythe was shivered,
   When against my monument is quivered,
     Towering toward the firmament in pride.

   Smil'st thou?--No? to me naught's perished now!
   Star and laurel I'll to fools allow,
     To the dead their marble cell;--
   Love hath granted all as my reward,
   High o'er man 'twere easy to have soared,
     So I love him well!


        THE SIMPLE PEASANT. [62]

   MATTHEW.
   Gossip, you'll like to hear, no doubt!
   A learned work has just come out--
   Messias is the name 'twill bear;
   The man has travelled through the air,
   And on the sun-beplastered roads
   Has lost shoe-leather by whole loads,--
   Has seen the heavens lie open wide,
   And hell has traversed with whole hide.
   The thought has just occurred to me
   That one so skilled as he must be
   May tell us how our flax and wheat arise.
    What say you?--Shall I try to ascertain?

   LUKE.
   You fool, to think that any one so wise
    About mere flax and corn would rack his brain.


          ACTAEON.

   Thy wife is destined to deceive thee!
   She'll seek another's arms and leave thee,
    And horns upon thy head will shortly sprout!
   How dreadful that when bathing thou shouldst see me
    (No ether-bath can wash the stigma out),
   And then, in perfect innocence, shouldst flee me!


     MAN'S DIGNITY.

   I am a man!--Let every one
    Who is a man, too, spring
   With joy beneath God's shining sun,
    And leap on high, and sing!

   To God's own image fair on earth
    Its stamp I've power to show;
   Down to the front, where heaven has birth
    With boldness I dare go.

   'Tis well that I both dare and can!
    When I a maiden see,
   A voice exclaims: thou art a man!
    I kiss her tenderly.

   And redder then the maiden grows,
    Her bodice seems too tight--
   That I'm a man the maiden knows,
    Her bodice therefore's tight.

   Will she, perchance, for pity cry,
    If unawares she's caught?
   She finds that I'm a man--then, why
    By her is pity sought?

   I am a man; and if alone
    She sees me drawing near,
   I make the emperor's daughter run,
    Though ragged I appear.

   This golden watchword wins the smile
    Of many a princess fair;
   They call--ye'd best look out the while,
    Ye gold-laced fellows there!

   That I'm a man is fully shown
    Whene'er my lyre I sweep;
   It thunders out a glorious tone--
    It otherwise would creep.

   The spirit that my veins now hold,
    My manhood calls its brother!
   And both command, like lions bold,
    And fondly greet each other.

   From out this same creative flood
    From which we men have birth,
   Both godlike strength and genius bud,
    And everything of worth.

   My talisman all tyrants hates,
    And strikes them to the ground;
   Or guides us gladly through life's gates
    To where the dead are found.

   E'en Pompey, at Pharsalia's fight,
    My talisman o'erthrew;
   On German sand it hurled with might
    Rome's sensual children, too.

   Didst see the Roman, proud and stern,
    Sitting on Afric's shore?
   His eyes like Hecla seem to burn,
    And fiery flames outpour.

   Then comes a frank and merry knave,
    And spreads it through the land:
   "Tell them that thou on Carthage's grave
    Hast seen great Marius stand!"

   Thus speaks the son of Rome with pride,
    Still mighty in his fall;
   He is a man, and naught beside,--
    Before him tremble all.

   His grandsons afterwards began
    Their portions to o'erthrow,
   And thought it well that every man
    Should learn with grace to crow.

   For shame, for shame,--once more for shame!
    The wretched ones?--they've even
   Squandered the tokens of their fame,
    The choicest gifts of heaven.

   God's counterfeit has sinfully
    Disgraced his form divine,
   And in his vile humanity
    Has wallowed like the swine.

   The face of earth each vainly treads,
    Like gourds, that boys in sport
   Have hollowed out to human heads,
    With skulls, whose brains are--naught.

   Like wine that by a chemist's art
    Is through retorts refined,
   Their spirits to the deuce depart,
    The phlegma's left behind.

   From every woman's face they fly,
    Its very aspect dread,--
   And if they dared--and could not--why,
    'Twere better they were dead.

   They shun all worthies when they can,
    Grief at their joy they prove--
   The man who cannot make a man,
    A man can never love!

   The world I proudly wander o'er,
    And plume myself and sing
   I am a man!--Whoe'er is more?
    Then leap on high, and spring!


        THE MESSIAD.

   Religion 'twas produced this poem's fire;
   Perverted also?--prithee, don't inquire!


     THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.

   What mean the joyous sounds from yonder vine-clad height?
    What the exulting Evoe? [63]
   Why glows the cheek? Whom is't that I, with pinions light,
    Swinging the lofty Thyrsus see?

   Is it the genius whom the gladsome throng obeys?
    Do I his numerous train descry?
   In plenty's teeming horn the gifts of heaven he sways,
    And reels from very ecstacy!--

   See how the golden grape in glorious beauty shines,
    Kissed by the earliest morning-beams!
   The shadow of yon bower, how lovingly it signs,
    As it with countless blessings teams!

   Ha! glad October, thou art welcome unto me!--
    October's first-born, welcome thou!
   Thanks of a purer kind, than all who worship thee,
    More heartfelt thanks I'm bringing now!

   For thou to me the one whom I have loved so well,
    And love with fondness to the grave,
   Who merits in my heart forevermore to dwell,--
    The best of friends in Rieger [64] gave.

   'Tis true thy breath doth rock the leaves upon the trees,
    And sadly make their charms decay;
   Gently they fall:--and swift, as morning phantasies
    With those who waken, fly away.

   'Tis true that on thy track the fleecy spoiler hastes,
    Who makes all Nature's chords resound
   With discord dull, and turns the plains and groves to wastes,
    So that they sadly mourn around.

   See how the gloomy forms of years, as on they roll,
    Each joyous banquet overthrows,
   When, in uplifted hand, from out the foaming bowl,
    Joy's noble purple brightly flows!

   See how they disappear, when friends sweet converse hold,
    And loving wander arm-in-arm;
   And, to revenge themselves on winter's north wind cold,
    Upon each other's breasts grow warm!

   And when spring's children smile upon us once again,
    When all the youthful splendor bright,
   When each melodious note of each sweet rapturous strain
    Awakens with it each delight:

   How joyous then the stream that our whole soul pervades!
    What life from out our glances pours!
   Sweet Philomela's song, resounding through the glades,
    Ourselves, our youthful strength restores!

   Oh, may this whisper breathe--(let Rieger bear in mind
    The storm by which in age we're bent!)--
   His guardian angel, when the evening's star so kind
    Gleams softly from the firmament!

   In silence be he led to yonder thundering height,
   And guided be his eye, that he,
   In valley and on plain, may see his friends aright.
   And that, with growing ecstacy,

   On yonder holy spot, when he their number tells,
    He may experience friendship's bliss,
   Now first unveiled, until with pride his bosom swells,
    Conscious that all their love is his.

   Then will the distant voice be loudly heard to say:
    "And G--, too, is a friend of thine!
   When silvery locks no more around his temples play,
    G-- still will be a friend of thine!"

   "E'en yonder"--and now in his eye the crystal tear
    Will gleam--"e'en yonder he will love!
   Love thee too, when his heart, in yonder spring-like sphere,
    Linked on to thine, can rapture prove!"


        EPITAPH.

   Here lies a man cut off by fate
    Too soon for all good men;
   For sextons he died late--too late
    For those who wield the pen.


          QUIRL.

   You tell me that you feel surprise
   Because Quirl's paper's grown in size;
   And yet they're crying through the street
   That there's a rise in bread and meat.


        THE PLAGUE.

        A PHANTASY.

   Plague's contagious murderous breath
    God's strong might with terror reveals,
   As through the dreary valley of death
    With its brotherhood fell it steals!

   Fearfully throbs the anguish-struck heart,
    Horribly quivers each nerve in the frame;
    Frenzy's wild laughs the torment proclaim,
   Howling convulsions disclose the fierce smart.
