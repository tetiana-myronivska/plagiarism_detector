THINGS MOTHER USED TO MAKE

By LYDIA MARIA GURNEY

A COLLECTION OF OLD TIME RECIPES, SOME NEARLY ONE HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND
NEVER PUBLISHED BEFORE

New York
1914


AUTHOR'S FOREWORD

Good food depends as largely upon the judgment of the cook, as upon the
materials used. These recipes and Household Hints are written very
plainly, for those who have had no experience, no practice and possibly
have little judgment.

They are very simple, not expensive, and if followed closely, will
ensure success. It is the hope of the writer of this book that the
young and inexperienced housekeeper may find it a real help.

L.M. GURNEY.


INTRODUCTION

The Things Mother Used To Make consist of old fashioned recipes, which
have been for the most part handed down by word of mouth from one
generation to another, extending over a period of nearly one hundred
years. The author, a New England woman, has during her life tested out
in her own kitchen the greater part of these recipes, which represent
the best cookery of those times.

This material was originally published in _Suburban Life_, where
it obtained such recognition as seemed to warrant its preservation in
book form. The original material has accordingly been amplified, and it
is here presented as one of the volumes in the series of Countryside
Manuals.

EGGS


=To Boil Eggs=

Put your eggs into a bowl which can be sent to the table. Pour boiling
water over them and let stand eight or ten minutes. It is essential
that the water be boiling. This way of boiling eggs, though so simple,
is going out of fashion, unfortunately, as it makes a wonderful
difference in the appearance of the egg when broken open, and above
all, in its digestibility. Eggs should never be boiled in any other way
for invalids.


=Eggs on Toast=

Toast as many slices of bread as desired. Butter well and pour over
these just enough salted water to soften. Have ready a dish of boiling
water. Stir it round and round with a spoon or fork, break the egg and
drop into this swirling water. Remove from the water in from four to
six minutes, as preferred, and place one on each slice of bread. Serve
hot, with a dash of pepper, if liked.


=Plain Omelette=

2 Eggs
2 Teaspoonfuls of Water
Pinch of Salt

Beat whites and yolks separately. Put together, salt, and add water.
Pour onto a hot buttered frying pan and fry one side until it is puffed
up, then turn half over and serve at once.


=Ham Omelette=

Make a plain omelette and add two-thirds of a cupful of chopped boiled
ham. Pour into the hot frying pan and cook both sides.


=New England Poached Eggs=

4 Eggs
8 Tablespoonfuls of Milk
Butter the size of a Walnut
1/2 Teaspoonful of Salt

Break the eggs into a sauce pan with milk, salt and butter. Cook until
they thicken, stirring constantly. Remove from fire before it wheys.
Serve hot with a dash of pepper.


       *       *       *       *       *       *


=FISH=


=Clam Fritters=

1 Egg
1 Cupful of Milk
1 Cupful of Bread-flour and a Little Salt

Beat the egg and half the milk, adding the flour gradually, to make the
batter smooth. Salt, and add the last half-cupful of milk. Put one clam
into one teaspoonful of batter and drop into boiling lard. Serve hot.


=Fish Balls=

1 Cupful of Hot Mashed Potatoes
1/2 Cupful of Shredded Cod-fish
2 Teaspoonfuls of Melted Butter
2 Tablespoonfuls of Milk

Put the fish into a piece of cheese-cloth, let cold water run over it,
and squeeze dry. Mix ingredients all together. Take a little flour in
the hand and roll half a tablespoonful of the mixture between the
palms, to the size of a small peach. Fry in deep fat.


=To Boil a Lobster=

Have a large kettle on the fire with plenty of boiling water, deep
enough to cover the lobster well. Put into this one cupful of salt, if
you cannot get the sea-water. When the water is galloping, put in the
lobster, head foremost, and keep it under water. Boil from twenty to
thirty-five minutes according to size.


=To Dress Lobsters Cold=

Crack the shell of the claws carefully, remove the meat and place on a
platter. Turn the lobster on its back, lay a heavy knife on the middle
of the tail, all the way up to the body. Give it a gentle blow with a
hammer, then with both hands turn back the shell and draw out the tail
intact. Twist off the claws from the under side of the body and remove
the body from the shell. Open and remove the stomach and sandbags. Open
the tail in length, halfway through, on the under side, remove the
black vein from the body to the end. Dress with parsley and serve.


=Baked Mackerel=

1 Mackerel
3 Small Slices of Salt Pork
Salt to Taste

Split open the mackerel, remove head and insides, wash clean, and lay
in a baking-pan on a well buttered paper or cheese-cloth, the skin side
down. Spread over this slices of salt pork and a little salt. Bake in
moderate oven for twenty minutes, or half an hour. This is much nicer
than fried mackerel.


=Oysters on Toast=

Toast as many slices of bread as you require. Wipe enough oysters to
cover them and season with pepper and salt. Put a little hot water over
the bread and place in a very hot oven, until the edges of the oysters
curl. Serve hot, with a white sauce.


=Baked Shad=

Make a nice dressing of five or six crackers, according to size of
family (bread crumbs will do). Roll fine, or soak until soft in milk
(water will do). Season to taste with poultry dressing, salt and add a
small piece of butter. Wash the shad and stuff. Have a large sheet of
white paper, well buttered, or a piece of cheese-cloth. Put into a
baking-pan and set in the oven. Bake one hour. Spanish mackerel is fine
baked in the same way.

Potatoes
Salt

Take three pounds of a cheap cut of beef. Wash, put into an iron pan,
sprinkle over it salt to taste. Pare six onions, more or less, according
to size of family, and prepare four or five small white turnips sliced
thin. Lay these around the meat, and pour over all a quart of cold
water. Put into the oven and bake three hours. Pare potatoes enough
for the family, putting them in an hour and a half before serving.
This is a most delicious way to cook beef. As the water cooks away,
add more. Thicken the gravy, with flour wet with water, as you would
with any roast meat.


=Beefsteak Pie=

2 Pounds of Beef (any cheap cut will do)
1 Onion
1 Tablespoonful of Salt

Cut the meat into small pieces; cover with cold water, salt and put
into the oven; cut the onion into small pieces and add. Bake three
hours in an earthen dish. Half an hour before serving, put over the top
a crust, made of two cupfuls of flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls of
baking-powder, one-half teaspoonful of salt, and one tablespoonful of
lard. Wet with water or milk, as for biscuits.


=Beef Stew with Dumplings=

plate, on top of the meat; cover and let boil twenty minutes. Lift them
out, and thicken the stew with three dessertspoonfuls of flour, wet
with a scant cup of water.


=New England Boiled Dinner=

This consists of corned beef, white and sweet potatoes, cabbage, beets,
turnips, squash, parsnips and carrots. The quantity depends upon the
size of the family. Eight pounds of meat is sufficient for a family of
eight. Boil the meat four hours, the beets three hours, the cabbage one
and a half hours, squash and turnips three-quarters of an hour. Boil
these in one kettle, all together. Beets, carrots and parsnips should
be boiled with the skin on. Pare the potatoes, pare and slice the
squash and turnip. Pick the outer leaves from cabbage and cut in
quarters. When done, pare parsnips and carrots. Drop the beets into
cold water and slip the skin off with the hand.


=Brunswick Stew=

1 Chicken or 3 Pounds of Lamb
1 Onion
4 Potatoes
4 Ears of Corn
Salt and Pepper
6 Tomatoes

Cook the chicken or lamb until tender in two quarts of water. Take from
the water and chop fine. Put back in the liquor, add the corn, cut from
the cob, tomatoes, onion, and potatoes all chopped, salt and pepper to
taste. Cook two hours. In winter this can be made by using canned corn
and tomatoes.


=How to Corn Beef=

A piece of fresh beef weighing seven or eight pounds is sufficient for
a family of eight. Wash, clean and put it in an earthen dish, twenty-four
hours before cooking. Cover with cold water, and add a cup and a
half of ice-cream salt. When ready to cook it, remove from the brine
and wash, placing it in cold water. Cook four hours.


=Corn Beef Hash=

Corned Beef
Milk
Potatoes
Salt and Pepper
Lump of Butter

Chop the meat fine, add the same bulk of potatoes or a little more. Put
into a saucepan or spider a lump of butter the size of an egg, and a
few spoonfuls of milk or water. When bubbling, put in the meat and
potatoes, and a little salt and pepper, if you like. Stir for a while,
then let it stand ten or fifteen minutes, until a crust is formed at
the bottom. Loosen from the pan with a cake-turner. Turn a warm platter
over it. Turn pan and hash together quickly and serve. If you have a
scant quantity, place it on slices of toasted bread, which have been
buttered and wet with hot water.


=Breaded Pork Chops=

6 Chops
1 Cupful of Bread Crumbs
1 Egg
Pinch of Salt

Salt to taste

three or four hours. Add salt and onions, cut fine. Put the tomato
through a colander. Boil all together, and, as the water boils away,
add more. Serve the meat hot. The liquor makes a delicious soup,
thickened with two tablespoonfuls of flour.


=A Fine Way to Cook Veal=

2 Pounds of Veal, or according to size of family
1 Egg
Bread Crumbs
Milk, Salt and Pepper

Cut the veal into small pieces, a good size for serving, and season
with salt and pepper. Dip into the egg, which has been beaten light,
then into the bread crumbs. Have a little pork fat (lard will do) in a
frying-pan, and cook until brown. Set on the back of the stove and cook
slowly for ten minutes. Cover with milk, and bake in the oven very
slowly for one hour in a covered pan. The toughest veal, cooked in this
way, will be as tender as chicken.


=Veal Patties=

1 1/2 Cupfuls of Boiled Rice
1 Cupful of Veal
1 Teaspoonful of Salt
1/2 Teaspoonful of Poultry Dressing
1 Egg
1 Tablespoonful of Milk

Grind or chop the veal, salt and stir into the rice with the dressing;
beat the eggs, add milk, and stir all together. Drop a tablespoonful
spread out thin on the griddle, and fry as you would griddle-cakes.

compressed yeast. Put this into a pitcher or dish which will hold three
pints; place in a warm spot to rise; keep covered. Use two-thirds of a
cupful to one quart of flour. This recipe has been in use over fifty
years.

be made in the summer from watermelon-rind. Cut off all the pink of the
melon, pare, and prepare as you would citron. It is really very nice.

for five minutes. Set back on the stove and let it settle, then skim
very thoroughly. Pare, cut in half, and remove the stones from the
peaches. When the syrup comes to a boil, put in enough peaches to fill
your jar, whatever the size. Boil until tender enough to pierce with a
wisp. Take the fruit out carefully with a spoon and place in the jar.
Fill the jar with the boiling syrup, being careful always to cant the
jar as you pour it in. If you do this, the jar will never crack, as it
is likely to do if held perfectly straight or upright. Always run
around the inside of the jar with a silver knife, and you will have no
trouble in keeping fruit. Seal while hot. The peaches may be canned
whole, if preferred.

quinces and cook until of a dark amber color-for about an hour. As
quinces are expensive, old-fashioned people used to put in one-fourth
as much sweet apple or pear.


=Raspberry Jam, No. I=

Mash the berries, add equal parts of sugar, and let stand half an hour.
Put on the stove in a kettle containing a half cupful of water, to

chimneys. Old pieces of calico, or flannel make good holders to use
about the stove. Wash, boil and dry cleaning cloths when soiled, that
they may be ready for use again.


=That Leaky Hot-Water Bag=

Do not throw away an old hot-water bag because it leaks. Fasten over
the leak, a strong piece of adhesive plaster. Fill the bag with sand or
salt and cover with flannel. It will hold heat for a long time, and can
be used instead of the water bottle.


=To Keep your Hands White=

Keep a piece of lemon in your bathroom or kitchen. It will remove
stains from the hands.


=To Brown Flour=

Spread flour upon a tin pie plate, put it in a hot oven, and stir
constantly, after it begins to brown, until it is all colored. Keep
always on hand. It is good for coloring and thickening gravies.


=Lemons and Fish=

Lemon juice makes a very grateful addition to all kinds of fish. Thin
slices of lemon, with sprigs of parsley, around a platter of fish,
makes a pretty garnish.


=To Try out Lard=

If you want good sweet lard, buy from your butcher, leaf lard. Skin
carefully, cut into small pieces and put it into a kettle or sauce pan.
Pour in a half-cupful of water, to prevent burning, and cook slowly,
until there is nothing left but scraps. Remove the scraps with a
skimmer, salt it a little, and strain through a clean cloth, into tin
pails. Be sure not to scorch it.


=How to Keep Eggs=

In the summer, when eggs are cheap, buy a sufficient number of freshly
laid ones to last through the winter.

Take one part of liquid glass, and nine parts of cold water which has
been boiled, and mix thoroughly.

Put the eggs into a stone crock, and pour over them this mixture,
having it come an inch above the eggs. The eggs will keep six months,
if they are perfectly fresh when packed and will have no taste, as when
put into lime water.


=Save your Old Stockings=

Old stockings are fine for cleaning the range. Slip your hand into the
foot and rub hard, or place an old whisk broom inside. It will make the
sides and front of the range clean and shiny. In fact, you will seldom
need to use blacking on these parts.


=When Washing Lamp Chimneys=

If you live in the country and use kerosene lamps, do not dread washing
the chimneys. Make a good hot suds, then wash them in this, with a
clean cloth kept for that purpose. Pour over them very hot or boiling
water and dry with an old soft cloth. Twist a piece of brown paper or
newspaper, into  cornucopia shape and place over the chimneys to
protect from dust and flies.


=To Remove Disagreeable Odors from the House=

Sprinkle fresh ground coffee, on a shovel of hot coals, or burn sugar
on the shovel. This is an old-fashioned disinfectant, still good.


=To Lengthen the Life of a Broom=

Your broom will last much longer and be made tough and pliable, by
dipping for a minute or two, in a pail of boiling suds, once a week. A
carpet will wear longer if swept with a broom treated in this way.
Leave your broom bottom side up, or hang it.


=To Prevent Mold on Top of Glasses of Jelly=

Melt paraffine and pour over the jelly after it is cold. No brandy,
paper, or other covering is necessary.


=To Clean Nickel Stove Trimmings=

Rub with kerosene and whiting, and polish with a dry cloth.


=To Clean Zinc or Copper=

Wash with soap suds and powdered bristol brick. When perfectly dry,
take a flannel cloth and dry powdered bristol or any good cleaning
powder and polish. You will be pleased with the result. I have tried
this for forty years.


=How to Prevent Button Holes from Fraying=

When making button holes in serge or any material which frays, place a
piece of lawn of two thicknesses, underneath and work through this.

Another way is to make four stitchings in the goods the length of the
button hole. Cut between these, leaving two stitchings each side of the
hole.


=When Making a Silk Waist=

Stitch a crescent shaped piece of the same material as your waist under
the arm. It will wear longer and when the outside wears out it looks
neater than a patch. If the waist is lined, put this between the lining
and the outside.


=To Make Old Velvet Look New=

Turn hot flatirons bottom side up. Rest these on two pieces of wood, or
hold in your lap. Put over them a piece of wet cloth, then lay the
velvet on this. Brush with a whisk broom. The steam from the wet cloth
will raise the nap and take out the creases.


=Onion Skins as a Dye=

If you wish for a bright yellow, save your onion skins. They will color
white cloth a very bright yellow. This is a good color for braided
rugs, such as people used to make.


=To Remove Egg Stain from Silver=

Salt when applied dry, with a soft piece of flannel will remove the
stain from silver, caused by eggs.


=Put a Little Cornstarch in Salt Shakers=

This will prevent the salt from becoming too moist to shake out.


=How to Color Lace Ecru=

If you wish for ecru lace and you have only a piece of white, dip it
into cold tea or coffee, until you have the desired color.


=To Keep Lettuce Crisp=

Put it into a paper bag and place right on the ice. It will keep a week
in this way.


=To Keep Celery=

Do not put it into water. Wrap it in a cloth, wet in cold water and
place directly on the ice.


=To Keep a Piece of Salt Pork Sweet=

Put it in a strong brine made of one quart of cold water, and two-thirds
of a cup of salt.


=Save Potato-Water=

Pare potatoes before boiling, and then save the water, to mix your
yeast bread with.


=A Use for the Vinegar Off Pickles=

When your pickles have been used from your glass jars, do not throw
away the vinegar. Use it in your salad dressing. It is much better than
plain vinegar because of the flavor.


=Do not Allow a Child to Eat Fresh Snow=

This often looks clean and pure but fill a tumbler with it, cover to
keep out the dust and then show it to the child, that he may see for
himself, the dirt it contains.


=When Making Hermits or Cookies=

Instead of rolling and cutting as usual, drop the dough into a large
iron pan. The heat of the oven melts them into one sheet. Cut them into
squares or long narrow strips. It takes much less time, than the old
way of rolling and cutting.


=To Clean a Vinegar Cruet on the Inside=

Put into it shot, pebblestones, or beans. Fill it with a strong soap
suds, and one teaspoonful of bread soda or ammonia. Let stand an hour,
shake well and often. Rinse with clean water.


=To Make Tough Meat, or a Fowl Tender=

Put one tablespoonful of vinegar, into the kettle while boiling.


=To Remove Black Grease=

Rub patiently with ether. It will not leave a ring, like gasolene, and
will remove every trace of the stain.


=To Keep an Iron Sink from Rusting=

Wash with hot suds. When dry rub it well, with a cloth wet with
kerosene. Do this three or four times a week and your sink will look
well, all the time.


=How to Add Salt to Hot Milk=

Salt will curdle new milk, so when making gravies, or puddings, put
your salt into the flour, or with eggs and sugar, to add when the milk
boils. Use a double boiler for milk gravies and gruels.


=To Soften Boots and Shoes=

Rub them with kerosene. Shoes will last longer, if rubbed over with
drippings from roast lamb. Old-fashioned people always used mutton
tallow on children's shoes.


=A Way to Cook Chops=

Pork or lamb chops are very nice, if baked in a hot oven. Turn them as
they brown. It saves the smoke in the room.


=When Cooking Canned Corn=

Place it in a double boiler to prevent scorching.


=Salted Almonds=

Shell the nuts and put into boiling water. When they have stood for
fifteen or twenty minutes, the skin will slip off easily. When dry, mix
a half-teaspoonful of olive oil or butter, and a quarter of a
teaspoonful of salt, with a cupful of nut meats. Spread on a tin pan,
and place in a hot oven. Bake fifteen or twenty minutes. Watch closely
and stir several times, as they burn quickly. Treat peanuts in the same
way.


=Before Washing Colored Clothes=

It is wise to set the color first, by soaking in a strong solution of
cold salt water (one cupful of salt to half a pail of water). Soak two
hours.


=To Remove Iron Rust from White Goods=

The old-fashioned way, still good, is to wet the place in lemon juice,
sprinkle on it common table salt, and lay it in the sun. In these later
days, there is on the market an iron rust soap, which removes the spot
quickly, also an ink eradicator, sold by all druggists.


=How to Make Starch=

Two tablespoonfuls of starch should be made into a smooth paste with
four tablespoonfuls of cold water. Pour over this three pints of
boiling water, stirring rapidly all the time. Starch the garments,
while they are still wet. In the olden days, people made starch of
flour in the same way, for linen and gingham dresses, as it was less
expensive and thought to be just as good for colored clothes.


=When you Go Away from Home for a Few Days=

Plan your meals before leaving. This simplifies matters for the one
left in charge, and is often found to be of importance financially.


=The Proper Way to Sweep a Room=

Dust the furniture and put it in another room. Dust bric-a-brac and put
on the bed if you are sweeping a sleeping room, if another room put
them on the table, or in an adjoining room. Brush the draperies, take
down and lay on the bed or table. Cover these and bric-a-brac with a
sheet. Wet a newspaper, tear into small pieces and spread on the rug or
carpet. Now you are ready for sweeping. If the floor is carpeted, sweep
all dirt to the center of the room. Sweep the corners with a small
whisk broom. Move every piece of furniture lest there be dirt left
underneath. Open the windows before sweeping. When the dust is settled
take a pail of warm water, put in a tablespoonful of ammonia, then with
a clean cloth wrung from this wipe the window glass, mirror and
pictures; polish with dry cloth. Wipe all finger marks from doors and
mop boards.

Now take a pail of clean water, with ammonia, and with a small
scrubbing brush go over the rug or carpet, to remove dust and brighten
the colors. Replace furniture, bric-a-brac and draperies and your room
will be sweet and clean. With care, once in two or three weeks, will be
often enough to do this.


=When Baking Cup Custards=

Set them into a pan of hot water. When you remove from the oven, place
them in a pan of cold water, to prevent longer cooking.


=When Using Currants and Raisins=

Mix a little dry flour with currants and raisins before adding them to
cakes or puddings. It will keep them from falling to the bottom.


=Try Baking Beets, Instead of Boiling Them=

They are much sweeter. Three or four hours is necessary, according to
size.


=When Making Grape Juice or Jelly=

Before adding the sugar, strain through a flannel bag. It will be much
clearer.


=When Sewing Braid on a Dress=

Slip a piece of pasteboard three or four inches long, into the hem. You
can sew more quickly, and your stitches will not show on the right side.


=To Skin Beets=

When you remove beets from the kettle, plunge them into a dish of cold
water. The skins will slip off easily with the hand. Never cut or pare
beets before cooking.


=A Fine Way to Keep Cut Roses=

Immerse them at night in a pail of cold water, blossoms down.


=To Keep Carnations=

Put a little salt in the water, which should be changed each morning,
and cut the stems a little each time.


=When Pies are Ready to Bake=

Put little dabs of lard, on the top crust, then hold it under the
faucet, letting cold water run over it.


=A Way to Make Pies Brown and Shiny=

Just before putting a pie in the oven, brush over the top with milk,
using a soft brush or a clean piece of cheese cloth.


=When Threading a Needle=

Place a piece of white paper under the eye. You will be surprised at
the ease, with which you can thread it.


=Make your Own Baking Powder=

Get your grocer to weigh for you one pound of cream of tartar, and one-half
pound of bread soda. Sift these together nine times in a flour
sifter. Put in a tin can, and it is ready for use.


=To Prevent Children from Losing Mittens=

Sew strongly to each mitten, four or five inches of narrow black ribbon
(use a colored one if you prefer). Sew the other end of ribbon to the
coat sleeve. The child can remove mittens at any time without losing
them and always know where they are.


=Teach a Child to Hang up his Own Coat and Hat=

Have some hooks, low down in the closet or kitchen where a child can
reach them easily, to be used only by himself.


=To Keep your Own Umbrella=

Take a piece of narrow white tape, three or four inches long. With a
glass pen, or a new clean steel one, and indelible ink, write your name
upon it. Sew this to the inside of the umbrella.


=To Wash a White Silk Waist, or a Baby's Bonnet=

Use cold water and white soap. Hot water will turn white silk yellow.


=When Ironing Embroidery=

Place it right side down on a piece of soft flannel, ironing on the
wrong side. If flannel is not at hand, try an old turkish towel.


=To Wash Small Pieces of Lace=

Put in a horse radish bottle and pour over them, strong soap suds, good
and hot, and shake well. Let stand awhile and shake again. Rinse in
clear, warm water, by shaking. Dry on a clean cloth in the sunshine.


=Never Throw away Sour Milk=

It is excellent for graham bread, gingerbread, brown bread, griddle
cakes, and doughnuts, also biscuit.

You can make a delicious cottage cheese of a very small quantity.

Set the milk on the back of the stove, in an agate dish. Let stand
until the whey separates from the curd. Strain through a cloth,
squeezing the curd dry. Put in a little salt, a small piece of butter,
and a little sage if desired. Press into balls and serve.


=Mark New Rubbers=

Take a pointed stick--a wooden skewer from the butcher's is best--dip
it into ink and write the name, on the inside.


=Economical Hints=

Save small pieces of soap in the bathroom, by placing in a cup or small
box, until you have a cupful. Add a little water and boil a few minutes;
when nearly cool, press with the hands, and you have a new cake of soap.

Do not throw away the white papers around cracker boxes. They are good
to clean irons and will save buying ironing wax. If irons are dirty put
a good layer of salt on newspaper and rub the irons back and forth.

Save even the coupons on your soap wrappers. You can get a silver
thimble for your mending bag with them, if nothing more.

Save your strong string, to wrap around packages going by parcel post.
Also fold nicely for further use your clean wrapping papers. Make a bag
of pretty cretonne, hang in the kitchen or cellar way, to keep the
string and wrapping paper in. You will find it very convenient.

Do not throw away small pieces of bread. Save them for plum pudding,
queen's pudding, or dressing for fish or fowl. If broken into small
pieces and browned in a hot oven, it is very nice to eat with soups.
Or, dry well, roll fine and keep in a glass jar, to be used for breaded
pork chops, croquettes, or oysters.



=To Mend Broken China=

Stir into a strong solution of gum arabic, plaster of Paris. Put this
on each side of the china, holding together for a few minutes. Make it
as thick as cream.



=To Clean Old Jewelry=

Wash in warm water containing a little ammonia. If very dirty rub with
a brush. This is very good also for cleaning hair brushes and combs.



=Dish Washing Made a Pleasure=

First of all, remove all refuse from the dishes. Place them near the
sink, large plates at the bottom, then the smaller ones, then saucers.
Have a large pan full of very hot water. Make a good soap suds by using
a soap shaker. Wash the tumblers and all glassware first, and wipe at
once. Use a handle dish cloth (which can be bought for five cents), for
these, as the water will be too hot for the hands.

Wash the silver next. Have a large pan, in which to place the clean
dishes, cups and bowls first. When all are washed pour over them
boiling or very hot water, and wipe quickly. Pans and kettles come
last. Always have a cake of sand soap or a can of cleaning powder, for
scouring the pie plates and bottoms of kettles. It is very little work
to keep baking tins and kitchen utensils in good condition, if washed
perfectly clean each time they are used.

Wash the dish towels, at least once every day, and never use them for
anything else. With clean hot water, clean towels, and plenty of soap
dishwashing is made easy.

If you live in New England, your sink will be in front of a window. Be
sure and plant just outside of this window nasturtiums, a bed of
pansies, morning glories and for fall flowers, salvia. These bright
blossoms will add to your pleasure while washing dishes.



=A Space Saver=

If you are crowded for space in closet, kitchen or pantry buy a spiral
spring, such as is used for sash curtains. Fasten the end pieces to the
back of the door, and stretch the spring from end to end. You now have
a fine place to hang towels, stockings or neckties, or if used in a
pantry, to keep covers.



=Another Space Saver=

If you have no closet in your room, get a board, nine inches wide, and
three or four feet long. Put it in the most convenient place in your
room on two brackets. Stain it the color of your woodwork. Screw into
the under side of the board, wardrobe hooks. Now get a pretty piece of
cretonne or denim, hem top and bottom, and tack with brass headed tacks
to the shelf, having it long enough to come to the floor, and around
the ends of the board. Use the top for a book shelf or hats.



=If the Freshness of Eggs is Doubtful=

Break each one separately into a cup, before mixing together. Yolks and
whites beaten separately, make a cake much lighter than when beaten
together.



=When Bread Cooks Too Quickly=

When your bread is browning on the outside, before it is cooked inside,
put a clean piece of brown paper over it. This will prevent scorching.



=To Remove the Odor of Onions=

Fill with cold water kettles and sauce pans in which they have been
cooked adding a tablespoonful of bread soda and the same of ammonia.
Let stand on the stove until it boils. Then wash in hot suds and rinse
well. A pudding or bean pot, treated in this way, will wash easily.
Wood ashes in the water will have the same effect.



=Never Leave a Glass of Water or Medicine, Uncovered in a Room=

This is very _important_. Water will absorb all the gases, with
which a room is filled from the respiration of those sleeping in the
room.



=Weights and Measures=

4 Teaspoonsfuls equal 1 tablespoonful of liquid.

4 Tablespoonfuls equal half a gill.

2 Coffee-cupfuls equal 1 pint.

2 Pints equal 1 quart.

4 Coffee-cupfuls of sifted flour equal 1 pound.

1 Quart of unsifted flour equals 1 pound.

1 Pint of granulated sugar equals 1 pound.

1 Coffee-cupful of cold butter pressed down equals 1 pound.

An ordinary tumbler holds the same as a coffee cup.

It is well to have a tin or glass cup, marked in thirds or quarters for
measuring.



=When to Salt Vegetables=

Every kind of food and all kinds of vegetables need a little salt when
cooking. Do not wait until the vegetables are done. Salt the water they
are boiled in after they begin to boil.



=What to Serve With Meats=


_Roast Beef and Turkey_

Squash, turnips, onions and cranberry sauce.


_Roast Pork_

Spinach, onions and apple sauce.


_Roast Lamb_

Mint sauce.


_Roast Mutton_

Currant jelly and vegetables.

With all kinds of meat and fowl pickles are always good. Make your own
pickles, after recipes found in this book.



=The Length of Time to Cook Meats=

_Lamb_

Roast a leg of lamb three hours. Wash clean, sprinkle over it a little
flour and salt and put into a pan, with cold water. While it is
cooking, take a spoon and pour over it the water from the pan, three or
four times.


_Veal_

Roast veal three hours, treating it the same way as lamb. When you have
removed it from the pan, make a smooth paste, by wetting two or three
tablespoonfuls of flour with cold water, and stir into the water left
in the pan. Pour in more water, if the size of your family requires it.


_Beef_

Roast beef requires fifteen minutes for each pound. Do not salt beef,
until you take it from the oven.


_Ham_

Boil a ham of ordinary size three hours. Let cool in the water in which
it is boiled. It is very nice to remove the skin, while warm, stick
cloves in the outside, sprinkle over it a little vinegar and sugar and
bake for one hour.


_Sausages_

Sausages are very nice, baked in a hot oven twenty minutes. Prick with
a fork to prevent bursting. Do this too, if fried.


_Corned Beef_

Should boil four hours.


_Chicken_

A chicken will cook in one hour and a half. A fowl requires an hour
longer. Don't forget to put in one tablespoonful of vinegar to make
tender.


_Turkey_

A ten pound turkey needs to cook three hours, in a slow oven.



=The Length of Time to Cook Vegetables=


_Onions_

Boil one hour. Longer if they are large.


_Cabbage_

Requires one hour and a half.


_Parsnips_

Boil two or three hours according to size.


_Carrots_

Wash, scrape, and boil one hour.



=When Paring Tomatoes=

Put them into very hot water and the skin will come off easily.
